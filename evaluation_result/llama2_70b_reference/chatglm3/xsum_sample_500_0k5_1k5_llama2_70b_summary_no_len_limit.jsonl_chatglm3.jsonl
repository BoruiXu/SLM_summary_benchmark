Britain's three remaining sides in the competition have reached this stage for the second successive season, with champions Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Barcelona also still in. The draw takes place at 11:00 GMT in Nyon, Switzerland. Liverpool, who failed to qualify, join Celtic, Everton and Tottenham in the following Europa League last-32 draw. Chelsea will be in pot one after winning their group, while Manchester City and Arsenal join the group runners-up in pot two. No teams that progressed from the same group or are from the same country can be drawn against each other, so among the sides Jose Mourinho's side could meet are Serie A champions Juventus and French champions Paris St-Germain. Manchester City, who won 2-0 at Roma on Wednesday to qualify, and Arsenal's list of potential opponents include La Liga champions Atletico Madrid, Real Madrid, and Barcelona. The Gunners could also be drawn against Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich, who topped Manchester City's group. Liverpool, Tottenham and Celtic could face difficult ties in the last 32 of the Europa League after not being seeded for the draw. Tottenham and Celtic were second in their Europa League groups while Liverpool dropped down from the Champions League after finishing third in their group. That leaves Everton as the only seeded British team in the draw for the last 32, joining the likes of Inter Milan, Napoli and Zenit St Petersburg.

BBC pundit Alan Shearer explains why Arsenal's defensive display played as big a part as their attacking power in securing their one-sided FA Cup final win over Aston Villa. Just about every tactical decision that Wenger made for the final came off, starting with him picking Theo Walcott up front instead of Olivier Giroud. Media playback is not supported on this device He also got his team playing at the right tempo. They put their stamp on the game from the start, unlike the way they started against Reading in their semi-final. That day, they struggled to impose themselves against Championship opponents. Against Aston Villa I never thought they were in any danger of losing, right from the first minute. In the past, Arsenal have not always performed under pressure and people have asked whether they can cope when they are expected to win. On Saturday they answered that question and better than ever before. Arsenal were outstanding. They were by far the better team and thoroughly deserved their victory. Starting with Walcott, not Giroud, was a big call - and Wenger would have got a lot of stick if he had got it wrong. After seeing Walcott score a hat-trick against West Brom on the final day of the season, I said on Match of the Day that I thought Wenger should - and would - stick with him. He did and it proved to be the right decision. My only worry about the way Arsenal had started the game was the fact they could not find a finish, but Walcott showed with his goal why he can be an out-and-out striker with his movement into the box and then his ruthless finish. Arsenal could have been two or three goals up by the time Walcott scored and they were great to watch when they came forward. But they were also exceptional without the ball, in the way they stopped Villa from posing any threat whatsoever. They did not even manage a shot that reached the Arsenal goal. None of the things that Tim Sherwood has changed and improved in Villa's attack since he took charge in February were evident at Wembley. Villa were brilliant going forward in their semi-final win over Liverpool but Liverpool allowed them to play like that. Arsenal's defensive discipline did not let it happen. This time we did not see anything of Tom Cleverley, Fabian Delph or Jack Grealish on the ball and that meant Christian Benteke could not do any damage. Villa were totally outplayed. Media playback is not supported on this device I have twice felt the pain of losing an FA Cup final. It will be worse for Villa after a performance like that. The fact Arsenal were so good will not be any consolation to Sherwood because his team did not turn up. I know him well from our days playing in the Blackburn team that won the Premier League title in 1995 and he will be devastated and angry at the way his team performed. He was proud to have reached the final and also of the fact he kept Villa up, which was his main aim, but he will be hurting after that defeat. Could he have done anything differently? I don't think so. There was a gulf in class between the two teams and Sherwood could only play with what he had. He clearly did not have enough to live with Arsenal - sometimes it is as simple as that. Arsenal were by far the better team but they had some brilliant individual displays too. Media playback is not supported on this device I know Santi Cazorla was fantastic but my man of the match was Alexis Sanchez and not just because of his magnificent goal. I am always a bit biased towards forward players but Sanchez's energy has lifted his team all season and it was no different at Wembley. He jinked past players as if they were not there and also leapt above Villa's defence to set up Walcott for his side's opener. It seems he can do just about everything and he is one of the big reasons why Arsenal can look forward to next season with real optimism. Alan Shearer was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan",

        "article": "Somalia's security forces have shot dead a 31-year-old government minister after mistaking him for a militant Islamist, officials have said. He was killed in his vehicle near the presidential palace in the capital, Mogadishu, the officials added. The president has cut short his visit to Ethiopia following Abas Abdullahi Sheikh's killing, state radio reports. He grew up in a refugee camp, and became Somalia's youngest MP in November and a minister in February. Somalia has been wracked by conflict since the long-serving ruler Siad Barre was ousted in 1991. It is currently battling militant Islamists from the al-Shabab group, which is affiliated to al-Qaeda. Security forces on patrol came across a vehicle blocking the road and, thinking it was being driven by militants, opened fire, police Major Nur Hussein told Reuters news agency. Mr Abas was killed \"by mistake - they opened fire on his car accidentally. May God rest his soul\", Mogadishu mayoral spokesman Abdifatah Omar Halane was quoted as saying. A rising star has been killed: Abdirizak Atosh, BBC Somali, Nairobi Somali youth have been robbed of a role model following the shocking death of Mr Abas. Always polite and well-dressed, the former child refugee was widely admired for his determination to succeed. Coming from a prominent religious family, Mr Abas studied at Kenya's prestigious Nairobi University and entered politics last year. He became an MP for the port city of Kismayo in Somalia's Jubbaland region after an electoral college chose him ahead of a government minister who had been on the political scene for more than two decades. Mr Abas' victory showed that Somalis were fed up with the old guard, and were demanding change. Sensing his popularity with the youth, the president appointed him to the cabinet in March. Less than three months later, this rising star has become the latest casualty of more than two decades of violence in Somalia. But in this case some are asking: Has Somalia lost a future president? Mr Abas was given a state funeral in Mogadishu attended by President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed Farmajo, members of parliament, Somali youth and elders. President Farmajo has ordered security chiefs to \"immediately get to the bottom of this unfortunate tragedy\" and make sure the perpetrators were \"brought to book\". Information Minister Abdirahman Osman said several people had been arrested, but did not give details, state-owned Radio Mogadishu reported. Troops are sometimes nervous, and have previously shot officials - and each other - by mistake, says BBC Somalia analyst Abdullahi Abdi. But Mr Abas, the public works minister, is probably the most high-ranking official killed by \"friendly fire\", he adds. Mr Abas grew up in Dadaab camp in Kenya, home to hundreds of thousands of Somalis who fled drought and conflict. The president appointed Mr Abas to the cabinet following his surprise election victory in February. President Farmajo promised to improve security and establish an effective government in Somalia. Much of the country is still under the control of al-Shabab.",

At talks in Moscow, he told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Russia's actions in the Middle East would always be \"responsible\". Mr Netanyahu is concerned by the possibility of Israeli and Russian forces inadvertently trading fire. Israel has periodically struck inside Syria against militants it says have been plotting attacks against it. It has also responded to shellfire from forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who Russia has backed throughout the four-year uprising against his rule. But in the past week, US officials have confirmed reports that the Russian military has sent warplanes, helicopters, tanks, artillery guns, armoured personnel carriers and 200 marines to an airfield near Mr Assad's ancestral home in Latakia province. They believe Moscow plans to turn the airfield into a forward operating base that could allow it to send a large number of troops to Syria and launch air strikes. Israel is believed to have previously targeted Syrian and Iranian weapons convoys in Syria meant for the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, though it has not officially acknowledged this. Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to Moscow comes at a time of deepening Russian military involvement in Syria. The arrival of Russian fixed-wing combat aircraft at the airbase in Latakia only accentuates the questions surrounding Moscow's military presence there. According to satellite photos obtained by Stratfor - a US think-tank - the jets appear to be four Sukhoi Su-30 multi-role fighters and up to a dozen possible SU-25 ground attack aircraft. Their deployment came shortly after initial military-to-military contacts between the US and the Russians at the end of last week. The US is operating warplanes against so-called Islamic State targets in Syrian airspace and Israel too is concerned about the potential constraints on its military freedom of action over southern Syria. That's why Mr Netanyahu visited Moscow. Clearly all three countries need to have some sense of what the other might potentially be doing if a damaging incident is to be avoided - especially if Russia intends to use its aircraft to support the Assad regime. Mr Netanyahu said Iran and Syria were \"trying to set up a second terrorist front on the Golan Heights\", a Syrian plateau which was mostly captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war. Israel annexed the captured section in 1981, in a move not recognised internationally. Mr Putin told Mr Netanyahu that Syria had no interest in attacking Israel. \"We know that the Syrian army and Syria as a whole are in such a state that they have no time for a second front. They need to save their own state,\" he said. Russia acknowledges supplying weapons to Syria and sending military experts to train government forces in their use, but denies they are involved in combat.",

Ms Evans, who is currently suspended from UKIP, said she would \"very much like\" to run but a \"handful of people at the top\" had ensured she could not. Ms Evans' six-month ban for bringing the party into disrepute - claims she has dismissed - means she cannot stand. She said she would back councillor Lisa Duffy to succeed Nigel Farage. Ms Evans said UKIP needed to \"break free of its hard-right image and set itself firmly in the common sense centre-ground\" and also conduct some \"internal reform\". The leadership contest has been prompted by Mr Farage's decision to stand down following the UK's vote to leave the European Union, saying his \"political ambition has been achieved\". In a statement in Westminster, Ms Evans, who had been touted as a possible successor, said: \"I'd very much like to run in that election. \"Unfortunately there are a handful of people at the top of UKIP who, for whatever personal reasons of their own, have made quite sure I can't.\" She claimed the party rulebook had been \"abused\" to suspend her to prevent her from representing the party in May's London Assembly elections and the upcoming leadership contest. Her six-month suspension handed down in March came after an internal disciplinary meeting found she had publicly criticised a fellow candidate and held herself out as a party spokeswoman without authority. Ms Evans - who has always rejected the claims against her - lost a High Court bid to overturn the decision. In the statement, she said: \"I have to face up to reality, there's no way they're going to allow me to put my name on the ballot paper... I've now given up hope of becoming the next leader of UKIP.\" Ms Evans said she had questioned whether to stay on in a party that \"allows, and arguably encourages senior figures to behave like this\", but she said the support from members had made her \"more determined ever not to give up on UKIP\". She also said that with the right leader, the \"sky was the limit for the party\". Endorsing Lisa Duffy, a district councillor for Ramsey in Cambridgeshire, Ms Evans said she was \"the best chance\" UKIP had to \"change, to grow and to thrive\". She said UKIP needed \"a clean break from the past\" to become more like a political party than \"just a rugby club on tour\". Under Ms Duffy's leadership, she argued, the party would be \"more united and consensual\". Prior to her suspension Ms Evans wrote UKIP's 2015 general election manifesto. She was axed from her policy role in the party in-fighting which followed Mr Farage's \"unresignation\" after the general election. Mr Farage has denied her ban was due to criticism of him.",

        "article": "Two retired prison officers are trying to help the men they used to guard to return to the world of employment. Steve Freer and Val Wawrosz, who worked together in HM Prison Leeds, have founded a charity called Tempus Novo to find jobs for prisoners who have served their sentences. They work unpaid in offices opposite the looming Victorian hulk of their old employer. Val used to run the prison print shop with \"the same faces\" turning up time after time and would ask why they had come back into prison. They would explain how they could not get a job, often sending hundreds of applications and getting nowhere, so, as a result, they had turned back to crime. Paul is one of their success stories. After serving nearly nine years in prison, he struggled to find employment. His probation officer suggested he talk to the pair and for the last six months he has been employed by Winder Power, a manufacturer in West Yorkshire. \"They brought me here, got me an interview, got me through the door,\" he said. \"They gave me a chance.\" Steve acknowledged employers were wary of ex-offenders at the start and has found small and medium-sized businesses easier to engage. He takes the boss of each company into the prison and shows them the prisoners hard at work, as \"human beings\". Steve and Val then pre-interview candidates, ensuring they are prepared to do any job, even sweeping the floors as a start. Then they ask the company to give them an interview and treat them like any other applicant. Crucially, they offer support to both employer and employee for 12 months. \"We're there all the time for them,\" said Val, who told me that it can be difficult for ex-offenders, or \"graduates\" as they call them, to \"settle into ordinary employment\". \"The slightest thing can send them off track, so we're there at the end of the phone just to pick them back up so they can keep their jobs,\" he explained. \"The savings are staggering,\" Val said. \"The first 54 guys that we placed into work had between them 838 convictions, which shows you we don't cherry-pick.\" Prisoners with multiple convictions are often hardest to place, but so far the overwhelming majority have kept their jobs. Deteriorating conditions in prisons have encouraged some repeat offenders to try much harder to find work, according to Val and Steve. One man told them: \"I don't really want to go back to prison. It's changed a lot recently.\" Both men say there are not enough staff to deal with problems of violence and legal highs. However, Justice Secretary Liz Truss hopes to address that by announcing the recruitment of 2,100 extra prison officers in England and Wales, in addition to the 400 recently promised. She is planning measures to tackle drug smuggling into jails and to target reoffending rates. More than 100,000 crimes are committed annually by former prisoners. Ms Truss wants to see people improve their education and skills in prisons, so they are more likely to find work. Many ex-offenders find it very difficult to get a job, regardless of their qualifications. Steve told me that throughout his career prison \"was always quite a safe, not overly violent environment. But over the last two, three years, that's changed in many prisons\". Tempus Novo is now working in several prisons. Steve and Val believe their approach could help ex-offenders across the country. \"It would be an incredible win for society,\" said Steve. \"Less crime, less victims, and a huge saving to the taxpayer.\"",

        "article": "When the founders of popular but controversial beer company BrewDog needed a second bank loan to enable them to expand production, their tactic was a simple one - lie through their teeth. It was back in 2008, and James Watt and Martin Dickie's then tiny brewery at Fraserburgh, north-east Scotland, was little over a year old and struggling. Selling their US-style craft beers from the back of their van at farmers' markets, they were missing payments on their \u00a320,000 ($30,000) bank loan. \"We were selling a couple of cases on a good day, and losing money,\" says Mr Watt, now 32. And then they decided to enter a bottled beer competition organised by supermarket group Tesco. BrewDog won first, second, third, and fourth place. \"So we went down to Tesco's headquarters [just north of London], and they told us they loved our beer and wanted to put us in 500 shops, buying 2,000 cases a week,\" says Mr Watt. \"We put on our best poker faces and said 'no problem'. Yet we were just two guys filling bottles by hand.\" With Tesco wanting first deliveries in four months' time, Mr Watt and Mr Dickie, also now 32, went to their bank to ask for another \u00a3150,000, so they could quickly install a bottling line, and expand production. But failing to meet the payments on their existing loan, the bank said a firm \"no\". So the business partners went to another lender, and lied. Mr Watt says: \"We said that our bank had offered us an amazing deal, but that if you can match it we'll switch, and they went for it. You have got to do what you have to do.\" With BrewDog now being able to increase its brewing facilities, it was able to start supplying Tesco on time with bottles of its Punk IPA. The beer was an immediate hit, and the other UK supermarkets soon followed suit. Fast forward to 2014, and BrewDog is due to see its turnover top \u00a332m this year. It employs 357 people, and as well as continuing to supply the likes of Tesco UK-wide, it owns 25 bars, 18 across the UK, and seven abroad. And now based at a larger brewery down the road in the town of Ellon, it exports to 52 countries. Childhood friends who grew up in the Scottish town of Peterhead, Mr Watt and Mr Dickie started brewing beer together as a hobby in their early 20s. At the time Mr Watt was working as a deep sea fisherman, while Mr Dickie was a whisky distiller. From the very start they were inspired to brew American-style craft beers - sweet-tasting ales with high alcohol levels and very large amounts of US hops, which gave them a bold, fruity, even perfumed flavour. They are very Marmite beers in that you either love them or hate them. To fans they are flavoursome and interesting, to critics they are undrinkable. Yet, confident they could convert drinkers, and after some good reviews, Mr Watt and Mr Dickie decided to quit their day jobs and start brewing professionally in 2007. \"Even though the first year was tough, we never lost faith in what we were doing,\" says Mr Watt. \"We were hell-bent... we were stupidly ambitious.\" In addition to the bold flavours, the two men also worked hard on creating an irreverent brand image for BrewDog, giving their beers fun names, and bright, colourful labels. Some of their other brews are called Dead Pony Pale Ale, Dogma and Hardcore IPA. Expansion has been made possible after the business raised \u00a37m via crowdfunding, with 15,000 people paying \u00a395 for a stake in the company. In return they get discounts in BrewDog's bars, and other perks. In more controversial matters, Mr Watt and Mr Dickie have also regularly - and enthusiastically - attacked regulators and industry bodies. Their critics say they do so simply to garner publicity, but Mr Watt says they are merely sticking up for themselves. Earlier this year the Portman Group, the UK drinks industry trade body that promotes responsible drinking, criticised BrewDog, saying that the label of the brewery's Dead Pony Pale Ale promoted anti-social behaviour and binge drinking. BrewDog's response at the time was as follows: \"Unfortunately, the Portman Group is a gloomy gaggle of killjoy jobsworths, funded by navel-gazing international drinks giants.\" When contacted by the BBC for this article, a spokesman for the Portman Group said: \"BrewDog's business model has traditionally used complaints by the public as a PR opportunity for their brands. \"BrewDog and the Portman Group have a long history... we don't expect them to like us, but we were pleased to see they have started relabeling their products.\" There are no hard and fast rules on what makes a \"craft beer\". However, typically it is a natural beer made by a small brewery, often with large amounts of pungent hops and a marked sweetness from the barley malt So what is the difference between \"craft beer\" and \"real ale\"? Unlike craft beer, real ale - as determined by UK pressure group Campaign For Real Ale - has to be unpasteurised and unfiltered. Real ale also more often has a drier flavour. Craft beer is also typically served well chilled and carbonated, whereas real ales are served less cold and have no added gas Yet, like lager (which itself can be a craft beer or real ale), they share the same basic four ingredients - malted barley, hops, yeast and water. In all cases other ingredients can be added on top, such as different grains A similar dispute that BrewDog had in 2013 with the UK's advertising watchdog, the ASA, saw Mr Watt call the officials \"killjoy, self-important pen pushers\". BrewDog has also been criticised for selling some beers with exceptionally high alcohol rates, such as a limited edition ale that was 55% alcohol. Mr Watt says that he and Mr Dickie - who together own a 75% share of the business - remain unrepentant, and simply \"make beers that we want to drink ourselves\". Mr Watt adds that BrewDog's products are bought by beer aficionados, and priced at a premium. He says that if someone is going to abuse alcohol they will be the cheaper, mass market beers that give drinkers \"maximum bang for their buck\". With exports now making up 65% of sales, Mr Watt says they have no plans to slow down the fast-paced growth. \"My worry is that we aren't growing fast enough,\" he says.",
        "target": "BrewDog, a Scottish brewery, was founded by James Watt and Martin Dickie in 2007. They started by brewing beer in a small van and selling it at farmers' markets. They lied to get a second bank loan to expand their business, which allowed them to start supplying their beer to supermarkets. They have since grown and now export to 52 countries. They are known for their bold, hoppy beers and their irreverent brand image. They have also been criticized for their high alcohol content beers and their attacks on regulators and industry bodies.",

        "article": "Mental health lessons should be on the timetable in every secondary school in the UK a new charity has urged. Too many pupils with symptoms of depression or anxiety are let down or ignored, claims charity MindFull. It has launched a new online counselling service to support and advise 11- to 17-year-olds. MindFull's founder Emma-Jane Cross said poor mental health among young people was \"one of the last great medical taboos in the UK today\". The charity's inaugural report calls for a \"sea-change\" in approaches to young people's mental health. In her foreword, Ms Cross describes the scale of the problem as \"epic\" with thousands \"teetering on the brink\" of serious mental illness, risking \"terrible long-term effects\" for both individuals and society at large. Too many \"are having to resort to harming themselves on purpose in order to cope, or worse still are thinking about ending their own lives\", she added later. The report calls for awareness of the importance of mental health to be integrated into every aspect of young people's development particularly in schools and health services. \"We need to move away from only tackling the symptoms of acute poor mental health and well-being to focus on education, prevention and early intervention,\" say the authors. \"Young people need to be encouraged to speak out about their mental health and well-being and feel confident that, when they do, they will receive the support they need as swiftly and as easily as possible.\" The charity says its new online support service will help do this by providing professional counselling and peer support for young people. It says it will also be working with schools to educate young people on how to cope with mental health issues. The charity has the backing of Labour leader Ed Miliband and of campaigners for better mental health support for young people. Psychologist Prof Tanya Byron said: \"Just as we look after our children's physical health, it's vital we offer support for their mental well-being. \"Children and young people are clearly not getting the help they need. That's why this new online support from MindFull is so important.\" Lucie Russell of the YoungMinds charity said: \"Children and young people are growing up in a toxic climate. They exist in a 24/7 online world where they never switch off, where cyberbullying, consumerism and pornography, sexting and the pressure to have the perfect body bombard them daily, where any exam grade below a C means failure and employment prospects are bleak. \"We know from our extensive work with young people that the support they so desperately need when they aren't coping is grossly lacking but we also know from services that they are under huge funding pressures and are overwhelmed with demand.\" Health minister Norman Lamb said the government was \"placing an unprecedented emphasis on mental health\", particularly for children and young people. \"More than a third of children and young people now live in an area where children and adolescent mental health services have been transformed. \"We are investing \u00a354m into improving access to mental health treatments for children and young people.\"",

Media playback is not supported on this device The 30-year-old London 2012 gold medallist recorded 8.18m in his final jump to win ahead of Uruguay's Emiliano Lasa (7.96m). Holly Bradshaw set a new British women's pole vault record of 4.80m. There was a minute's silence before the event for the victims of Monday's attack in the city. Twenty-two people were killed and another 116 were injured by a suicide bomber as the crowd left a performance by US singer Ariana Grande at the Manchester Arena. The Great City Games, which is staged in the city centre, was given the go-ahead by council and police on Tuesday. The Great Manchester Run will also go ahead this Sunday and will be covered on BBC One from 12:30-14:30 BST. Friday's competition was the first major event in Manchester since the attack and drew thousands to a sunny Deansgate and Albert Square. The latter, which three days ago hosted a vigil for those who lost their lives in the attack, was the scene for a stellar display from Rutherford. His jump of 8.08m in his second attempt had already ensured victory before his final effort, which saw him extend his lead further. \"It's been absolutely amazing to get you all out here in support of us,\" said Rutherford afterwards. \"It's been an incredibly difficult week for everybody and I'm so pleased we can come here and give you something to smile about and enjoy. \"Manchester is one of my favourite cities in the world to go to. I love it for the football and I love it for all you guys getting behind us in sport. \"It truly is a special place.\" Media playback is not supported on this device It was a superb evening for Bradshaw, who beat her own personal best before going on to surpass her own British record in the pole vault. Starting at 4.50m, the 25-year-old from Preston cleared at the third attempt to ensure victory over her rivals, with fellow Britons Rachel Gibbons and Sally Peake and Belgium's Chloe Henry all failing to go higher than 4m. She then went on to surpass the mark of 4.71m she set in 2012 before also clearing 4.80m at the first attempt. \"It was a bit nerve-wracking at the start,\" Bradshaw, who was sixth at London 2012 and fifth four years later in Rio, told BBC Sport. \"But there were great conditions. Once I got in the zone, to jump 4.72 and then 4.80 I am really chuffed. \"Training has been going great. I am in the best shape I have ever been in. I just need to stay healthy, keep sharp and build momentum going into the majors.\" Media playback is not supported on this device Jonnie Peacock eased to victory in the T44 men's 100m in 10.92 seconds, accelerating to pull well ahead of his three challengers. South Africa's Arnu Fourie was second (11.25secs), with Michail Seitis third (11.39) and Italy's Emanuele di Marino fourth (12.18). \"We had a massive shift on technical aspects last year and had just six months to get them right before the Olympics but we improved a lot,\" Peacock told BBC Sport. \"I still have a lot to improve. My first five metres today were terrible.\" Sophie Kamlish made it a British double in the event with victory in the T44 women's 100m, beating Dutch three-time Paralympic gold medallist Marlou van Rhijn by 0.02secs in a time of 13.24. On the specially laid track on Deansgate, Asha Philip pipped Australian Sally Pearson to the win the women's 100m in a time of 11.48secs. Pearson made up for that disappointment by winning the final race of the evening - the 100m hurdles - in 12.81secs. Another Briton, James Dasaolu, clocked 10.25 to take the men's 100m after 41-year-old Kim Collins, who claimed gold at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, pulled up with cramp. American Johnny Dutch, who was coaxed out of retirement last year, impressed in the men's 200m hurdles with a time of 22.48secs, comfortably beating a British trio led by Sebastian Rodger (22.89). There was a surprise result in the men's 150m as Greece's Lykourgos-Stefanos Tsakonas claimed a personal best of 15.04secs to see off the challenge of Britain's Harry Aikines-Aryeetey, who also ran a PB of 15.22.

        "article": "The founder of Kids Company has defended the charity's \"exceptional\" value, after a report revealed it received at least \u00a346m of public money. Funding given to the charity, which collapsed in August, included at least \u00a328m from the Department for Education, the National Audit Office said. It received the money despite warnings about its financial management. But founder Camila Batmanghelidjh said an \"extremely distorted picture\" of the charity was being painted. She said former staff and mentors at Kids Company were now \"too scared\" to defend it because of a \"media frenzy and biased reporting\". She added: \"The state gave Kids Company money to do the job it couldn't do. It wasn't doing the charity a favour.\" Evidence would have demonstrated Kids Company's \"exceptional clinical and financial value as well as its rigorous accountability\", had it not been \"lost\" by the Department for Education, Ms Batmanghelidjh said. But a Department for Education spokesman said: \"We do not recognise Camila's version of events.\" Prime Minister David Cameron said he thought it had been right to give Kids Company the chance to keep going, and that was why it had access to public money. The NAO found that Kids Company received public funding for at least 15 years, with at least \u00a342m provided in government grants, including \u00a328m from the Department for Education and its predecessors. It also received about \u00a32m from councils and \u00a32m from the National Lottery. The key findings of the report were: The NAO, an independent body which audits government departments, found that despite \"repeatedly expressed concerns\" from officials, the government \"continued to respond to the charity's requests for funding\". Its report said civil servants had noted that other organisations \"appeared to offer better value for money\" than Kids Company. It found \"a consistent pattern of behaviour\" of the charity writing to ministers to express fears of redundancies and the impact of service closures, while raising the same concerns in the media. This meant that from 2013 it did not have to compete for grants, the NAO found. Ashley McDougall, from the NAO, said it was not clear why government had continued to fund Kids Company \"year after year\" when concerns were known. 2002: Officials criticised Kids Company's record of financial management and said other similar organisations were more effective. 2003: Kids Company had not complied with conditions attached to a previous emergency grant, debts at the charity were mounting, and its long-term financial viability needed to be evaluated, officials said. 2008: Officials raised concerns Kids Company's dependency on government funding was being prolonged and the government could be accused of favouritism. 2013: Kids Company grants were significantly higher than those to similar charities, yet it had limited reserves and consistent cash flow difficulties, officials said. March 2015: Cash flow problems were persisting and officials were concerned that the charity would continue to rely on public funding. June 2015: Officials cast doubt on the financial figures produced by Kids Company, and said they had limited confidence in the charity's willingness or ability to change. They advised ministers not to provide emergency funds - but were overruled. What went wrong at Kids Company? BBC's Chris Cook: How ministers were 'bullied' Do Kids Company's sums add up? Former children's minister Tim Loughton said he warned the Department for Education against giving a \"very sizeable\" grant to Kids Company in 2012. But he said he was \"overruled\" by Downing Street after Ms Batmanghelidjh wrote a \"Dear David letter\" to Number 10. Asked if he had he personally approved a loan for the charity, Mr Cameron said: \"I'll have to look and see precisely the actual letter you're referring to, but my role in this has always been to try and help keep that organisation going because it was doing very good and important work.\" He said the government - and the last Labour government - had been \"confronted by difficult situations where this organisation doing this good work was finding it difficult to be financially viable\". Labour MP Meg Hillier, who chairs the Commons Public Accounts Committee, which will question officials on Monday, said it was \"unbelievable\" so much was given to the charity with \"little focus\" on its achievements. Speaking in the Commons, Labour MP Paul Flynn said: \"There is compelling evidence now that three prime ministers were unwittingly but directly involved in an enterprise that cost the tax payers many millions of pounds.\" Kids Company was founded in 1996 in south London.

Pavlina Pizova said she and Ondrej Petr began hiking the Routeburn track in Fiordland National Park on 26 July, but got lost in bad conditions. After one night in the open, Petr, 27, slipped in a steep ice slope and died, Ms Pizova told reporters. She said she spent the night with his body before moving on to find shelter. She then stayed in a hut for almost a month. Ms Pizova was found by a search team near Lake Mackenzie on Wednesday. Rescuers said she was \"ecstatic\" to be found and was in reasonable health. Rescuers were alerted after Czech Consul Vladka Kennett spotted \"a random Facebook post\" by concerned relatives of Ms Pizova at home in the Czech Republic. Ms Pizova was taken to hospital where she was interviewed by police, who described the case as \"very unusual\". She told police that she and Petr, who was also Czech, set out to hike the Routeburn track between Mount Aspiring and Fiordland National Parks. \"The conditions were extreme. We encountered heavy snowfall and low cloud which contributed to our enforced overnighting in the open,\" Ms Pizova told a press conference. \"In our attempt to reach the hut, the tragic accident happened.\" Ms Kennett said the hiker was unable to save her partner. \"Pavlina slipped behind him, and was unable to help him out, and that was it,\" Ms Kennett said. \"She stayed with him for the first night, beside him, because first of all she wanted to be with him, and she couldn't move any further due to the weather conditions.\" Petr's body has now been recovered by police and a coroner's inquiry launched. Ms Pizova then spent another night out in the open, Ms Kennett said, stuffing all of her things into her sleeping bag and rubbing her feet continuously to avoid frostbite and hypothermia. She later reached Lake Mackenzie Hut, 2km away, and broke in to the warden's quarters through a window. There she found food, firewood and supplies. She would stay in the small hut for nearly a month. Ms Pizova attempted twice to walk out from the hut but was discouraged by the poor state of her feet and the deep snow. She used fire ash to make a letter ``H'' in the snow to signal for help. \"As you can imagine the last month was very harrowing for me,\" she said. \"She is an extremely tough woman,\" Ms Kennett added. No search was launched initially as the couple had neither registered their hike with authorities nor were carrying emergency locator beacons. After being alerted to the Facebook post, police found the couple's car, apparently parked for some time at one end of their route, and used a search helicopter to help locate Ms Pizova. The Routeburn track usually takes a few days to complete. Local police Insp Olaf Jensen said it was \"very unusual for someone to be missing in the New Zealand bush for such a long period without it being reported\", the New Zealand Herald reported. \"I appreciate there are a number of unanswered questions, however, until we can piece together exactly what has happened we are unable to say anything further.\"",

Lauren Graham, who played Herrmann's on-screen daughter Lorelai Gilmore during the show's seven series, remembered the actor as the \"kindest, classiest, most talented man\" and said it was a \"devastating blow to lose him\". \"Ed Herrmann's combination of pure charisma plus his distinctive voice lit up any room he entered,\" she added. \"He had a gentlemanly manner, a wicked sense of humour, and a sharp wit. He was well-read, interesting, and just plain fun to be around.\" Kelly Bishop, who played his wife Emily Gilmore, said she was \"somewhat stunned\" by his death, having only found out he was ill a few weeks ago. \"I think everyone who knew or worked with Ed found him to be absolutely delightful,\" she said in a statement. \"Everything looks a little dim, as if the lights went down.\" The actor, who trained at London's Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, was singled out for praise when Entertainment Weekly picked Gilmore Girls as one of its \"new TV classics\" in 2009. Describing him as an \"on-screen pro\", it said he could \"advise, hector, and soothe with debonair slyness\". But his son, Rory, said his father's favourite role had been US President Franklin D Roosevelt, whom he played in the TV movies Eleanor and Franklin and Eleanor and Franklin: The Whitehouse Years in 1976 and 1977. The actor reprised the role in the 1982 movie musical Annie, and provided the voice for FDR in Ken Burns' documentary series The Roosevelts: An Intimate History, last year. Herrmann also starred in Joel Schumacher's teen vampire film, The Lost Boys, alongside Kiefer Sutherland, where he played Max; and won a primetime Emmy in 1999 for his guest role in the Boston-based legal series The Practice. His Broadway credits included the original run of Love Letters in 1989, The Deep Blue Sea with Blythe Danner in 1998 and George Bernard Shaw's Mrs Warren's Profession, for which he won a Tony Award in 1976. He often appeared on the big screen in major films including The Wolf of Wall Street, The Aviator and Reds, and recently appeared on shows such as Grey's Anatomy, How I Met Your Mother and The Good Wife. His manager Robbie Kass said in a statement: \"Besides being an accomplished actor, [Herrmann] was also a true gentleman and a scholar, as well as being incredibly kind and decent man.

For me, I was even more shocked because I haven't been doing too much discus this year as I have been focusing on the shot put for Rio, but I know there is a lot more in the tank. \"I know I can throw a long way but the fact that I am surprised myself is very exciting.\" Hermitage followed up her T37 400m success with another superb performance, clocking 27.21 to beat France's Marie-Francois Elie's 28.35 set at the 2013 Worlds in Lyon. \"I'm just so happy to get the world record and win a second European gold medal,\" she said. \"The 400m on Monday was very pressurised but the 200m isn't a Rio event for me, however it is something I still really enjoy. I went into it a lot calmer and more relaxed so maybe that helped.\" Devine was overhauled late on in his race by Poland's Lucasz Wietecki but the 24-year-old Liverpudlian, who only returned to training in December, had mixed feelings on his comeback. \"It is obviously great to win a medal again but I'm a little disappointed that I wasn't strong enough to hold on for the gold,\" he said. \"I've only only raced three times since London so it is bound to take some time to get race fit. Give me a couple of months and I'll be able to hold them off. \"There have been so many times when I have wanted to quit but my mum and dad told me I couldn't because I had too much talent and was too good to give in.\"",

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Moscow was tired of the accusations. He said a report released by US intelligence agencies detailing the allegations was groundless. It is the first official reaction from Russia since President-elect Donald Trump received the report on Friday. The unclassified report contains allegations that Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered the hacking of Democratic Party emails to damage Donald Trump's Democrat rival, Hillary Clinton, and influence the election. When presidents and spies fall out Can US election hack be traced to Russia? Does Trump need a daily briefing? What can Trump's tweets tell us? In his comments on Monday, Mr Peskov said Russia \"categorically denied that Moscow had been involved in any hacking attacks\". \"Groundless accusations which are not supported by anything are being rehearsed in an amateurish, unprofessional way. We don't know what information they are actually relying on.\" The claims amounted to a \"witch-hunt\", he added. Read more on the report here Mr Trump used the same \"witch-hunt\" term last week in a New York Times interview to disparage the hacking claims, which he has repeatedly rejected since winning the presidential election in November. But his incoming chief of staff, Reince Priebus, told Fox News Sunday that the president-elect had accepted the findings of the report, which was presented to him by intelligence chiefs on Friday. \"He's not denying that entities in Russia were behind this particular campaign,\" Mr Priebus added. He did not clarify whether Mr Trump believed the report's assertion that Russian President Vladimir Putin had directly ordered the hack. Mr Trump described his meeting on Friday with National Intelligence Director James Clapper, CIA Director John Brennan and FBI Director James Comey as \"constructive\" and said he would ask, within 90 days of taking office, for a plan on how to stop cyber attacks. But he declined to single out Russia, saying it was one of several countries, outside groups and people who \"are consistently trying to break through the cyber infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations including the Democrat(ic) National Committee\". With less than two weeks until his inauguration, Mr Trump is under increasing pressure from both Democrats and Republicans to respond to the allegations. President Obama has already expelled 35 Russian diplomats from US soil over the hacking. Russia said it would not reciprocate.",

Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe - a charity worker accused of security offences - was detained while trying to leave the country with her baby daughter after visiting relatives in April 2016. Her family denies she broke any laws. Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, who is from London, said his wife's detention was a \"stain\" on Iran. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 38, who works for the charity the Thomson Reuters Foundation, has been detained in Iran since her arrest last year. The couple's two-year-old daughter has remained in Iran after the government confiscated her passport, and is being looked after by her grandparents. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's family said in September that a Revolutionary Court had handed down the five-year term. She was accused of allegedly plotting to topple the government in Tehran, but the official charges against her were not made public. According to Mr Ratcliffe, his wife's appeal was dismissed in a secret hearing of an Iranian Revolutionary Court on 4 January but only announced on 22 January. In a statement, her husband said the precise charges against her remain secret, but that two new accusations were made at her appeal. One was that she had been head of recruitment for the BBC's Farsi service when it was launched in 2009. Her family say she worked on a BBC training project for youth in Afghanistan and Iran, but never worked for BBC Farsi. The other charge was that she was married to a British spy. Mr Ratcliffe is an accountant. Monique Villa, chief executive of Thomson Reuters Foundation said she is \"outraged by this new mockery of justice\", and reiterated Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe never worked for BBC Farsi and that her husband \"is not a spy but a reputable accountant\". \"I am fully convinced of Nazanin's innocence,\" she added. Francesca Unsworth, BBC World Service Group director, said Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had briefly worked for charity BBC Media Action in a \"junior administrative capacity\" but had never worked for BBC Persian. \"In any case, to suggest that being employed by BBC Persian is tantamount to 'acting against national security' is patently ludicrous,\" Ms Unsworth added. Mr Ratcliffe said: \"The lack of justice in Nazanin's case continues to be a stain on Iran. The continued attempt to frame Nazanin behind secrets and lies brings shame. \"It is a needless waste of a mother and child's life for their own political bargains and economic interests.\" Iran does not recognize dual nationalities, meaning those detained cannot receive consular assistance. Since her imprisonment, her family have campaigned on her behalf, highlighting her deteriorating health while in jail and her anguish at her separation from her daughter.",

        "article": "Pro-Russia activists have stormed several official buildings in the eastern Ukrainian city of Luhansk. They seized the regional government's headquarters and prosecutor's office before opening fire with automatic weapons at the main police station. Interim President Olexander Turchynov criticised local police for their \"inaction\" and \"criminal treachery\". The US accused Russia of seeking to \"change the security landscape\" of Eastern and Central Europe. By David SternBBC News, Kiev The pro-Russian gunmen in Ukraine's east seem to be following a strategy of constant expansion and pressure on the Kiev government. Hardly a day goes by without another incident. Just recently, official buildings in Kostyantynivka have been taken over, Western military monitors detained, peaceful demonstrators in Donetsk attacked, and now the regional administration building in Luhansk has been seized. It is difficult to say what their ultimate goal is. Perhaps it is to keep government officials in Kiev on the defensive, forcing them to put out a number of fires at once, while others pop up throughout the region. Or else it is simply to keep the situation unstable, in order to prevent the presidential election scheduled to take place on 25 May. Or it could be just the opposite, as many in Kiev and throughout the country fear: to provoke the Ukrainians into a full crackdown, which would in turn spark a Russian invasion. The militants have called on Moscow to intervene on more than one occasion. In a speech at the Atlantic Council in Washington, Secretary of State John Kerry told the Kremlin to \"leave Ukraine in peace\" and warned: \"Nato territory is inviolable we will defend every single inch of it.\" In other developments on Tuesday: Moscow has said it has no intention of invading eastern Ukraine, where pro-Russia activists have seized government buildings in more than a dozen towns and cities. Until now, only the local office of the State Security Service (SBU) in Luhansk, a city of 465,000 people less than 30km (20 miles) from the Russian border, had been targeted. But on Tuesday afternoon, hundreds of people shouting \"Russia, Russia\" gathered outside the headquarters of the regional government to demand a referendum on greater autonomy. A group of men armed with sticks and metal bars broke into the building. They pulled down the Ukrainian flag flying from the roof and replaced it with a Russian tricolour and the flag of Donetsk People's Republic. Crowds of pro-Russia activists then overran the building housing the prosecutor's office before attacking the headquarters of the interior ministry's police force. Hours later, an AFP news agency journalist reported that officers had abandoned the police station and been taken away in buses, as an angry crowd shouted at them to \"Go home\". Activists also went into a regional television station, but decided not to take it over after they were allowed to make a live broadcast. Following the takeovers, President Turchynov demanded the dismissal of the police chiefs in Luhansk and the other eastern city of Donetsk. \"The overwhelming majority of law enforcement bodies in the east are incapable of fulfilling their duty to defend our citizens,\" he said. Pro-Russia activists control much of the neighbouring Donetsk region. Sanctions By Daniel SandfordBBC News, Moscow Sanctions screw is tightened Eastern Ukraine, which has a large Russian-speaking population, was a stronghold for former President Yanukovych before he was overthrown by protesters in February. The interim government has rejected the pro-Russian activists' demands for greater autonomy, fearing they could lead to the break-up of the country or more regions being annexed by Russia, as happened with Crimea last month. Pro-Russian activists continue to detain some 40 people, including seven military observers linked to the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) seized last week. On Tuesday evening, the self-styled \"mayor\" of the town of Sloviansk, where the observers are being held, said \"good progress\" had been made at talks with OSCE representatives. Vyacheslav Ponomaryov had earlier warned that they would only be released if the EU dropped its sanctions against separatist leaders. Earlier, the EU published a fresh list of 15 individuals facing travel bans and asset freezes. It included the chief of the Russian General Staff, the head of Russian military intelligence, and a Russian deputy prime minister, as well as separatist leaders in Crimea, Luhansk and Donetsk. On Monday, the US announced sanctions against seven individuals and 17 companies it said were linked to President Putin's \"inner circle\". President Putin warned that new sanctions might have an impact on the operations of Western companies in Russia. \"If this continues, we will of course have to think about how they work in the Russian Federation, including in key sectors of the Russian economy such as energy,\" he said, adding that there were \"neither Russian instructors, nor special units, nor troops\" in Ukraine. US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said the sanctions, first imposed by Washington and Brussels after Crimea was annexed, had so far caused \"a quite substantial deterioration in Russia's already weak economy\".",

Ashton dived over with his signature swallow celebration in a dominant second half from the home side, where Shalk Brits, Brad Barritt and Billy Vunipola also crossed. That added to first-half tries by Jamie George, Alex Goode and Sean Maitland. Bath could only manage a single try through Anthony Watson as they suffered their third straight defeat. Having been competitive in the opening 40 minutes, Bath were overwhelmed in the second period and now sit three points behind fourth-placed Leicester, whom they meet in two weeks' time at Twickenham. Saracens kept up their pursuit of a home semi-final and now lie just a point behind Exeter in second. After George had driven over a rolling maul inside four minutes, Goode began and finished the try of the afternoon. He freed Ashton, whose inside break sent Saracens into the 22, the move flowed towards the left-hand touchline and Goode dived over in the corner. Ashton, who is joining Toulon in the summer, scored his two tries in the final 10 minutes as the Bath defence tired. Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall: \"Chris was really good, you could see what a clever rugby player he is. He did a lot of things in the game that people don't give him credit for in terms of the attacking kicks used and where he pops up. \"Sean Maitland on our other wing was also good and the two of them gave performances that Warren Gatland might be interested in. \"It was a really good performance. It was a bit mixed in the first 50 minutes - we started well into a strong wind. \"The bench came on and did a fantastic job and we just took our game to a different level in that last half hour. We are going to need that against Glasgow.\" Bath director of rugby Todd Blackadder: \"That was really disappointing and it's a low, but I believe we're a better team than that, we just need to show it. \"I think we're mentally strong enough, but you might look at the second half and say no at times. It didn't look like we had a lot of fight when we were going backwards. \"The answers are always within the room.

Lon Snowden told journalists in Moscow he felt \"extreme gratitude that my son is safe and secure and he's free\". He later met his son, local media say. Edward Snowden was granted asylum in Russia in August after weeks spent in a transit zone at Moscow airport when the US revoked his travel documents. The 30-year-old leaked many thousands of US intelligence documents. The information, published in The Guardian and Washington Post newspapers, revealed extensive internet and phone surveillance by both US and British intelligence. In the US, Edward Snowden faces charges of theft of government property, unauthorised communication of national defence information and wilful communication of classified intelligence. Each of the charges carries a maximum 10-year prison sentence. Meanwhile, Edward Snowden met four former US security officials in Russia late on Wednesday, it has emerged. The officials - who now campaign against what they describe as the misuse of state secrecy - said they had presented Mr Snowden with the Sam Adams Associates for Integrity in Intelligence award. The award is given annually by a group of retired CIA officers. The officials told Russian media Mr Snowden had no regrets about leaking the classified files and was convinced he had done the right thing. \"He's remarkably centred,\" ex-FBI agent Coleen Rowley told state-funded RT television. 'Legal options' Lon Snowden, arriving at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport on Thursday, was met by his son's Russian lawyer, Anatoly Kucherena. \"I'm here to learn more about my son's situation,\" Mr Snowden told reporters. \"My hope is to learn more about his circumstances and his health and to discuss legal options.\" \"If the opportunity presents itself, I certainly hope that I have the opportunity to see my son,\" he said in televised remarks. \"I'm not sure that my son will be returning to the US. That's his decision, he's an adult.\" Lon Snowden later visited his son, but the place and time of the meeting \"are not being been revealed for security reasons\", said Russia's state-run TV channels Rossiya 24 and Channel One. Lon Snowden has in the past praised his son for speaking \"the truth\" and making great sacrifices, and has spoken of his concern that he would not face a fair trial if he returned to the US. Edward Snowden accessed many of the documents while working for the defence contractor Booz Allen Hamilton in Hawaii, where he had been living with his girlfriend. As the revelations became public, Mr Snowden fled to Hong Kong where, with his consent, The Guardian revealed his identity in June. To escape US attempts to extradite him, Mr Snowden moved on to Russia where he remained in the transit zone of Sheremetyevo airport until Russia granted him asylum. Russia's move added to already tense relations with the US. Washington cancelled a bilateral summit in September.",

Peers were due to resume line-by-line scrutiny on 9 February but that has now been put back until 22 February. The Scottish government wants a deal concluded by 12 February to allow time for it to be examined at Holyrood. Scottish Secretary David Mundell has informed Holyrood's Devolution Committee of the delay. The negotiations on the fiscal framework - the financial arrangements underpinning the transfer of new powers to the Scottish Parliament - have proved both protracted and complicated. The Scottish government has said there is still \"some distance to go\" before a deal can be agreed and threatened to veto any formula that was \"unfair to Scotland\". First Minister Nicola Sturgeon warned recently that Scotland stood to lose billions of pounds over the next few years under the Treasury's current proposals. Talks between the two governments are due to resume in Edinburgh on Monday. In a letter to Holyrood's Devolution Committee, Scottish Secretary David Mundell said: \"The fiscal framework talks are continuing, and I am optimistic about the process. I am doing everything I can to secure an agreement which is durable and fair to taxpayers in Scotland and the rest of the UK. \"All through the process we have made time for these issues to be properly considered and discussed, and that remains the case. \"I want to ensure both the Scottish Parliament and the House of Lords have as much information as possible for their consideration. It has been agreed, therefore, that the next parliamentary stage of the Scotland Bill will be rescheduled. \"This will allow more time for negotiations between the Scottish and UK Governments to progress. I am confident both parliaments will have the opportunity to properly consider the Scotland Bill and the fiscal framework before the Scottish Parliament's dissolution on March 23.\" Deputy First Minister John Swinney responded to Mr Mundell's letter, promising the Scottish government would do \"all we can\" to secure an agreement. But he added: \"We will not sign up to any proposed agreement which short changes Scotland by locking in long-term cuts to our budget. \"We are working to a deadline of February 12th for talks to be concluded because the Scottish Parliament requested this, as members need time to properly scrutinise and vote on an agreed fiscal framework package before it is dissolved next month ahead of May's election - but we will give all the time possible to secure a deal.\" Earlier the Treasury minister negotiating on behalf of the UK government said he was \"confident\" a deal would be reached. Greg Hands said he had cleared his diary for a full day of talks in Edinburgh next Monday and he remained \"upbeat\" that an agreement would be struck. What is the fiscal framework? He told the Commons Scottish Affairs Committee: \"I'm ready to deal. I'm off to Edinburgh on Monday and I remain upbeat on that possibility. \"The UK government remains committed to getting that deal.\" An agreement would set out how Scotland's annual block grant from the Treasury will be adjusted to take account of the new tax powers. Mr Hands insisted the proposals will provide \"huge new opportunities\" for the Scottish government to grow the economy. The deal must be \"fair to taxpayers in Scotland and fair to taxpayers in the rest of the UK\", he told the committee. Mr Hands said: \"Neither Scotland nor the rest of the UK should be better or worse off as result of the initial act of devolution. \"Thereafter, the Scottish government should bear the fruit of good policy decisions and the consequences of poor policy decisions.\" The committee chairman, SNP MP Pete Wishart, warned that Mr Hands and Scottish Finance Secretary John Swinney appeared to have \"very different perspectives\" on the long-running negotiations. \"There does seem to be some distance to go in terms of getting an agreement on this,\" Mr Wishart said. Scottish Labour had earlier called for the 12 February deadline to be abandoned, and said neither side should walk away until a deal is reached. The party has criticised a lack of transparency in negotiations and called on minutes of meetings to be published.

        "article": "The criminal courts charge should be scrapped by ministers, a parliamentary committee has said, as it raised \"grave misgivings\" about the fee's benefits. Since April, convicted criminals in England and Wales have had to pay a charge of between \u00a3150 and \u00a31,200 towards the cost of their case. MPs on the justice select committee said the charge, which is not means-tested, created \"serious problems\" and was often \"grossly disproportionate\". Ministers said it was under review. The fee is paid on top of fines, compensation orders and defendants' own legal charges, and is higher for those convicted after pleading not guilty. It is set according to the type of case, with the minimum charge for magistrates' courts and the maximum level for crown court cases. In March, the then Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said the fee would ensure that criminals \"pay their way\". But chairman of the cross-party committee Bob Neill said: \"The evidence we have received has prompted grave misgivings about the operation of the charge, and whether, as currently framed, it is compatible with the principles of justice.\" He added that \"in many cases it is grossly disproportionate\" and created \"perverse incentives - not only for defendants to plead guilty but for sentencers to reduce awards of compensation and prosecution costs\". The committee's report said the lack of discretion for judges and magistrates on the level of the charge was creating \"unacceptable consequences within the criminal justice system\". It cited the case of a woman who had admitted stealing a four-pack of Mars Bars worth 75p, saying she \"had not eaten in days\" after her benefits were sanctioned. She was ordered to pay a \u00a3150 criminal courts charge on top of her \u00a373 fine, \u00a385 costs, a \u00a320 victim surcharge and 75p compensation. The committee also said it was \"highly sceptical\" of government claims that the charges could deliver a net revenue of \u00a380m to \u00a3160m a year by 2023 - with an annual cost of collection of about \u00a320m and a \u00a35m bill for imprisoning defaulters. The Ministry of Justice said the concerns were noted and the operation of the fee was being kept under review. It comes after Justice Secretary Michael Gove told Parliament earlier this month that the charge was generating revenue and helping to \"ensure that the taxpayer is not the first port of call for supporting the way in which our courts operate\". But Frances Crook, chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said the criminal courts charge was \"unrealistic and unjust\" and called on the Ministry of Justice to \"suspend this policy immediately\". \"The innocent have been put under pressure to plead guilty, and ordering indigent people to pay money they simply do not have is never going to work,\" she said.",

Mr de Mistura said the agenda would include the formation of a transitional administration and elections. But it is not clear who will attend the indirect talks in Geneva, with some opposition leaders yet to confirm. On the ground in Syria, a partial truce that began 12 days ago has considerably reduced the intensity of the fighting. Mr de Mistura said the cessation of hostilities was holding \"by and large\" and was open-ended as far as the UN was concerned. The first round of talks on a political solution to the conflict in Syria was suspended last month while still in the \"preparatory\" phase, with both sides blaming each other. It came as government forces, backed by Russian air strikes, launched a major offensive on opposition-controlled areas around the northern city of Aleppo. The government succeeded in cutting a key rebel supply route from Turkey to Aleppo before the US and Russia brokered the cessation of hostilities agreement, which does not include the jihadist groups Islamic State (IS) and al-Nusra Front. At a news conference in Geneva on Wednesday, Mr de Mistura welcomed what he described as \"a sustained reduction of violence\". \"Incidents are taking place, no question and they are. I'm expecting even worse incidents to take place, probably caused by spoilers,\" he added. \"The secret will be whether the sides are in a position, as so far touch wood has been the case, [to] contain them, make them not become an unravelling of what has been after five years quite a change... for the life of every Syrian.\" Mr de Mistura said he expected informal discussions to begin at hotels across Geneva immediately, but that formal talks would not resume until Monday. He added that they would once again be indirect \"proximity\" talks, with representatives of the warring parties located in separate rooms, and would last only 10 days before pausing for a week. \"We believe that having a timetable and a time limit is healthy for everyone so that we don't think that we can go on\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 for two weeks hoping to get into substance - we go seriously into substance as soon as we can.\" The BBC's Imogen Foulkes in Geneva says the focus of the talks will be a transitional government, a new constitution, and elections. Humanitarian access and ceasefire violations will not be on the agenda. The UN has set up two taskforces to deal with those issues, and clearly wants the opposition and government representatives to concentrate on a political settlement, our correspondent adds. UN aid agencies say good progress has been made getting supplies to besieged areas, with almost 240,000 people reached, most of whom received nothing in the last year. But our correspondent says it remains unclear exactly who will arrive in Geneva on Monday, with some opposition leaders suggesting they have not yet decided whether to attend. Meanwhile, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Raad Al Hussein told the BBC that the international system had failed Syria. \"We've seen in this conflict... almost every conceivable war crime allegedly being committed, in addition to crimes against humanity,\" he said. \"What does it say to us? It says... that the international system is incapable of addressing this sort of conflict. So future 'Syrias' - we have no algorithm, no formula, for how we address these conflicts. And it doesn't bode well for the 21st Century, of course,\" he added.",

        "article": "Russia is not the only country with systemic doping problems, says UK Athletics chairman Ed Warner. Media playback is not supported on this device A World Anti-Doping Agency commission report has accused Russia of running a \"state-sponsored\" doping programme. And Warner said he feels sports other than athletics have reason to be concerned at how Russian sport is run. \"This iceberg spreads in two different directions,\" he said. \"I suspect there are probably four, five or six nations that athletics has a problem with.\" Commission chairman Dick Pound said Russia's athletics federation, Araf, should be banned from the Rio 2016 Olympics. Warner told BBC Radio 5 live: \"Every other international sport today should be looking at Russian sport and looking at whether the men and women who compete in their events are clean.\" \"They do not have robust anti-doping regimes. They are asleep on the job - and they have to be rooted out.\" Wada's independent commission, which examined allegations of doping, cover-ups and extortion in Russian athletics, also implicated the International Association of Athletics' Federations. The IAAF's former president Lamine Diack has been provisionally suspended by the International Olympic Committee, who have also asked the IAAF to start disciplinary action against the athletes named in the report. Araf has been told to respond to the report by Friday and Russia have defended their position. Acting head of Russia Athletics Federation, Vadim Zelichenok, said: \"There is an element of a political hit job here because quite a few things were described in the report in a biased way.\" Russia's sports ministry has said it will work more closely with Wada, Igor Zagorskiy, deputy director of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency, Rusada, told the BBC: \"There is always room for improvement. \"We are on that track and we've been on that track together with Wada. We will continue this work on this.\" Warner says the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), must be restructured to combat the problem. He revealed that he had spoken to IAAF president Lord Coe since Monday's publication of Wada's independent commission, which examined allegations of doping, cover-ups and extortion in Russian athletics, and also implicated the IAAF. The 323-page report said that \"acceptance of cheating at all levels is widespread\" in Russia and suggested that neither Araf, Rusada, nor the Russian Federation can be considered anti-doping code-compliant. The report also said the London 2012 Olympics were \"sabotaged\" by \"widespread inaction\" against athletes with suspicious doping profiles; accuses Moscow laboratory director Grigory Rodchenko of asking for and accepting bribes and intentionally destroying samples he was told to keep; and recommends that five Russian athletes and five coaches should be given lifetime doping bans. Media playback is not supported on this device Pound, who chaired the Wada investigation, said the situation was \"worse than we thought\", adding that \"it may be a residue of the old Soviet Union system\". Warner backed the recommendation to suspend Russia from competition \"until they put their house in order\", adding: \"If you punish one or two innocent Russian athletes for the greater good of the sport, that is a moral dilemma I am willing to grasp.\" He also suggested that Russia is unlikely to be the only country guilty of doping, saying that \"athletics has probably got some other nations to root out\". He added that while \"there are undoubtedly drugs cheats in many corners of athletics\", he believed systemic doping did not occur in nations in the Western world. During a special BBC Radio 5 live programme examining the independent report, Britain's marathon world record holder Paula Radcliffe said: \"I don't think anyone is under the impression it's only Russia.\" On the same programme, former British sprinter Darren Campbell warned of \"darker days to come\". He said: \"This report was about Russia, and they need to be punished if this holds up, but we'll lose sight on the bigger issues if we focus on Russia. It's about cleaning everything out. \"There's people talking about testing out in Kenya and Jamaica. We can't have rumours anymore. \"We need to understand how the Russians got away with it. How did this happen yet nobody knew? \"No matter how dark and depressing it gets, change has to happen now.\" Coe, elected IAAF president in August, described the Wada report as \"alarming\" and has said he will seek urgent approval from members to consider sanctions against the Russian federation. The report found evidence of multiple rules breaches by IAAF officials and found the governing body to be \"inexplicably lax in following up suspicious blood (and other) profiles\". Media playback is not supported on this device It has also been criticised for its handling of the allegations, with Coe himself describing claims about suspicious blood profiles involving some athletes as \"a declaration of war on my sport\" in August. On Monday, Coe said that \"if there are failings in our governance or our anti-doping programme I will fix them\". But Warner says Coe needs to restructure the IAAF in order for it to effectively tackle the problem. \"This cannot be a one-man crusade,\" Warner told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \"He needs to ensure there is a bench around him at the IAAF who dramatically improve the operation. \"We all know, and he has already said, he needs to go out and hire a good chief executive. \"It needs more than that. He also possibly needs a chairman under him so he can take the lead of the elected council and be the ambassador for the sport and have full-time professional staff, possibly from outside sport, from elsewhere in business, who can get a grip on the organisation.\"",

        "article": "A Wada report on the anti-doping methods employed at Rio 2016 has highlighted \"serious failings\". The World Anti-Doping Agency said many athletes who had been targeted for testing \"simply could not be found\". It added that, on some days, \"up to 50% of tests were aborted\". Its 55-page Independent Observers report found that, of the 11,470 athletes, 4,125 had no record of any testing in 2016, of whom 1,913 were competing in 10 \"higher-risk sports\". It also said: The International Olympic Committee (IOC) is ultimately responsible for delivering the anti-doping programme for the Olympic Games. Wada mentioned several \"failings\" which led to inadequate support for the chaperones employed to notify athletes of testing. It said that on several occasions more than half of these failed to turn up, or turned up very late. It said they were \"disincentivised\" because of a lack of training, poor travel arrangements, and the fact many could not speak English. It said that, for \"the majority of times\" the 'no-notice' nature of testing was \"obviously compromised\" because chaperones did not know where athletes were and had to ask their team-mates where they were. In one of its recommendations, it said: \"Untrained and inexperienced chaperones should not be working at the Games. \"It undermines respect and trust among athletes in the anti-doping program, and provides opportunities for experienced and unscrupulous athletes who would want to abuse the system to manipulate the doping control process.\" Wada did praise improvements made to Rio's anti-doping laboratory, however. The organisation had suspended the lab just six weeks before the Games opened, because it failed to comply with international standards. But Wada said it had been \"superbly equipped\", and was \"operated very securely and generally very efficiently\". It said it now represents an \"outstanding legacy from the Games for the anti-doping movement in South America\". A statement on the IOC's website quoted Dr Richard Budgett, the IOC's medical and scientific director, saying the report \"shows that it was a successful Olympic Games with a successful anti-doping programme\". He added that the integrity of the programme had been \"ensured despite some challenges\". Speaking to BBC Radio 5 live, Sir Craig Reedie, president of Wada, said that the logistical problems highlighted were disappointing. \"What was a real problem was the sample collection,\" he said, \"and there were number of major issues in Brazil, one was the lack of money and the other lack of manpower and some of that worked its way through to the sample collection process. \"In general the integrity of the process was not undermined according to the report.\" Reedie said the doping programme had been well planned but let down by unforeseen circumstances. \"If you assume that you have a certain number of people to do the work and 50% don't turn up you've got a problem,\" he said. BBC sports editor Dan Roan In the midst of the Russian doping scandal, and the revelation that both London 2012 and Sochi 2014 were sabotaged by state-sponsored cheating, it was crucial that the authorities did as much as possible to show they were keeping Rio 2016 clean. Instead, this damning report is another shattering blow to the credibility of anti-doping and the Olympic movement's integrity, showing how organisational chaos blighted the Games' drugs-testing programme. After it refused demands to ban Russia's entire team from the Olympics, do not be surprised if there are now calls for the IOC itself to be declared Wada non-compliant. And there could also be tough questions for the UK Anti-Doping agency, which acted as the secretariat for a pre-Rio anti-doping taskforce.",

Thousands of patients, or their families, will be able to apply to the \u00a3380m pot from next month. Those diagnosed after July 2012 and who cannot sue former employers as they have gone bust or insurance details have disappeared will be eligible. Ministers said the move ended \"years of injustice\". Mesothelioma can take decades to develop, but when symptoms emerge it progresses rapidly. Most die within three years of being diagnosed. Around 2,000 people are diagnosed each year, and the numbers are set to increase over the next 30 years, with an estimated death toll of between 56,000 and 63,000, according to the Department for Work and Pensions. The cancer is most prevalent among those who worked in industries with heavy exposure to asbestos up to the 1980s, including construction, shipbuilding, engineering and power generation. Until now, victims and their families have been able to claim damages under two pieces of legislation but the sums paid have not generally exceeded \u00a320,000. The new fund will entitle UK claimants to 80% of the average settlement paid out in civil actions relating to mesothelioma, meaning payments will range from \u00a3115,000 to \u00a3123,000. On top of the payment, the fund will pay out \u00a37,000 towards legal costs. The Mesothelioma Act was passed in January and allowed the creation of the compensation pot, funded by the insurance industry. Those diagnosed before the scheme was first announced, on 25 July 2012, will not be eligible. Claimants will have to demonstrate that they were negligently exposed to asbestos at work and are unable to claim compensation because they cannot track down a liable employer or insurer. Work and Pensions Minister Mike Penning said: \"This will end years of injustice for mesothelioma victims and their families - who have had to endure this terrible disease with little hope of any compensation from the insurance industry. \"We have made it an absolute priority to bring in the scheme as soon as legislation will allow, so I am pleased to announce that victims will be able to apply for payments from next month.\" According to government calculations, around 3,500 patients or their dependants are likely to be eligible for support. Dr John Moore-Gillon, honorary medical adviser at the British Lung Foundation, said: \"Mesothelioma is a particularly devastating disease, killing over 2,400 people every year in the UK, most of whom were innocently exposed to asbestos in the work place. \"The government's announcement today is therefore a positive move for mesothelioma patients and their families, many of whom struggled to gain any compensation at all until recently. \"What we urgently need to see now is greater commitment to funding research into new treatments for mesothelioma.\" He added: \"Although compensation awards are very helpful, they don't change the fact that most people who develop mesothelioma will be dead in less than three years. \"Only research investment will change that - it is what patients and their families want, and with over 50,000 likely to die of the disease in the UK within the next 30 years, it is something we desperately need to prioritise.\"",

The Electoral Commission will decide whether to select Vote Leave, which Mr Johnson is backing or Grassroots Out, which has been endorsed by UKIP's Nigel Farage, as the official lead campaign. The winner will be able to spend up to \u00a37m on TV broadcasts and advertising. The Mayor of London suggested the two groups would unite after the decision. Relations between the two groups have been strained amid arguments over campaign strategies and personalities. Asked whether a merger was now on the cards, he told LBC Radio that the \"basic objective\" should be to have a single campaign and the rival groups were \"unified by the rightness of their arguments\". Vote Leave has been endorsed by Mr Johnson and the five Conservative Cabinet ministers who want to leave the EU. It also has the backing of a number of Labour Eurosceptics, including Gisela Stuart, and business figures. Grassroots Out, which was formed in January, is backed by senior UKIP figures as well as Conservative and Labour backbenchers such as Peter Bone and Kate Hoey. Speaking on his monthly LBC phone-in, Mr Johnson rejected suggestions that having two separate groups was holding back the Leave campaign and was being exploited by their opponents. \"I haven't noticed the other side making very much of this. Let's hold our fire and not get wrapped up in tiny issues about who is doing what on the Leave campaign. The thing that matters to me is getting the arguments out.\" Mr Johnson said he had spoken to the UKIP leader in recent weeks but his focus was on making the case to the British people. He added: \"The Electoral Commission have to work out which of the various groupings should carry the flag for Britain to take back control of its borders, take back control of a huge amount of money and forge new trading relationships around the world. \"I think it doesn't really matters too much who comes out on top in this one provided that we all get together and work to that end.\" Asked whether the decision would be a unifying moment for those backing EU exit, he replied \"of course it will\". The elections watchdog is expected to make its decision on which group will head the Leave campaign by the middle of April. It will judge each applicant's merits on the basis of a range of criteria, such as level of cross-party support, campaign tactics and organisational capacity. Whoever wins will get access to a grant of up to \u00a3600,000 and an overall spending limit of \u00a37m for media, mailshots and campaign organisation. Conservative MP Tom Pursglove, one of the co-founders of Grassroots Out, said the designation would be a \"watershed moment\", after which all Leave campaigners should \"put aside their differences, row in together and campaign as one\". He said he expected there to be dialogue between the two groups in the run-up to the official decision and Boris Johnson was \"spot on\" to argue the issue could not be allowed to become a distraction. \"There is just not the time to waste on bickering over the designation. We should be focused purely on leaving and winning this referendum.\" During the phone-in, Mr Johnson likened the Remain campaign's warnings about the risks of EU exit to fatalistic predictions about the Millennium Bug in 2000, saying talk of \"bank accounts being wiped\" and \"planes falling out of sky\" back then had been proved to be groundless. But he was challenged by the Labour MP Chuka Umunna, who accused him of using the campaign for his own political ends and \"inviting a media circus\" to his house last month to announce he was backing EU exit. \"What you need to understand is that this is not about you,\" Mr Umunna, who backs EU membership, said. \"It is about our city and our country...If anybody has been talking down our country, it is you. You denigrate our influence within the EU.\" Mr Johnson said that what made people sceptical about the EU was listening to politicians such as Mr Umunna \"droning on\" about the economic benefits of EU membership. \"This is about the prospects of the British people and their democracy,\" he insisted.",

Justice Secretary Michael Matheson has directed Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary in Scotland to investigate the actions of undercover officers. A review is ongoing in England and Wales, but the UK government has refused to extend it to Scotland, leaving Mr Matheson \"disappointed\". Victims of police spying had called for a Scottish inquiry to be set up. Holyrood's parties had been united in calling for an extension to the Pitchford Inquiry, which was set up in England and Wales to investigate allegations of misconduct by undercover officers. There are allegations that undercover Metropolitan Police officers had fathered children and caused miscarriages of justice, with claims of this activity extending to Scotland. Mark Kennedy, one of five officers known to have had relationships with women while undercover, is alleged to have infiltrated environmental groups ahead of the G8 summit at Gleneagles in 2005. Labour MSP Neil Findlay wrote directly to the policing minister, Brandon Lewis, but was told that it was \"not possible\" to extend the probe north of the border for \"a number of reasons\". Mr Matheson said he was \"firmly of the view\" that extending Pitchford would be the \"right thing to do\", and said he was \"disappointed\" with the UK government's refusal. He said: \"Given the operational extend of the units involved, the Scottish government believes that a single coherent inquiry is the most effective approach to provide a comprehensive investigation into these activities. \"However, in light of the Home Office's decision I have today directed Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary in Scotland to undertake a strategic review of undercover policing in Scotland.\" The justice secretary said this investigation would cover \"the extent and scale of undercover policing in Scotland\" dating back to 2000, as well as operations carried out by the Met Police units under investigation by Pitchford. He added: \"This review will also give independent assurance on the operation, procedures and safeguards in place by Police Scotland in relation to undercover policing.\" The Scottish Liberal Democrats welcomed the news, with Liam McArthur describing the probe as \"nothing less than required\". But Mr Findlay said it was \"minor progress\", calling it \"the police reviewing the police\" rather than the public inquiry he had called for. Victims who are participating in the Pitchford Inquiry had hit out at the decision not to extend it to Scotland, calling on Holyrood to order its own probe. A group of 17 victims issued a joint statement after Mr Lewis refused to extend the inquiry saying they were \"extremely frustrated\", saying it \"sets the inquiry up to fail before it even begins\". One of the group, Merrick Cork, added: \"It's outrageous that Theresa May thinks victims of police abuse deserve justice in England but not in Scotland. \"The police admit English officers committed human rights abuses against citizens on Scottish soil. It's absurd to expect public trust in police when abuses of power are swept under the carpet, and it's a snub to Scotland to say it doesn't matter there.\" Mr Lewis defended the limited scope of the inquiry, saying it was \"extensive and complex\" already, and needed to \"proceed swiftly\" without further delays. He added: \"The Home Office is confident the inquiry can both gain an understanding of historical failings and make recommendations to ensure unacceptable practices are not repeated without a need to consider every instance of undercover policing, wherever it was taken.\"",

        "article": "Photographs by Hugh Kinsella Cunningham. On 30 October 1974, a fight for the world heavyweight championship took place between George Foreman and Muhammad Ali in Kinshasa, Zaire. The bout between the then undefeated world heavyweight champion, Foreman, and his charismatic challenger, Ali, came to be known as \"The Rumble in the Jungle\". It is often called one of the greatest sporting events of the 20th Century. Ali eventually triumphed, knocking Foreman down in the eighth round and reclaiming the title from his significantly younger opponent. To mark the anniversary of Ali's death last year at the age of 74, photographer Hugh Kinsella Cunningham visited Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo (Zaire was renamed in 1997) to meet some of the boxers hoping to follow in Ali's footsteps. The fight was held in the Stade Tata Raphael. Although still surrounded by huge floodlights, it is in a state of disrepair, with only a few of the bulbs remaining. The stadium is home to a boxing club named in Ali's honour and the next generation of Congolese boxers still hold him in high regard. There are about 120 semi-regular attendees, including more than 40 who hope to box professionally. Sparring often takes place outside the stadium. Jorbelle Malewu sits outside the Muhammad Ali Memorial Club, where she has been training since 2010. Mainly inspired by Mike Tyson, she hopes to go on to box full-time as a professional. At present, she is unemployed. Another boxer at the club, Dina Yame, practises outside. For him, Ali is an icon. He complains that the government provides no money for the upkeep of the Stade facilities. There is a shortage of equipment, particularly gloves, and there is no boxing ring so sparring takes place freely around the compound. However, at fights spectators still sit in the same stands where roughly 60,000 people gathered to watch Ali defeat Foreman. Dorcas Lukamba has been boxing at the club for only three months, but she is aware of Ali's skill, having seen footage of his fights on DVD. Her coach, Carlos Kabongo, sits in his office underneath the stadium. Kabongo is a former boxing champion with three gold medals, who modelled his technique on the quick-footed fighting style of \"The Greatest\". He agrees with Yame about the lack of funding and dislikes the fact that he must charge youngsters a small fee to train within the stadium's historic premises. Now the director of the state-run television station, RTNC, Pierre Celeste Kabala was a 27-year-old radio journalist at the time of the fight. He remembers an atmosphere of pure elation in the city in anticipation of the American boxers' arrival. He too bemoans the lack of support structures and funding for today's Congolese boxers. The abandoned palace of the country's former leader, Mobutu Sese Seko, stands in Nsele, east of Kinshasa. Ali and Foreman spent much of their summer training here, becoming acclimatised to the tropical weather. The area is now overgrown and a glaring contrast with the nearby villages. The ruins are guarded by a handful of troops, but there is little of worth left to protect.",

Announcing the \"digital-only\" move, ESI Media said \"some redundancies among editorial employees\" would be made. But it said there would also be 25 new \"digital-content roles\". ESI has also confirmed it will sell its sister title, i newspaper, to Johnston Press, for an expected \u00c2\u00a324m, subject to approval from Johnston's shareholders. Evgeny Lebedev, ESI's owner, said: \"This decision preserves the Independent brand and allows us to continue to invest in the high-quality editorial content that is attracting more and more readers to our online platforms.\" The last print edition of the Independent will be published on Saturday 26 March, while the last Independent on Sunday will be on 20 March. By BBC media correspondent David Sillito It's easy to forget how groundbreaking the Independent was when it launched. It looked strikingly modern, it came with none of the partisan baggage of 1980s politics and in an era of bitter industrial disputes that blighted rivals such as the Times, it carved out a large readership. At its peak sales hit around 428,000 copies a day. Twenty-five years later, the number of copies being sold on a weekday in newsagents is rather closer to 28,000. This is an announcement that has been long awaited. The problem about switching to digital is that the big British print newspapers bring in revenues in hundreds of millions of pounds while even the best digital products make only tens of millions. The long decline in print readership has led to many declarations that print will be dead in a few years' time, but until a way is found to make more money out of digital, they will hang on to their print readers to the very end. ESI said the number of staff affected would be \"confirmed following a consultation period\". It said a \"significant number\" of staff would move to Johnston Press, which also own the Scotsman, the Yorkshire Post and some 250 other local and regional newspapers, as part of the sale of the i newspaper. The closure of the Independent's print editions will have \"no bearing on the status\" of the London Evening Standard - also owned by ESI - the company added. The Independent's editor Amol Rajan tweeted: \"Impossible to over-state how proud I am of the most dedicated, clever, industrious and brave staff in the history of Fleet St.\" The Independent was set up in 1986, and at its peak had a circulation of more than 400,000 copies, but December's figures showed it lagging far behind rival national newspapers. Russian billionaire Alexander Lebedev took control of the loss-making newspapers in 2010 when he bought Independent News for Media for \u00c2\u00a31. In 2014, his son Evgeny told the BBC the Independent could be sold if someone \"offers the right price\" - but he was \"not actively trying to sell it\". The first front page of the Independent was written by Mark Urban, now BBC Newsnight's diplomatic correspondent, a 25-year-old \"young stripling\". \"I went there because I was inspired\", he said. \"Their mission was to be the best. I thought it was a noble mission, and even if it all goes horribly wrong, it's worth a try.\" Many experienced journalists were among those who risked their careers and turned up \"with typewriters\" to launch the title, he said. \"For four weeks before launch dates, there were dummy runs every day. There was a very strong sense of purpose.\" Journalists from other publications and broadcasters paid tribute to the title and its staff. ITV political editor Robert Peston tweeted: \"Closure of @Independent as print title is heart-rending, terrible. Such an important paper in its day.\" The BBC's Andrew Marr, a former editor of the Independent, replied: \"Not in its day, Robert. Its day is now!\" Editor of the Independent on Sunday Lisa Markwell tweeted some of the paper's most memorable front pages, adding: \"My proudest professional achievement has been to preside over the brilliant, brave @IndyOnSunday team for 3 years.\" Stephen Glover, a co-founder of the Independent, said the paper was selling \"so few copies that it doesn't really make sense to go on printing it every day\". Speaking on Thursday - before the move was confirmed - he told BBC Newsnight: \"If it is true then I think it will be the first of many papers which stop their print editions and have another existence online.\" He said the Financial Times and the Guardian could also stop producing print editions \"within the next few years\", and in 10 to 15 years there would not be \"very many\" printed newspapers. Mr Glover said there was a \"longer question\" about whether online-only papers could support the same number of journalists and do the \"same sort of journalism\" as printed ones. The Times' media editor Beth Rigby said the industry had been in turmoil for many years, \"and now we're beginning to see the hard end of that\", adding that the Guardian and Telegraph were also facing major changes. Writing in the Guardian's website, professor of journalism Brian Cathcart predicted that all UK national newspapers would eventually go out of print. He added: \"No-one can say in what order it will happen, but it will happen to the most venerable titles, even to the top-selling Sun and Mail.\"",

        "article": "A pipeline system servicing up to 27 oil fields has been shut down after a leak on the Cormorant Alpha platform, north-east of Shetland. The fields affected, and another eight associated platforms, produce about 10% of the UK's oil output. Hydrocarbons were detected inside a leg of the Cormorant Alpha platform. Its operator, Taqa Bratani, has removed non-essential workers as a precaution and said the leak had been contained. Shutting down the platform affects the whole Brent pipeline system. The oil leak at Cormorant Alpha was discovered on Monday and non-essential crew were taken off the installation by helicopter. Taqa, also known as Abu Dhabi National Energy, said nothing had leaked into the sea and a technical team was investigating the source. Taqa said on Wednesday afternoon that it was \"currently evaluating plans to restore the throughput of an estimated 80,000 barrels per day in the Brent pipeline, excluding any Cormorant Alpha production.\" A spokesperson said: \"This action would occur after thorough technical assurance has established that it can be undertaken safely and without any increased risk.\" The BBC understands the rest of the Brent pipeline system can no longer operate because Cormorant Alpha, which is situated some 94 miles from Lerwick in Shetland, is a crucial pumping station. Eight other platforms have shut down with up to 27 North Sea fields affected. The Dunlin, Thistle, Northern Producer, Murchison, North Alwyn, Tern, Eider and North Cormorant platforms are also affected. Oil and Gas UK - the offshore industry body - said oil transported through the Brent pipeline system represented 10% of the UK's North Sea oil production. The amount of output affected is 90,000 barrels per day. It is not yet known what potential impact the shut down could have on petrol station prices. However Prof Alex Kemp, an oil economist at the University of Aberdeen, said the closure would have a limited impact on oil prices. He told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"What we have is an incident which impacts on the Brent pricing system which is used as a marker price for a lot of the world's production. \"If it continues one would expect a limited affect on the Brent price. \"But the Brent price doesn't just depend on Brent production, it depends on production from a lot of other fields. \"The effect should be limited because although the Brent price is the marker for a huge volume of oil in the world market, Brent production constitutes not all that big a proportion of the total.\" Enterprise Minister Fergus Ewing said: \"The Scottish government, including Marine Scotland, are monitoring this situation closely. \"No release of hydrocarbons has been reported and all non-essential staff on the platform have been safely removed. \"The Health and Safety Executive are investigating and will determine when the pipeline system can be opened again subject to any relevant safety measures being put in place.\" He said the loss \"does not impact security of supply at this time\".",

        "article": "The crisis in the steel industry could signal potential problems across other core Welsh industries, Plaid Cymru has warned. The party's economy spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth warned steel's troubles were a \"canary in the mine\", warning of deeper problems across a range of industries. These include basic metals, chemicals and wood. The Welsh government called on Westminster to address the impact of high energy prices on industry. The UK government has been asked to comment. Plaid said Gross Value Added (GVA) figures -  which measure the value of goods and services produced - show the so-called foundation industries in Wales have suffered a 39% decline in the five years to 2013. Mr ap Iorwerth urged the Welsh government to take action to help industries combat high energy costs. He said: \"Figures show that the threat to our economy runs far deeper than steel, but affects the range of industries that our economy is built upon. \"This includes the chemical industry, other metals, and wood products. Wales' foundation industries have witnessed a steep decline.\" He said UK government should also work with the EU to ensure maximum flexibility in use of procurement legislation so that they can better protect British industry. A Welsh government spokesman said: \"No-one has defended the steel industry more than the Welsh government. \"We have raised with the UK government over several years our concerns about the impact high UK energy prices are having on the competitiveness of our industries and again call on them to address this major problem. \"The economy minister has set-up an industry-led task group to gather examples of good procurement practices and to identify support other EU countries have provided to their steel industries.\" Pro Steel Engineering in Caldicot, Monmouthshire, is only three years old but has benefited from contracts in London, including the new Olympic Stadium roof in London for West Ham United and strengthening the Hammersmith fly-over. Director Richard Selby said: \"We're fortunate we're expanding and are hoping to start recruiting in a couple of months and we have a full order book. \"We've had the ability to stay agile and seizing the opportunities. \"But the foundation industries need a lot more support, particularly with the energy costs we have, and we need for the Welsh government and Westminster to get behind them to help them thrive.\" Economist Prof Calvin Jones, of Cardiff University, said the foundation industries were still important in terms of their high economic value and for being iconic. But he said Wales' growth areas had been in retail, hotels, back-office financial services and the public sector. \"We have to think about how they will fulfil Wales' economic destiny as we'd like to see it,\" he said. \"Of course, on current structures they can't, they simply aren't like Tata which is a company which is incredibly valuable in so many ways. \"A back office for a bank simply can't do the same things for Wales, no matter how many bums on seats there are in those call centres. They don't provide the same jobs or a narrative for the Welsh economy that will give us a future vision.\" Prof Jones said the steel industry in Wales had done relatively well to avoid the worst of the crisis so far. \"There have been big rounds of redundancies over the last 30 years and we've a very lean operation in Wales and geographically we're better placed than those steelworks in the north of England and Scotland.\"",

        "article": "A room is full of women looking like they have cried for hours, if not for days. Sat on the floor leaning against each wall, they don't say much. Instead, they wail, wipe their tears and hug each other to share the pain. Ayse Aygun's 18 year-old son Salih had gone across the border to Syria, to join the Kurdish YPG militants and fight against the Islamic State group (IS). He was killed two weeks ago in a clash at the town of Sirrin. Ayse's family and friends try to be there for her in these difficult times. It is more than losing a child for Ayse. The Turkish authorities will not allow her son's body back into the country to be buried. \"My son wasn't fighting the Turkish army\" she says. \"He was fighting the IS. IS beheaded people. They killed the elderly. Why aren't they allowing my son back? This is an insult.\" More than 4,000 people from Turkey, predominantly Kurds, have gone to fight against the IS since the assault on Kobani started late last year. Up until recently, those killed were allowed back for their funerals. Over 200 YPG fighters have been buried in Turkey so far. But now the bodies of 23 fighters have been stopped at the border. Salih's aunt Islim says they spoke to the local governor to help them bring his body into Turkey. \"He told us it was beyond him. He said there was a cabinet decree. He told us there was nothing he could do\" she says. \"But we want our brother to be buried in our land. We could go visit his grave, say a prayer. He should be near us.\" Families suspect, all this is part of a measure to keep the border town of Suruc calm. Here, an attack by the group calling themselves Islamic State killed 32 people last month. The culture centre where the bomb went off still bears the scars of the attack. Pictures of the dead young activists, along with various toys for kids they intended to take to Kobane are laid out in the garden - at the exact spot where the attack took place. But on the streets of Suruc life is back to normal. There are security forces present of course, but that has been part of daily life for some time, given the proximity to the Syrian border. What happened in this predominantly Kurdish town across the border from Kobane changed Turkey and the security landscape dramatically. After the attack, the Turkish government launched what it called \"a synchronised war on terror\" on several fronts. Operations against IS were followed by a crackdown on the Kurdish militant group PKK and other radical leftist groups. The level of threat in the country has increased to extent not seen in recent years. Early this week the most violent attacks since the crackdown took place, in retaliation for the increasing military operations against the PKK. As the once solid ceasefire is in tatters, many fear peace is now something of the past and there's more trouble ahead. Ayse had 11 sons. One is now dead in Syria. Another is a soldier in the Turkish army. And another is a policeman. She says she wants peace so that mothers won't have to shed any more tears. But the soldier son, who speaks on condition of anonymity, is more pessimistic. \"We were more than brothers, Salih and I. We were best friends. I'm a soldier. He died in Kobane. We want peace. \"But how is peace attainable when they don't even let us bury our dead?\" he asks.",

However, recent tensions at the border have stopped the return of 23 fighters' bodies, sparking accusations of a measure to keep the border town of Suruc calm.

The two countries had been locked in a diplomatic row in the wake of Mr Kim's murder in Kuala Lumpur last month. Both countries had banned each other's citizens from leaving. \"The body of the DPRK citizen who died in Malaysia and relevant DPRK citizens have returned to the DPRK today via Beijing,\" Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said during a regular press briefing, using the country's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. North Korea is widely suspected of having orchestrated the killing with a nerve agent in Kuala Lumpur's airport. Three North Koreans who had been wanted for questioning have now been allowed to leave Malaysia, Malaysia's chief of police said. \"We have obtained whatever we wanted from them'' and are \"satisfied\" with the statements, Khalid Abu Bakar said. In the wake of Mr Kim's killing on 13 February, Pyongyang reacted angrily when Malaysia refused to hand over the body immediately, without an autopsy. Malaysian authorities said they had the right to conduct an autopsy as he had been killed on Malaysian soil, and that they would only release the body to Mr Kim's family. On Thursday, Mr Najib said a formal request had been received from the family, but gave no further details. A day later, national police chief Khalid Abu Bakar said \"legally speaking, Kim Jong Un is the next-of-kin\" but declined to say who the request had come from. King Jong-nam's own family previously lived in Macau but they are now thought to be in hiding. His son Kim Han-sol appeared in a video earlier this month confirming he was with his mother and sister at an unspecified location. Although he was the eldest son of the former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, Kim Jong-nam was passed over for the leadership and was living outside North Korea at the time of his father's death. Malaysia's refusal to hand over the body prompted a war of words. North Korea's ambassador Kang Chol accused Malaysia of colluding with \"hostile forces\", allegations which Kuala Lumpur dubbed as \"delusions, lies and half-truths\". Kang Chol was expelled and the Malaysian ambassador to North Korea was also recalled. Pyongyang then said it would ban all Malaysians in North Korea from leaving until the \"situation was resolved\", which Malaysia's Prime Minister Najib Razak called an \"abhorrent act\" that effectively held his citizens hostage. Kuala Lumpur enacted a tit-for-tat exit ban on North Koreans. Under the deal, the nine Malaysian nationals returned to Kuala Lumpur early on Friday, where they were met by relatives. They include the country's counsellor to North Korea, Mohd Nor Azrin Md Zain, embassy staff, and their families. The exact circumstances of how the deal was struck remain unclear. Malaysia's Prime Minister Najib Razak described the negotiations as \"challenging\". Foreign Minister Anifah Aman hailed the exchange as a success of diplomacy and \"level-headedness\". Reuters reported that television footage showed two North Koreans on the flight to Beijing with the body: Hyon Kwang Song, the second secretary at the North Korean embassy in Kuala Lumpur, and Kim Uk Il, a North Korean state airline employee. The third was named Ri Ji U, who had been holed up with them in the North Korean Embassy, Reuters quoted the chief of police as saying.",

Ayoze Perez, Chancel Mbemba and Dwight Gayle scored in a comfortable victory, but it was Jack Grealish's 89th-minute goal which sealed the Magpies' title. Perez's flicked finish made it 1-0, before Mbemba smashed in to double the lead from a Perez rebound. Gayle added a late third before Grealish's goal handed them the title. It was a comfortable win for Rafael Benitez's side - yet it looked like it would not be enough to seal top spot, after Glenn Murray's penalty had put league leaders Brighton in front at Villa Park. However, despite being down to 10 men following Nathan Baker's red card, Grealish beat Brighton keeper David Stockdale to send the Magpies above Brighton in the table. At St James' Park, DeAndre Yedlin terrorised Barnsley down the right-hand side and it was his cross which Perez guided into the bottom corner to open the scoring. Christian Atsu forced Barnsley goalkeeper Adam Davies into two strong diving saves with powerful shots and Massadio Haidara smashed a good chance over the crossbar from Perez's cut-back as the hosts dominated. Davies kept out Jack Colback with his legs, but the Magpies got a deserved second when Davies pushed Perez's shot out perfectly for Mbemba to smash home his first goal for the club. Jonjo Shelvey struck the post before Aleksandar Mitrovic's header sent substitute Gayle through to complete the scoring with a confident finish past the onrushing Davies. Under manager Benitez, Newcastle brought 12 players to the club after dropping into the Championship last summer, with Matt Ritchie and Gayle moving down a division to sign five-year deals. With more than \u00a350 million spent in transfer fees alone, the Magpies were under pressure to achieve promotion - a feat they managed with two games to spare. Benitez's side have battled with Brighton throughout the season for top spot, but since the Seagulls achieved promotion on 17 April they have dropped off the pace dramatically. Ultimately it is three straight wins for Newcastle and three matches without three points for Chris Hughton's side that has told, giving the Toon the perfect end to the campaign.

The English 16-time world champion beat the Belgian 4-2 at Alexandra Palace. Taylor will meet five-time world champion Van Barneveld for the fourth time at the tournament. Dutch top seed Michael van Gerwen beat England's Darren Webster 4-1 while Scottish third seed Peter Wright beat England's Ian White by the same score. Taylor battled back from behind in each of the opening three sets to lead 3-0, only to see 13th seed Huybrechts narrow the gap to 3-2. But the fourth seed survived the spirited comeback, sealing victory at the second opportunity in the sixth set to tee up the meeting with long-time rival Van Barneveld on Friday. Taylor has won two of their three previous encounters at the event, with Van Barneveld prevailing 7-6 in an epic 2007 final. Fellow Dutchman Van Gerwen was pushed by Webster - who was the lowest-ranked player left in the competition - in the first two sets, then took the third without dropping a leg. Webster, 46 from Norwich, arguably raised the biggest cheer of the night when he held off the Dutchman to win the fourth set. Both players came close to nine-dart checkouts in the fifth set, with Van Gerwen punishing his opponent's inability to complete the feat by sealing victory with his next throw. In Thursday's afternoon session, sixth seed James Wade twice fought back from two-set deficits to beat fellow Englishman Michael Smith 4-3. Smith raced into a 2-0 advantage and then led 3-1 before Wade clinched victory by winning seven straight legs. England's Dave Chisnall reached the quarter-finals for the first time as he held off Dutchman Jelle Klaasen to earn a 4-2 victory.

        "article": "In our series of letters from African journalists, film-maker and columnist Farai Sevenzo questions whether lie detectors could help promote honest law enforcement. Last week's news that Nigeria's Inspector General of Police, Ibrahim Idris, wants all new recruits to the country's police force to undergo a lie detector test cannot have been an April fool's joke as it's now the end of August. A police statement stated clearly that the \"polygraph test is aimed at ensuring that candidates are not of questionable character\", and that new police officers should \"conform to acceptable standards necessary for an ideal police officer the Nigerian people deserve\". Tendai Biti, Zimbabwe's former finance minister: \"Whenever I see a policeman, I run away because he sees me as an ATM\" Just what sort of questions would be set for the future cops is not clear, but the move is innovative and opens up all manner of possibilities on the African political landscape in our search for the kind of public officials the continent deserves. And why stop at just police recruits? Journalists could be asked: \"Have you ever taken money to write or ignore a story?\" Football players in the Under-17 World Cup could break out in a sweat at the simple inquiry: \"How old are you?\" Politicians and presidents, meanwhile, may find the truth-telling exercise a challenge too far. The search for honest police officers who fulfil the \"acceptable standards\" sought by Nigeria's police chief could be extended to most African states. Back in July, citizens in the Zimbabwean capital, Harare, vented their anger over phony police roadblocks, which crop up every few miles \"to check the roadworthiness\" of vehicles, but more importantly provide a pretext to spot-fine drivers and extract money from impoverished commuters. And since the state is struggling to pay public workers, it is entirely credible that such fines exist to supplement the officers' meagre and late salaries. \"Whenever I see a policeman, I run away because he sees me as an ATM,\" declared Tendai Biti, former finance minister. Encounters with African police forces can also be deadly. Ethiopian police clashed with demonstrators demanding answers to human rights abuses in the north-west of the country, and several people lost their lives in the city of Bahir Dar in the Amhara region. Farai Sevenzo: \"Following orders, history has sometimes instructed us, is not a credible excuse\" Force is the default setting for African police, with officers deployed on the streets willing to unleash tear gas in Nairobi, Harare, Lusaka, Addis Ababa or any other African capital. Anti-government demonstrations in Harare last week saw water-cannon and yet more tear gas as the government blamed unknown \"foreign elements\" for trying to incite rebellion. In the age of instant news and social media sharing, the evidence of African police brutality is a click away and all over the web. So, would a polygraph test for new recruits lessen such incidents? What kind of questions would the recruits have to answer? Would there be questions about their sympathy for the beaten citizens? Or would they be about their loyalty to entrenched police chiefs who have had jobs for life, much like the men who appointed them? As governments face dissent, citizens are promoting the idea that those police officers firing live bullets into groups of demonstrators, or starring in their own brutality videos as they rain down truncheon blows on fleeing citizens, should be recorded, identified and have their details stored for future prosecutions. Following orders, history has sometimes instructed us, is not a credible excuse. Whatever becomes of the Nigerian inspector general's intriguing idea to introduce lie-detector tests, he should remember the double-edged nature of such an exercise. The polygraph reveals the truth-tellers and may show him honest cops who pass the test, but it will also give him the best liars who will bluff their way through anything. More from Farai Sevenzo:",

        "article": "Estonia is the most northerly of the three Baltic states, and has linguistic ties with Finland. Since regaining its independence with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Estonia has become one of the most economically successful of the European Union's newer eastern European members. Ruled at various times during the middle ages by Denmark, the German knights of the Livonian Order, and Sweden, Estonia ended up part of the Russian Empire in the 18th century. It experienced its first period of independence in 1918, following the end of the First World War and the collapse of the Russian Empire. Country profiles compiled by BBC Monitoring But the new state, which underwent periods of both democratic and authoritarian rule, was short-lived. After only 20 years, Estonia was forcefully incorporated into Soviet Union in 1940, following a pact between Hitler and Stalin. German troops occupied Estonia during World War II, before being driven out by the Soviet army. Few nations formally recognised the Soviet annexation, and Estonians consider it an illegal occupation. One of its legacies is a large Russian minority - about a quarter of the population, according to the 2011 census. In Soviet times, the influx of non-Estonians led some to fear for the survival of Estonian culture and language. The Russians' status has been a cause of controversy. Some, including the Russian government, criticise requirements needed to obtain Estonian citizenship - especially the need to show a proficiency in the Estonian language - that left most ethnic Russians stateless after independence. Estonia says the criteria for citizenship are similar to those of most nations around the world, and have been in any case gradually eased. It says the number of stateless persons has dropped by 80% between 1992 and 2013. Since independence, Estonia has politically and economically anchored itself firmly to the West, joining the EU and Nato in 2004. It sent a contingent of troops as part of Nato operations in Afghanistan. Russia's intervention in the Ukrainian crisis in 2014 has triggered some nervousness in Estonia over President Vladimir Putin's intentions towards other former Soviet states. The Estonian government has been fiercely critical of Russia's behaviour and has affirmed its pro-Nato stance in response to the events in Ukraine. Estonian governments have tended to pursue strongly free-market economic policies, privatising state enterprises, introducing a flat-rate income tax, liberalising regulation, encouraging free trade and keeping public debt low. There has also been a strong emphasis on making Estonia a world leader in technology, leading some to speak of an \"e-economy\". This has included creating one of the world's fastest broadband networks, offering widespread free wireless internet, encouraging technology start-ups and putting government services online. In 2007, Estonia was the first country to allow online voting in a general election. The country experienced an investment boom in the early 2000s, especially after EU membership, with high annual growth rates hovering between 7-10%. In 2008, Estonia's economy was hit by the global financial crisis. The government adopted tough austerity measures and won plaudits for getting the economy back into shape. The country joined the European single currency in January 2011. The Estonian language is closely related to Finnish and - more distantly - Hungarian, but not to the Indo-European languages of the two other Baltic states - Latvia and Lithuania - or Russian for that matter. The country has unique musical and dance traditions, including a long tradition of choral singing.",

        "article": "Richie Ramsay didn't win the Scottish Open at Castle Stuart, but he wore a contented smile none the less having played himself into the top-six and securing himself a place in The Open Championship at Royal Troon later this week. At one point in his final round of 67, Ramsay looked like he might take his challenge to the wire, closing to within a single shot of the eventual champion, Alex Noren, following a run of four straight birdies  in his opening six holes. He said he stood on the 10th tee believing for the first time in his life that he could win a title that he says would mean almost as much to him as a major championship. Not enough putts dropped on the back nine - he gave himself multiple opportunities - and he had to settle for the consolation prize of a slot in The Open. Ramsay asked about Andy Murray in the aftermath and called the now two-time Wimbledon champion an inspiration. \"Watching Andy play at Wimbledon this week, watching Jamie play, those guys are huge inspirations for Scottish people,\" he said. \"To win Wimbledon is a massive achievement and I think sometimes we take that for granted, we forget how good he is. \"It's great watching him, because he's Scottish and because he's got that grit and fire. I love that attitude. For me, every week is about trying to be the best I can be. \"When I'm 60, I want to sit in my chair watching the golf and be able to say that I won X number of tour titles and that I couldn't squeeze any more out of the talent I had. Talent is great, but if you don't have that hard work ethic, you're not to get anywhere.\" Ramsay has won three times on tour, the most recent of them being the Trophee Hassan in March last year. He's played in The Open five times, missing the cut on three occasions. His best finish was 58th at Muirfield in 2013. He was tied for 68th at St Andrews last year. His performance here rather came out of the blue. Ramsay finished sixth in China in May, but his form since then has been poor, his best finish a 43rd. His season had been a grind up until Castle Stuart. \"I just loved it out there,\" he said. \"I didn't come out with a tentative attitude, which has sometimes been my fault in the past. I hit some great shots. \"I knew, standing on that 10th tee, that I could win the tournament and that's a great feeling. I just have to take that into the next year and see if I can get this title in the bag one of these years. \"From a confidence point of view, I will think to myself that I had a chance to win a huge tournament. You're halfway there when you believe you can do it. I know I have a lot more in the tank.\" Castle Stuart didn't get the champion it wanted, with due credit to the excellent Noren, but it was a terrific host venue. The troubling aspect - and it's reflective of golf's serious problem - was the size of the crowd on each of the four days. The total attendance for Thursday-Sunday was 41,809. The final round brought the smallest number of fans - 8,733 - of the week. There was a Murray effect there for sure. But it's a much wider issue than that. Last year at Gullane, the Scottish brought in a total crowd of 63,000, which was, in turn, less than the 65,833 that attended the year before at Royal Aberdeen. The small numbers this time are partly on account of geography but also to do with golf's diminishing attraction as a spectator sport. None of that bothered Noren, of course. Nor Ramsay. If there was a competition to find the widest smile at Castle Stuart last night, the two of them would have been locked in a dead heat.",

He is one of a number of refugees and asylum seekers living in Belfast who spend their spare time doing voluntary conservation and preservation work in the Mourne mountains in County Down. In Algeria, his home country, he was a police officer, but \"problems with my government and a terrorist group\" forced him to flee. He has been in Northern Ireland for 18 months now - it is his \"new home\". These mountains are where Mohammed and others displaced from their homelands come regularly to find peace. They are working with the Mourne Heritage Trust, which looks after this area of outstanding natural beauty, to rebuild dry-stone walls and repair mountain paths. The walls are one of the most unmistakable features of the Mournes, with hundreds of miles stretching over mountain peaks, dividing land and providing shelter for livestock and other wildlife. The skills to build them - patience, an eye for a good stone, and a strong back, among other things - have been passed down through generations. And now these refugees are learning them, too. For Mohammed, this is his first time working on the walls: \"I think it's very good experience for me.\" With about 100 Syrian refugees expected to arrive in Northern Ireland before Christmas, the volunteer scheme could soon play a bigger role in offering a tranquil retreat to more people who have left conflict-hit countries. Mediation Northern Ireland is one of the charities helping refugees and asylum seekers to settle into their new lives. Mary McAnulty from the organisation says it works closely with the Mourne Heritage Trust. The intention has been to help the refugees to make new friends, improve their language skills and explore part the country they now call home. \"Lots of people suffer from anxieties, so having a day out of Belfast is great,\" Mary says. \"If your world is very small, just the area you live in, then these can be your hills. \"I love to see people becoming proud of it and feeling that they have a sense of place.\" Amar, who has moved to Belfast with his family from Sudan, says getting outside the city \"is good for me\". And for Elizabeth, who is Colombian, the fresh countryside air is \"good for my mind\". But it is not just a one-way thing. Large areas of walls have become damaged due to erosion and increasing visitor numbers, and the Mourne Heritage Trust relies on volunteers to do the repair work. Ranger John McEvoy says the trust is indebted to the refugees. \"They're willing to get the sleeves rolled up, get stuck into it,\" he explains. \"As the day goes on, you'll see them lifting the stone, doing exactly as we're doing.\" And Dean Fitzpatrick, a Mourne man who comes from a family of stoneworkers, says you do not have to be born and bred in the shadow of the mountains to chip in. \"There are boys here who aren't stonemasons at all, from all different parts of the world,\" he says. \"They're doing as good as anybody and they've only been here an hour or two.\" As Mohammed removes his gloves and wipes his brow after the work is done, his smile is wide. \"Here it's very quiet - everything is perfect for me here.\"",

Nick D'Aloisio told the BBC he was currently deciding between working full-time for the California-based company or going to university. The 18-year-old has just released an iPad edition of Yahoo's News Digest, for which he acts as project manager. He is also developing an Apple Watch version, among other projects. \"For the lightweight news consumption that we have, [News] Digest is absolutely suited for this device,\" he said. \"Because of the summarisation element to this app, it just inherently makes sense when you have a constrained screen. \"We've been thinking about designing the concept of taking Digest to wearables for a while now, and we're going to jump at the opportunity.\" The app's icon briefly features during the Watch promotional video on Apple's site. Mr D'Aloisio said his team had already begun work on the software before the launch event, but had been kept \"in the dark\" about how the device functioned. He added that he also intended to bring the app to Android Wear smartwatches. News Digest has already been downloaded to about 1.3 million iPhones and 623,000 Android handsets, according to analytics provider Xyo. Yahoo would not confirm those numbers, but said that it believed: Mr D'Aloisio was only 16 years old when he secured a $250,000 (\u00c2\u00a3154,000) investment in his software from Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-Shing. He subsequently launched the app Summly as a standalone news-summarisation product, but it was only a few months before Yahoo acquired the technology and his services, in a deal reported to be worth \u00c2\u00a320m. Since then he has headed up a team of about a dozen software engineers and designers to create and run News Digest, at the same time as sitting his A-level exams. Yahoo's app delivers two daily briefings of eight to nine stories, which are assembled by algorithms using text, images and videos sourced from online providers including: Once the user has clicked through all the material, a graphic tells them they are \"done\". \"It's been very intense because I'm accountable and in charge of this product,\" Mr D'Aloisio told the BBC. \"So, for the last year-and-a-half I've been flying back and forth between London and California.\" Having achieved high enough grades to qualify for his university offers, he now faces a choice as to whether to start a degree in October or not. \"I'm still undecided - I'm weighing up university and Yahoo,\" he explained. \"But I think there could be a nice middle ground here, where I think I could potentially... be doing some higher study as well as continuing on with Digest. \"I am still very passionate about continuing my education, that's precisely why I made sure I finished school with everyone else in my age group, But at the same time this is a great product and we're working on some really exciting things.\" For the moment, Mr D'Aloisio is promoting the iPad edition of Yahoo's app, which introduces new features. These include: The app can be downloaded globally and configured to run in a UK, US, Canadian or World edition. The software will compete against a growing number of other news briefing services including Flipboard, Circa and Feedly. Not everyone is enamoured with the idea of such services piggybacking the work of  journalists. \"The big question is, are these apps providing added value for readers and publishers, or are they just another parasitical kind of aggregator,\" asked Dominic Ponsford, editor of the Press Gazette site. \"There's so much aggregation going on online - just listing and lifting other people's stories and content isn't what you need.\" But Mr D'Aloisio defends News Digest's model, saying it acts as a \"trusted curator\", providing bite-sized chunks of news to busy readers, and offering links to the original sources for those with more time. Time is something he is now short of himself, and while he may be famous for being the \"teenage coder who made millions\", he acknowledges he does not do much programming himself anymore. \"I do dabble in the iPhone coding for the application, but by and large my role has moved from doing a lot of the coding to becoming more of a product manager - so, I'm in charge of the design, the branding, the strategy, the development of it,\" he said. \"That is by and large what I spend my time on. \"But I have also been helping out with a few other efforts that have yet to be announced.\"",

        "article": "A UKIP MEP has told the party's conference the ban on smoking in public places in England has \"damaged more communities than the pit closures did\". At a fringe meeting about which political party best spoke for the working class, Tim Aker said the 2005 ban had upped levels of hidden drinking by forcing people \"to retreat inwards\". It was evidence of a \"bankrupt\" Labour telling people \"what to do and think\". Senior UKIP figures have also targeted new Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. UKIP made big inroads into traditional Labour heartlands in May's election - coming second to the party in a host of seats in the north of England - but it has been suggested that Mr Corbyn's election could halt this momentum. But Mr Aker, who lost to Labour by 800 votes in Thurrock in May, said Labour had \"ceased to exist\" as a party of working people, choosing to \"lecture rather than represent them\". Citing the smoking ban as an example of a policy that had hit C1 and C2 workers, he said: \"They (Labour) say all the time, despite ignoring the facts, that it was the pit closures that destroyed all the communities. \"But I put it to you that the smoking ban has destroyed more communities than any any pit closure has done because when people don't have a place to meet, a place to socialise, they retreat in. \"What sort of outcome is it to say 'we don't want you drinking and smoking, take it out of the licensed area', and it goes all the way back to the homes where people are drinking and smoking more in front of their children.\" In contrast to Labour, he said, UKIP would stand up for working people by giving them more power over their lives. \"We are the ones that embrace the one concept that has helped working class voters more than the minimum wage, more than anything else - the greatest thing for the working class is democracy.\" Speaking to the BBC later, Mr Aker said the closure of pubs in many communities meant \"there was no community left\". He insisted he did not mean to \"belittle the hardships of those who lost their jobs in the pits\" but sought to \"draw a parallel between their closures and the closure of pubs\". Speaking at the same meeting, former vice-chairman Suzanne Evans said Mr Corbyn was an \"unreconstructed communist and like all communists it is the poorest who will suffer (under him)\". And speaking in the hall, deputy leader Paul Nuttall said Mr Corbyn was a \"trendy lefty\" rather than a working class hero and suggested that working people would not warm to a man \"who says nice things about the IRA, wants to give the Falklands back to the Argentinians and, above all, won't sing the national anthem\". More than ever before, he suggested, UKIP was poised to become the alternative to Labour in the Midlands and the north of England and to the Tories in the south of England. But it would only continue to make inroads in the traditional Labour vote if it was \"bold and told it like it is\". He added: \"We must not tone down our language. We must not change. If we change and sound like all the rest, we are finished.\" Meanwhile, Matthew Goodwin - professor of politics at the University of Kent and the author of a book on UKIP's rise - has cast doubt on whether Mr Corbyn's election will stop the leaching of Labour votes to UKIP. Mr Goodwin told the fringe meeting that past assumptions that UKIP voters were \"exiled Tories who liked to wear tweed and corduroy and spend most of their time playing golf\" had been scotched by its performance in May - when it attracted 29% of working class votes, compared with Labour's 27%. \"Labour is in real trouble among these groups and it is not a problem that is going to be fixed by Jeremy Corbyn,\" he said. But he warned that UKIP, as well as other parties, risked losing working class voters to \"political apathy\".",

Sabah Saleem, 11, and three-year-old Rayhan were hit by a car driven by 37-year-old Mohammed Khalil Anwar on Brudenell Road in August 2012. Leeds Crown Court heard that Anwar, of Brudenell Mount, failed to stop as he feared being attacked by local people. Anwar is due to be sentenced on 29 November. Sabah and Rayhan, who were 10 and two at the time of the incident, were knocked down by Anwar's Vauxhall Astra car on 18 August last year. They were returning from a greengrocer's shop with food for the family's Eid celebrations which were due to take place the following day. Both underwent surgery at Leeds General Infirmary. While Rayhan was discharged from hospital a few days later, Sabah remained in hospital for about six months and surgeons operated on her several times. The court was told she had been left with \"significant and permanent\" disabilities as a result of the crash. During his trial, Anwar told the court he was in control of his car at the time of the collision, but he had no time to react when Sabah and Rayhan ran out in front of him. The court heard Anwar was driving at nearly 35 mph along Brudenell Road when he collided with the two children, about 15 mph faster than the speed limit. Anwar admitted he did not know the speed limit was 20 mph along that stretch of road, even though he had regularly driven along there over the past 12 years. He told the court he drove off after hitting the children as he was afraid he would be attacked. Following the verdict, Sabah said she still could not remember anything about the accident. While she still found it \"very difficult\" to walk, she was now feeling \"okay\", she said. Sabah's father, Saleem Rafique, said his \"very brave\" daughter was still recovering. The 11-year-old continues to suffer from double vision, balance problems and memory loss, he said. \"She was a really bright kid, doing really well at school and very determined to succeed. \"Unfortunately, this happened and that has put her back. \"She's tough, she's a real fighter but we don't know whether she will be the same as she was before.

        "article": "A ban on top council-run schools sponsoring failing schools amounts to \"red tape\" and should be dropped, say council bosses. In England, only schools with academy status are allowed to form trusts to sponsor weaker schools. And, the Local Government Association said, a shortage of \"good quality\" sponsors often left failing schools \"in the dark about their future\". Ministers said there was no legal frame for council schools to be sponsors. The Local Government Association says 91% of council maintained schools are rated  good or outstanding by education watchdog Ofsted - so they should be allowed \"to play a direct role in raising education standards and improving life chances, including taking on the running of failing academies\". New analysis of Ofsted ratings for the LGA by education analysts Angel Solutions found a higher percentage of good and outstanding grades among council maintained schools than among academies. Of 14,890 council maintained schools inspected, 91% are rated good or outstanding by Ofsted, compared with 85% of 5,058 academies, say the researchers. There are wide variations within the academy category, with sponsored academies, which are forced into academy status after poor Ofsted ratings, predictably faring worse than converter academies, which must be rated good or outstanding before being allowed to convert. The LGA points out that the majority of academies are converter academies. Inspection ratings for 4,103 converter academies showed 89% rated good or outstanding but among the 955 sponsored academies inspected the figure was only 65%, according to the analysis. Richard Watts, chairman of the LGA's Children and Young People Board, said the figures proved councils had \"the track record, experience and expertise to help lift schools out of academic failure\". \"The government must commit to removing the unnecessary red tape and give high performing maintained schools the option of becoming academy sponsors. \"Councils want to be regarded as improvement partners, not obstructionists to school improvement,\" said Mr Watts, who is also the leader of Islington Council. \"With a shortage of academy sponsors and struggling schools currently in the dark about their future the simplest remedy is to give councils the power to turn these schools around where this is the best option locally.\" Mr Watts also voiced concerns about the local knowledge and capacity of the eight Regional Schools Commissioners, whose job is to oversee academic standards. He said that without the help of councils \"the early warning signs of failing\" risked being overlooked. \"It is not acceptable that we have to wait for poor exam results, whistle-blowing about financial impropriety or an Ofsted inspection to trigger intervention. \"Councils are best placed to oversee school effectiveness and take immediate action where required,\" added Mr Watts. A Department for Education spokesman said there was no legal framework for a council or council-run school to sponsor a school unless they opened a trust - and this would involve converting to academy status. \"We would encourage good or outstanding council-run schools to apply to become a sponsor so they can share their expertise,\" said the spokesman. The spokesman said councils could not run multi-academy trusts \"as legally less than 20% of members and trustees are allowed to be 'local authority influenced' to ensure the trust remains autonomous from the local authority\".",

Tigers are fifth after a season of struggle which has seen them sack director of rugby Richard Cockerill. They are in danger of missing out on a top-four finish in the league for the first time since the 2003-04 season. \"There's a lot more to come from this team,\" Murphy told BBC Leicester Sport. \"Hopefully the Anglo-Welsh Cup can be the catalyst to kick on in the Premiership. There is a long way to go in the season. \"I am confident we can make the top four and challenge when everyone is looking around and saying 'what are you doing here?' We can answer that emphatically.\" Tigers are a point behind fourth-placed Bath with five games remaining, but 11 adrift of Saracens who are third. They have lost seven of their 17 matches, but welcome respite has come in the Anglo-Welsh Cup where they beat Saracens 32-10 in Saturday's semi-final. Murphy, who is part of Aaron Mauger's backroom set-up and has been on the coaching team since retiring in 2013 after 16 seasons as a Tigers player, has taken on a leading role in this season's competition. The 38-year-old said the players fully deserved their place in the final at Twickenham Stoop. \"A lot of people have been saying, 'Hold on a second. How did you guys get here? That wasn't in the script',\" he said. \"We have been really good so far in the competition. We have picked some young guys, some inexperienced guys and some players who haven't had a lot of field time. \"We have developed a hell of a lot. We have had different styles of wins. Our opening win against Bath was really tenacious; we had to dig in and fight for everything and we won by a point. \"We had a good win against Newport at home where we put some scores on and played more attractive rugby. And we had a tight win against Saints. \"We went away to Saracens in the pool stages and lost, but the most impressive thing for me was that we learned the lessons from that game. We went back down there at the weekend and executed a game plan and got into the final. Our forwards had a great game. \"The consistent thing from the players who have taken the field is they have been really passionate and have worked hard for each other. \"One of the things we have asked of them is to be able look at each other at the end of the game and know they have given it absolutely everything.

        "article": "In Britain, Argentine Diego Simeone is best remembered as the man whose reaction to a petulant kick by David Beckham resulted in the England star famously being sent off during a World Cup game in 1998. That is a harsh reflection on his playing career, though, because Simeone was a magnificent midfielder, winning 106 international caps and starring in Serie A for Inter Milan and Lazio as well as guiding Atletico to a league and cup double in 1996 (their most recent La Liga triumph). And now, Simeone is carving a new career as one of the game's hottest managerial properties, with his approach to coaching mirroring the blend of winning attitude and technical aptitude that characterised his playing days. If you asked Diego Simeone how his Atletico Madrid team have overcome all the odds to progress to the Champions League semi-finals, where they will face Jose Mourinho's Chelsea, as well as topping La Liga with just six games remaining, he would provide you with a simple answer: \"Hard work and humility.\" Indeed, that is exactly the mantra he has been preaching on a weekly basis this season, as the football world continues to wonder when - or if at all - his steamroller of a team will finally run out of puff. Until recently, most people assumed it would simply be a matter of time. When, not if. But Wednesday's famous victory over Barcelona, where Atletico succeeded in knocking the Catalan team out of the Champions League before the last four for the first time since 2007, sent a loud and clear message: Atletico Madrid are for real. To a great extent, Simeone's assessment of his Atletico team's greatest strengths - hard work and humility - is absolutely right. Atletico were only four points above the La Liga relegation zone when Diego Simeone became coach in December 2011. Within 18 months he had guided them to the Europa League, Uefa Super Cup and Copa del Rey titles. The discipline, intensity and sheer, uncompromising effort of their play is unrivalled. That was never more evident in the opening stages on Wednesday, when Atletico's whirlwind of attacking pressure simply blew Barcelona away, resulting in Koke netting the only goal of the game and David Villa thumping shots against the woodwork twice inside the opening 20 minutes. Hard work and humility - as well as, to use Simeone's other favourite phrase, going from game to game - have allowed Atletico's bunch of largely unheralded journeymen, none of whom (with the exception of Villa) were superstars before they arrived at the Vicente Calderon, to barge their way without an invitation into the upper echelons of world football. For any football fan who has become cynical about the modern game's tendency to be ruled by huge dollops of money, Atletico's unstoppable rise has been a breath of fresh air. In the days of Arab sheikhs, Russian oligarchs and American business tycoons, low-budget teams like Atletico simply aren't supposed to do this well. Yet here they are, with less than six weeks of the season remaining, still in strong contention for the two most prestigious prizes on offer. That is, indeed, largely down to the relentless work ethic instilled by Simeone. But it would be very wrong to suggest that Atletico's current success is simply down to the fact that they run around a lot, because there is also a huge amount of quality and intelligence within their ranks. That starts on the training ground, where Simeone and his gruff assistant Mono Burgos prepare the perfect tactics to suit their team's strengths. Under Simeone's instruction, Atletico are defensively disciplined, unsurpassably organised and play with great game awareness, knowing when to press ferociously in numbers and when to sit deep, waiting for the right opportunity to pounce upon their hapless opponents and launch a rapid, pinpoint counter-attack. As the eloquent Argentine boss explained in the build-up to his team's latest triumph, Barcelona's strength lies in controlling possession; Atletico's lies in controlling space. Simeone's attention to detail and his ability to clearly communicate his plans ensures that his players have mastered the art of playing the game where they want to, while simultaneously forcing their opponents into areas where they feel uncomfortable. More than anything, though, Simeone's unbounding positivity and unshakeable belief that good habits, when consistently applied on a day to day basis, will lead to winning performances has succeeded in completely turning Atletico's image on its head. For years, Madrid's second team suffered from a severe inferiority complex as neighbouring Real ruled the roost and the rest of Spain derided them as hapless bunglers who always managed to somehow mess everything up. That reputation was most famously captured in a notorious television advert, when a forlorn young boy asked his frowning father: \"Porque somos del Atleti?\" Why are we Atleti fans? It was a sort of Spanish equivalent to \"Accrington Stanley\u2026who are dey?\" and illustrated the inescapable sense of inevitable doom which habitually engulfed Atletico fans as they lurched from disaster to disaster. Under Simeone, Atletico are finally shattering that conception; their manager is even an image of vibrant self-belief as he prowls the touchline during games, constantly turning to the crowd and vigorously urging them to applaud the players for their wholehearted effort. When referee Howard Webb blew the final whistle at the Vicente Calderon on Wednesday, tremendous scenes of jubilation were unleashed, with the home fans - chanting and singing with a relentlessness almost matching their team - refusing to leave the shaking stadium until their heroes re-emerged from the tunnel to embark upon a celebratory lap of honour. As the players finally gave way to those demands and dragged their weary bodies back onto the pitch, to be sportingly saluted even by the travelling Barcelona fans, one man was conspicuous by his absence. Diego Simeone was apparently nowhere to be seen. But he was there all right, hiding on his own at the back of the dugout, quietly watching the scenes of celebration he had helped to create with obvious pride, seemingly struggling to force back tears. After the hard work, the humility. Former Liverpool and Republic of Ireland forward Michael Robinson, who finished his playing career in Spain and is now the country's foremost television pundit, concluded his rhapsody over Atletico's performance by enthusing: \"It's impossible not to admire them.\" Robinson is exactly right. \"Why are we Atletico fans?\" Right now, the more pertinent question is why anyone wouldn't be.",

The company insists it is still committed to launching the smart glasses as a consumer product, but will stop producing Glass in its present form. Instead it will focus on \"future versions of Glass\" with work carried out by a different division to before. The Explorer programme, which gave software developers the chance to buy Glass for $1,500 (\u00c2\u00a3990) will close. The programme was launched in the United States in 2013. It was then opened up to anyone and was launched in the UK last summer. It had been expected that it would be followed reasonably quickly by a full consumer launch. From next week, the search firm will stop taking orders for the product but it says it will continue to support companies that are using Glass. The Glass team will also move out of the Google X division which engages in \"blue sky\" research, and become a separate undertaking, under its current manager Ivy Ross. She and the Glass team will report to Tony Fadell, the chief executive of the home automation business Nest, acquired by Google a year ago. He said the project had \"broken ground and allowed us to learn what's important to consumers and enterprises alike\" and he was excited to be working with the team \"to integrate those learnings into future products\". Google says it is committed to working on the future of the product, but gave no timescale for the launch of any new version. The Glass project received the enthusiastic backing of Google's co-founder Sergey Brin. He presided over a spectacular unveiling which saw skydivers jump out of an aircraft wearing Glass and beam what they were seeing to a conference in San Francisco. Early users of Glass were very excited about the product, which enabled them get information in a small screen above their right eye, take photos and videos, and get directions. The technology blogger Robert Scoble said he could not now imagine living a day without the product, and was even photographed wearing it in the shower. But he and others soon tired of Glass, complaining that it was not evolving in the ways that had been promised. There were also concerns about privacy and safety, with some bars and restaurants banning the use of the smart glasses on their premises. Other companies have launched smart glasses and various other forms of wearable technology. But no single product has yet proved the major hit that technology companies are looking for as they seek out the next big thing. Google has tried to present this announcement as just another step in the evolution of an amazing innovation. But make no mistake - Google Glass is dead, at least in its present form. As I found when I spent a couple of months wearing Glass, it has a number of really useful aspects - in particular the camera. There is however one huge disadvantage - it makes its users look daft, and that meant that it was never going to appeal to a wide audience. But Google will now have to deal with a disgruntled community of Explorers who paid a large sum for a device which they must have believed would eventually evolve into something more useful. The Glass team can at least continue its work out of the spotlight without the pressure of deadlines. Tony Fadell, the former Apple designer Google acquired with his smart thermostat firm Nest, will oversee the future of the product. Both he and the Glass team leader Ivy Ross, who has come from the fashion world, will know that form as well as function will have to be at the centre of any successful piece of wearable technology.",

        "article": "The professional tennis season comprises of hundreds of tournaments around the world and one of the most prestigious is Wimbledon. The first Championships took place in 1877 at the All England Club in London, where it's still held today. Wimbledon takes place over two weeks and it's the only major championship still played on grass. Here's your guide to the tournament... There are 128 places available in the draw for both men and women. Out of these 32 are ranked or seeded for the purposes of a draw. These seeded players are seen as the best players in the draw and they're kept apart so that they don't meet until later in the competition. In addition there are 16 qualifiers and eight wild cards, players who are given a chance to play even though their world rankings are low. The match is divided up into sets. In men's tennis you have to get three sets to win. For women it's two. To win a set you have to win six games - but you also have to get two more games than your opponent. So you can take the set 6-4, but not 6-5. In that case, you'd continue until someone won 7-5. If you get to 6-6 first, you play a tiebreak. The first person to get to seven points or more by two clear points wins the tiebreak and the set. To win a game you need to win four points. But rather than going up from one to four they go in this order: fifteen, thirty, forty, game. If you are tied on forty-all this is called deuce, and then you have to win by two clear points. The first Ladies' Championship was held in 1884, before that women weren't allowed to take part in Wimbledon. In 2007 women were granted the same amount of prize money as men. The Gentlemen's and Ladies' Singles Champions each receive \u00c2\u00a31.88m in 2015. Now, the only division between men's and women's tennis is the number of sets you have to get to win. Tennis was first played in France about 900 years ago - with people using the palms of their hands. No one really knows how the scoring started, but \"deuce\" is based on the French word \"deux\", meaning two, when two people are on the same points. 54,250 tennis balls are used during the Championships period. Yellow tennis balls were used for the first time in 1986. Traditionally Wimbledon fans eat strawberries and cream throughout the competition. A whopping 28,000 kg of strawberries and 7,000 litres of cream are supplied for each Wimbledon Championship. The fastest Wimbledon serve of all time was delivered by Taylor Dent in 2010 - it clocked an amazing 148mph! Seeds - The people expected to do well in a tournament. Set - The main sections of a tennis match (see how to score, above). Straight sets - When someone wins a match without losing a set, eg winning three sets to love. Love - A tennis word for zero. Forehand - When you hit with the palm of your hand facing to the front. Backhand - A shot with the  back of your hand facing front. Deuce - This is another way of saying forty-all. It comes from the French word \"deux\", meaning two, when two people are on the same point. Baseline - This is the line at the far end of the court.

The small island in the Pacific is home to an important strategic US airbase, US nuclear bombers and about 6,000 troops along with some 165,000 civilians. It's a US territory, so an attack on Guam would be an attack on the US. The Guamanian authorities were quick to say there was nothing to fear from North Korea's angry rhetoric. \"I want to reassure the people of Guam that currently there is no threat to our island,\" Governor Eddie Baza Calvo said in a statement on Facebook, adding that the island was \"prepared for any eventuality\". But it has left many on the tourism-reliant island concerned. \"Yes, of course people are worried,\" front desk manager at a local hotel, Adele, told the BBC. \"It is scary to think that there is a threat from North Korea on Guam.\" Local stand-up comedian Chris \"Malafunkshun\" Barnett said there was a real level of anxiety: \"There have been threats before but this time feels different. \"We're really in caught in the cross fire. President Trump seems as much of a sabre-rattler as Kim Jong-un in Pyongyang. \"And a lot of people here feel like Trump is the guy who might actually press the button.\" The story is all over the local media on Guam, adding to the nervousness of the residents. \"We should all prepare for whatever happens,\" Adele suggested, adding that she planned to stock up on food after work, in case the crisis escalated. \"Many people are taking such precautions. We're keeping an eye on the news and we're all praying that the military will help us.\" Isa Baza, a local television reporter, said the authorities believe it would take about 14 to 15 minutes for a North Korean missile to reach Guam. \"And so, that's not a lot of time to respond,\" she told the BBC. But Ms Baza added that the Guam Homeland Security Office \"did say that if there were any threat they would put out a mass public notification via the emergency broadcasting system\". It is not the first time the small island has found itself named as a potential target for North Korean rockets - aside from US military bases in South Korea or Japan, the Pacific island is the closest target for Pyongyang should the regime want to attack the US. Congresswoman for Guam Madeleine Z Bordallo said in a statement the most recent threat was \"dangerous and it further heightens tensions in our region\". She went on to criticise President Trump for his \"unhelpful\" tweeting on the matter and \"strongly urged\" him to \"explore every avenue\" to peacefully respond. But while local media are citing many residents sharing the heightened concern, not everyone is fazed by the situation. \"It's not a big deal,\" Cathleen Viray, another hotel worker, told the BBC. End of Twitter post  by @MALAFUNKSHUN She pointed out that such threats were not new and that people had been living with this situation for a couple of years already. Local dive instructor Yuka, who caters mostly for Japanese tourists, agreed with her. People were concerned, she said, but said she herself was not too worried. \"There's a sense of resignation among many people here,\" Mr Barnett agrees. \"After all, we're talking about a possible nuclear strike here. \"But I think this is moving too far too fast - and that we haven't really given diplomacy a chance yet.\"",

Left Unity said Labour should be \"thrilled\" so many people want to join rather than focusing on \"people who it thinks are too left wing\". It comes after The Times reported \"infiltration\" of the contest to replace Ed Miliband by the \"hard left\". Labour says it has a \"robust system\" to prevent \"malicious applications\". Ballot papers have not yet been sent out in the leadership contest, which pits Mr Corbyn against Yvette Cooper, Liz Kendall and Andy Burnham. Labour says the verification process is ongoing, and has refuted claims the leadership contest is being infiltrated by those who do not support the party. Acting leader Harriet Harman emailed MPs this week with a list of new members from their constituencies, asking them to check for any suspicious names. As well as regular members, people can sign up as registered supporters for \u00c2\u00a33 and take part in the vote. They are asked to confirm they \"support the aims and values of the Labour Party\". The Times reported 18 members of Left Unity, a left-wing party founded by film director Ken Loach which fielded 10 candidates at the general election, had registered. At-a-glance profiles of the four contenders Left Unity principal speaker Salman Shaheen said: \"Left Unity is a party with many disaffected former Labour members. It's no wonder that some people genuinely wanted to have a say in the Labour leadership contest. \"They fully agree with the aims and values of the Labour Party - it's the Labour leadership who abandoned those values.\" Mr Shaheen said it was \"ludicrous\" to refer to its supports as \"entryists\", a term used when members of a political group infiltrate another in order to subvert its policies. \"The surge for Corbyn is a genuine popular movement that the Blairites can't stop,\" Mr Shaheen added. \"It's not about us - they found just 18 Left Unity members out of the tens of thousands who have signed up to support Jeremy Corbyn's anti-austerity, true Labour politics.\" Labour said: \"All applications to join the Labour Party as a member, affiliate or supporter are verified and those who are identified by our verification team as being candidates, members or supporters of another political party will be denied a vote.\" The apparent success of Mr Corbyn's campaign has prompted a row within the party, with other candidates saying a Labour Party led by him could not win an election. But Conservative London mayor Boris Johnson said his party should \"pay attention\" to some of the things said by the Islington North MP, suggesting some of his analysis was \"not wholly wrong\". \"Yes, there is a problem of inequality. Yes, there is a problem of low pay,\" he said during an event in central London. He added: \"I happen to think his solutions are completely wrong and he would take the Labour Party in radically the wrong direction. \"But it would be very complacent and wrong to ignore the truth of some of the observations he is making about ways in which society could be better. We should be humble about that.\"",

Bruce Adamson also called on ministers to gather accurate data on the number of children who go hungry because they do not have access to free meals during school holidays. About 255,230 pupils are registered for free school meals in Scotland. The government said it was \"taking steps\" to measure food insecurity. Mr Adamson paid tribute to charities such as the Trussell Trust, which has begun a pilot project in Glasgow to offer cookery lessons to parents struggling to make ends meet during the holidays. He told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"There shouldn't be stigma attached to having basic rights to food. \"The obligation is on the state to make sure that every child in Scotland is getting access to the food, the education, the healthcare, everything that they need. And that shouldn't be a problem in the holidays. \"The more support we can provide to the Trussell Trust and to all of the different programmes right across Scotland at community level that are delivering these important rights for children, the better.\" He added: \"It is a particular challenge over the holidays, which should be a time of joy and excitement and fun, but actually it is the most challenging time of the year for many families in Scotland facing poverty.\" The Scottish government introduced free school meals for all children in primary 1-3 in 2015. Since then, more than 77% of the 173,000 five to seven-year-olds that are registered take up the option of a free meal at school. However, the numbers registered falls significantly for subsequent age groups, with only 39,215 registered in P4-7 and 38,841 secondary school pupils entitled to a free meal during term time. A Scottish government spokeswoman said that no child should be going hungry and that tackling inequality was a key government priority. She added: \"Local authorities have the flexibility to provide meals to children outwith term time and some chose to use this flexibility during school holidays by providing holiday lunch clubs. \"In addition, we have already invested over \u00c2\u00a3350m in welfare mitigation measures, in addition to our \u00c2\u00a31m Fair Food Fund, which supports projects that promote dignity and harness the social potential of food to connect people and develop sustainable solutions to food poverty.\" She acknowledged that more work was needed to measure the numbers of children thought to be going hungry. She said: \"The Scottish government has therefore taken steps to better measure the full range of food insecurity in Scotland. \"Three questions on food insecurity in Scotland will be included in the Scottish Health Survey 2017. Thereafter, the full United Nations food insecurity question set will be included in the SHS from 2018 onwards. \"This will allow internationally comparable baseline data on food insecurity in Scotland to be available in 2019 with further data sets available annually thereafter.\"",

        "article": "So how has George Osborne pulled off the magical trick of maintaining spending on the police, imposing smaller than anticipated departmental spending cuts in general, and performing an expensive u-turn on tax-credit reductions, while remaining seemingly on course to turn this year's \u00a374bn deficit into a \u00a310bn surplus in 2020. Well, it is because the government's forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, has increased its prognosis of how much the Treasury will raise from existing taxes (not new ones) and reduced what it thinks the chancellor will shell out in interest on its massive debts. In total the OBR thinks the national debt, the aggregate of the annual deficits, will be \u00a323bn lower over the four years to 2020, and just because it is more optimistic about tax revenues and assorted costs. Or to put it another way, George Osborne is today \u00a323bn better off than he thought in July, and without doing anything at all. Windfall So what is the chancellor doing with this very useful \u00a323bn that the OBR has found at the back of the sofa? Well he is using \u00a319bn of it to cover the \u00a34.4bn annual cost of not slashing tax credits, and making about \u00a38bn a year less than expected in departmental savings. So on paper it looks as though the chancellor is actually being a bit more prudent than he was in July, even though some would say he is expensively moving his party nearer to the centre-ground of British politics - which he thinks has been vacated by Jeremy Corbyn's Labour. To labour the point, George Osborne is not deploying quite all of his windfall to buy off his critics by taking the teeth out of austerity. But that does not mean there is no risk for him. The OBR's fiscal optimism could well be misplaced - especially since only last week we saw government borrowing figures hideously worse than expected. But presumably, if tax revenues turn out lower and interest payments higher than the chancellor is now banking on, he can attempt to blame and kick the forecasting agency, the OBR, which he created. And he'll hope, presumably, that voters won't see double standards in his years of bashing his Labour predecessors for spending tax revenues that never looked sustainable. George Osborne has not quite morphed into his former opposite number, Ed Balls. But he is, in a more Ballsian way, counting on economic recovery to mend his overstretched finances. UPDATE 20:21 I have had a quick word with Robert Chote of the OBR, and he says that even if he had seen October's lamentable borrowing figures he would not have changed his deficit projections. His expectation is that revenues will rise for the government because of measures already taken, but which have not yet led to a higher tax yield.",

Sion Davies, 25, died after falling off a balcony at Anthony Munkley's Caia Park estate flat in Wrexham last October.

His wife, Gwenythe Munkley, 55, denies helping her husband evade arrest. Mr Munkley admitted having a drug problem since the age of 12 and said he was \"addicted\", but denied owing Mr Davies money.

Mr Munkley said he had \"absolutely nothing\" to do with the murder, blaming it on \"a Geordie man\". He said he left the flat while that man fought Mr Davies.

An unsolicited email from Apple inviting publishers to join the service presumes acceptance of the terms, unless they actively opt out. It requires them to cover Apple if legal issues arise, among other things. Apple, which is due to launch the app later this year, refused to comment on the row. The terms read: \"If we receive a legal claim about your RSS content, we will tell you so that you can resolve the issue, including indemnifying Apple if Apple is included in the claim.\" Agreement to that, and other terms, is a prerequisite for being included in the forthcoming app. However, a line in the email from Apple made clear that publishers not wishing to be bound by them would be expected to say so explicitly. That has led some to express concern that they would be bound by the agreement perhaps without ever having seen it or actively consenting to it. Other terms in the email allow Apple to place adverts next to publishers' publicly available content without paying them. The BBC has spoken to three online publishers about the move. One of them, Mike Ash said he thought it was \"wrong of Apple\" to presume that he would indemnify them. He said the email was \"presumptuous\". And, in a blogpost entitled I Do Not Agree To Your Terms, he took issue with the requirement to opt out. He wrote: \"Let me get this straight, Apple: you send me an email outlining the terms under which you will redistribute my content, and you will just assume that I agree to your terms unless I opt out? \"You're going to consider me bound to terms you just declared to me in an email as long as I don't respond? That's completely crazy. You don't even know if I received the email!\" According to Graham Hann, the head of technology, media and communications at the law firm Taylor Wessing, the terms of the deal are broadly in line with industry standards - except the requirement to opt out. \"The content of the notice is not unusual, although it has deliberately been dumbed down, possibly for clarity,\" he told the BBC. \"However, the optout approach is very unusual and I don't see how the notice could form a binding contract without a positive reply. \"Apple clearly wants to launch with as much content as possible and has taken this risk-based approach. Some publishers may object and even threaten to sue. \"However, I think it would be hard to claim damage beyond a reasonable royalty fee.\" Apple will place the publishers' content via a publicly available RSS feed, which sends any updates to a blog or website to the host - in this case, Apple News. Publishers make these feeds publicly available voluntarily. After announcing the launch of the app, the company began advertising for editorial staff to work on it, indicating that it would be curated by a human editor, rather than an algorithm. The news app is categorised as part of the firm's marketing department. It is due to be launched with the latest operating system update - iOS9 - later in 2015.

        "article": "The Serious Fraud Office has been urged to reconsider its decision not to investigate allegations of Fifa corruption during the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bidding process. Conservative MP Damian Collins made the call after US media claims that former Fifa executive Chuck Blazer recorded conversations with football officials at the London 2012 Olympics. Russia will host the 2018 World Cup after England's unsuccessful bid. The 2022 World Cup will be in Qatar. The SFO can investigate \"cases which undermine UK commercial/financial PLC in general and the City of London in particular\" and has been following bribery claims stemming from the December 2010 decision to award rights for the next two World Cups. Fifa has already undertaken its own investigation into the corruption allegations, led by independent ethics investigator Michael Garcia. American Blazer was a member of Fifa's executive committee from 1996 to 2013. On Sunday, the New York Daily News alleged US FBI agents recruited Blazer by threatening him with arrest and prosecution for tax fraud if he failed to cooperate. Media playback is not supported on this device The paper says Blazer was supplied with a modified keyring that contained a tiny microphone in order to secretly record conversations with leading football officials during a visit to the London 2012 Olympic Games. \"If there is evidence that Chuck Blazer held meetings during the Olympics, that would come under the jurisdiction of the SFO,\" Collins told BBC Sport. \"I want to see if they would now be prepared to act.\" Fifa declined to comment about Blazer when contacted. BBC Sport has seen a letter from the SFO to Collins, sent before the allegations about Blazer were published, which said the crime bureau was watching corruption allegations \"with interest\". The letter added that the SFO did not believe it had the right to launch its own inquiry. SFO director David Green told Collins: \"The allegations that have occurred so far are against non-UK nationals and the alleged conduct took place outside of the UK.\" That could now change if reports of Blazer recording officials in London are accurate. Green's letter adds: \"I can... assure you that the SFO will continue to keep the jurisdictional position under review.\" Collins wrote to the SFO in September asking it to seek access to the report produced by Michael Garcia. Garcia spent 18 months interviewing individuals from nations wanting to stage the 2018 and 2022 finals - and wants greater transparency from Fifa. But Fifa president Sepp Blatter said Garcia's full report will not be published because of legal issues. The information that will be eventually be revealed is now in the hands of Hans-Joachim Eckert, a German judge tasked by Fifa with deciding if any individuals breached the organisation's code of ethics. He is due to make an interim statement later this month, which may include redacted sections of Garcia's findings. Collins is concerned that information relating to claims made by former chairman of the FA Lord Triesman concerning alleged corruption could be contained within Garcia's files but will not be made public. Lord Triesman made a series of allegations concerning his time involved with England's 2018 bid in evidence to a House of Lords committee in 2011. Furthermore, Collins asked the SFO to consider whether evidence of any additional wrongdoing, which might fall under its jurisdiction, could be revealed by obtaining access to Garcia's report. In light of the SFO's response and Chuck Blazer's alleged role as an FBI informant, Collins believes Fifa must now publish Garcia's findings and inform the relevant law enforcement agencies. \"If Fifa is sitting on evidence relating to acts of bribery and corruption, then it is more than just a football matter,\" Collins said. \"It is unthinkable they wouldn't reveal what they have. \"There are people who are stopping evidence being made available. You'll have to draw your own conclusions as to why that is.\"",

        "article": "An author tracked down a teenager in Fife and hit her over the head with a bottle after she gave his book a bad review, a court has heard. Richard Brittain, a former champion on the TV programme Countdown, travelled from England and used Facebook to find Paige Rolland, 18, at her work. He admitted assaulting Miss Rolland with a bottle to her severe injury on 3 October 2014 at Asda, Glenrothes. Sheriff Martin Jones deferred sentence until a later date. A motion for bail was refused. Glasgow Sheriff Court heard Brittain uploaded part of a published book of his called The World Rose onto a website called Wattpad, where people can read and critique literature written by others. Miss Rolland read the excerpt of Brittain's book and left comments about it. Procurator fiscal depute Harry Findlay said: \"The complainer had read some of that material and gave feedback of what she thought to be the merits or otherwise of the book. \"The feedback was negative. What followed were comments made by the accused which give an indication that he was displeased.\" In October last year, Brittain went to the Asda store Miss Rolland worked in after she began her shift. Mr Findlay said: \"He went to the alcohol aisle and picked up a bottle of wine, he then went to the aisle where the complainer was working. \"He approached her from behind, she was kneeling down collecting cereal from the bottom shelf of the aisle. \"While doing so, the accused approached without warning, any provocation or words and he struck the complainer on the back of the head with the bottle. \"One blow. It made contact and the wound bled immediately and she had a moment of unconsciousness.\" Miss Rolland was taken to hospital suffering from a cut to her head and treated for a head injury. The court also heard that a month before the attack on Miss Roland, Brittain stalked a university classmate, Ella Durant, 23, who moved from London to Glasgow. He used her Twitter and Instagram accounts to find where she worked and turned up on two occasions to speak to her. Brittain, whose address was given as Palgrave, Bedford, pled guilty to engaging in a course of conduct which caused Miss Durant fear or alarm by repeatedly pursuing her, approaching her, following her and publishing a story about stalking her in September 2014. Defence counsel Michael Meehan told the court that in relation to the message from Brittain to Miss Rolland after she criticised his work, his client pointed out she had not read the published version and asked her to remove her comments. The court was told he also contacted her in September this year with an apologetic message.",

        "article": "Nineteen people, including 17 foreign tourists, have been killed in a gun attack on the Bardo museum in the Tunisian capital, Tunis, the PM says. Those killed included citizens from Japan, Italy, Colombia, Australia, France, Poland and Spain, PM Habib Essid said. Two Tunisians, one a police officer, were also killed, he said. Security forces killed two gunmen and were searching the surrounding area for accomplices, Mr Essid added. At the time of the attack, deputies in the neighbouring parliamentary building were discussing anti-terrorism legislation. Parliament was evacuated. Following the attack, Mr Essid said: \"It is a critical moment in our history, and a defining moment for our future. \"We have not established the identity of the two terrorists... Reports are not final, these two terrorists could have been assisted by two or three other operatives.\" Security operations were \"still under way\", he added. According to Prime Minister Essid, 19 people were killed, although some of the countries involved have different totals: Earlier reports said that a total of 20 tourists had died, with at least 22 tourists and two Tunisians injured. Other reports suggest up to 50 could have been hurt. Italian, Polish, South African, French and Japanese tourists were among the injured, Mosaique FM radio reported. Parliament held an extraordinary session on Wednesday evening. Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi said: \"We are in a war against terrorism... we will fight them without mercy.\" Analysis: BBC Security Correspondent Frank Gardner Sadly, this attack did not come out of the blue. While Tunisia has been spared the catastrophic levels of violence that have plagued other Arab Spring countries like Syria, Yemen and Libya, the country has still suffered from occasional but deadly attacks carried out by Islamist extremists. In 2013, 22 people were killed. This included a suicide bomber who attacked a beach resort in Sousse. Last year 45 people were killed and already this year the death toll has reached 23, with Wednesday's museum raid following an attack on a mountain checkpoint in February that killed 4 police officers. In all cases the perpetrators are believed to be jihadists. Tunisian fighters make up a disproportionately high number of foreign recruits to Islamic State (IS) in Syria. More than 3,000 have joined, earning themselves a reputation for ferocity both on and off the battlefield. At the scene: BBC's Naveena Kottoor in Tunis The last group of foreign tourists left the Bardo museum by bus under the watch of the Tunisian security forces and hundreds of bystanders. Traffic is flowing again, but bystanders are still here. One man told me he had come out of sadness and shock. The attack struck at both the political and economic heart of Tunisia. The museum is to many Tunisians what the Louvre is to Paris - a major tourist destination. This kind of attack on civilians is new here - the last time something similar happened was in 2002. As an act of defiance and national unity, Tunisian politicians are returning to parliament on Wednesday evening. But many Tunisians had hoped that 2015 would bring a more prosperous and stable future. Tunisia's militant Islamists: How big a threat? Anti-terror demonstrations were reported in central Tunis on Wednesday, with crowds waving flags and condemning the attack. A museum employee told Reuters the two attackers \"opened fire on the tourists as they were getting off the buses before fleeing into the museum\". Eyewitness Yasmine Ryan told the BBC she saw \"helicopters flying overhead\" and \"tanks rolling in\" as the security situation unfolded. The attack is a huge blow for Tunisia's tourism industry and its government, which only emerged at the end of a long political transition several months ago, the BBC's Arab affairs editor Sebastian Usher says. Islamist militants have tried to derail the democratic transition, which, although fragile, remains the most positive result of the Arab Spring in the Middle East, our correspondent adds. EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini offered her condolences (in French) to the victims' families, and said the EU would \"fully support Tunisia in the fight against terrorism\". US Secretary of State John Kerry said the US \"stands with the Tunisian people at this difficult time\" and would continue to support the government's \"efforts to advance a secure, prosperous, and democratic Tunisia\". Tourism is a key sector of Tunisia's economy, with large numbers of Europeans visiting the country's resorts. In 2002, 19 people, including 11 German tourists, were killed in a bomb blast at a synagogue in the resort of Djerba. Al-Qaeda said it had carried out that attack. Concerns about security in Tunisia have increased in recent months as neighbouring Libya has become increasingly unstable. A large number of Tunisians have also left to fight in Syria and Iraq, triggering worries that returning militants could carry out attacks at home.",

        "article": "Back in the 1970s, when I first lived in Latin America and was hooked by a fascination for this region that has never left, virtually every country here was ruled by a military dictatorship. They were brutal, inhuman regimes led by men with notorious reputations for violence and suppressing opposition - Augusto Pinochet in Chile, Alfredo Stroessner in Paraguay, Jorge Rafael Videla in Argentina and so on. One of the great success stories across the region, in the intervening three or four decades, was how most of those dictatorships were driven out - usually by the overwhelming force of peaceful, popular pressure - and were replaced by elected democratic governments. The general consensus among observers, politicians and the Latin American public is that democracy is here to stay. That is certainly the case here in Brazil, a country that has grown into one of the world's top 10 economies, where vigorous political debate is the everyday norm and where, since the return of civilian rule in 1985, the army's place has unquestionably been back in the barracks. So, even in these times of social unrest and economic crisis in Brazil, there is no real threat of military intervention. But many people are describing the removal of the country's first female leader as a coup, albeit one carried out by politicians rather than generals. That is certainly how Dilma Rousseff herself sees things after a vote in the country's senate triggered her dismissal over charges that she illegally manipulated government accounts to hide the scale of the budget deficit. For Ms Rousseff the experience was not as physically painful as the torture and abuse she suffered as a prisoner under the former dictatorship, but she felt just as keenly a sense of injustice and abuse of power. Dilma Rousseff vigorously denied the charges which in the great scheme of things could be characterised as relatively minor. She has repeatedly described the process as a plot by her political opponents to force her from office, replacing without an election a leftist, socialist government with a centre-right, market-friendly alternative. In other words, say Ms Rousseff and her supporters also believe it was a coup. But if the term \"coup\" describes a sudden and illegal seizure of power, that is arguably not what happened in Brazil. Dilma Rousseff's removal was a long drawn-out legal affair, overseen by the country's Supreme Court. Impeachment is a provision laid out in the Brazilian constitution, as it is in many other democracies. As flimsy or irrelevant as many thought the charges were, the [now] former president was able to defend herself by legal argument and with counsel throughout. The law might be an ass, but it is still the law. Dilma Rousseff has never been formally accused of corruption or self-enrichment, unlike many of the men who have sat in judgment over her in the Brazilian Congress during the recent turbulent weeks and months. Nor has she been implicated in the wide-ranging \"car wash\" corruption scandal, involving the payment of billions of dollars in bribes in relation to contracts at the state controlled oil giant, Petrobras. Several senior politicians, including members of Ms Rousseff's own Workers Party, have been ensnared in the scandal. One widely-held belief is that the overriding concern for Brazil's well-heeled political elite is to find a way of shutting down or, emasculating, the corruption investigation before it goes any deeper. Fernando Gabeira, once a left-wing senator but who now commentates on Brazilian politics says what has happened is \"good for Brazil\". \"The rules were obeyed, the constitution was considered and it means that Brazil's democracy will be stronger than before.\" Others, including Gleisi Hoffman, a former minister in the last Rousseff government disagree. She described the removal of a democratically elected leader as  \"a sordid and lamentable affair\". Dilma Rousseff's biggest mistake, and perhaps the real reason that she was impeached, was her unwillingness or inability to make the deals and alliances necessary to run an effective government in Brazil's fractured multi-party system. Her last two years in office have been plagued by an economy in recession, rising inflation and unemployment. Brazilians have become worried that many of the gains made in the first 10 years of Workers Party rule could be lost under her stewardship, in stark contrast to the years of plenty, fuelled by high oil prices, overseen by her more charismatic, politically astute and but perhaps less scrupulous predecessor, President Lula da Silva. In the shape of Ms Rousseff's replacement and former deputy, Michel Temer, Brazil now has a centre-right president who has promised to protect the popular social programmes introduced by the Rousseff/Lula governments. But, vowing to get the country's broken economy back on track, Mr Temer is also looking to cut government budgets and change priorities. It is a familiar conundrum and within an hour of being sworn in, the new leader was flying to China for the G-20 summit. Brazilian democracy has been damaged and sullied in the eyes of many by what happened in Brasilia. Back-stabbing, betrayal and the ever-present spectre of corruption? Yes.  But a coup?  Probably not.",

        "article": "Scottish Cup holders Hibernian demolished Bonnyrigg Rose at Tynecastle to ease into the fifth round. Andrew Shinnie, James Keatings and Chris Humphrey banged in three goals inside 13 first-half minutes. The Midlothian junior side had a moment to celebrate when Dean Hoskins converted a penalty. The one-way traffic continued in the second half with Jason Cummings scoring twice, while Lewis Stevenson, Keatings and Jordon Forster were also on target. The opening 10 minutes were evenly matched but a goalkeeping error gifted Hibs their opener and it encouraged the Leith side to go on a three-goal blitz at the home of their arch-rivals Hearts. Shinnie's 22-yard shot looked like it would be dealt with comfortably by Michael Andrews, but the low effort squirmed through his grasp and into the bottom right corner. Bonnyrigg's 5000-strong support remained noisy before Keatings' delightful strike into the top left corner punctured their enthusiasm. Goalkeeper Andrews could do nothing about that one and all of a sudden the pressure was on the underdogs not to fold, but a third Hibs goal followed soon after. Andrews palmed Stevenson's low shot into the path of Humphrey for the winger to stroke home an easy first goal of his Hibs career. Manager Robbie Horn signalled to his players to be big and to stand up to Hibs' dominance, and left-back Ruaridh Donaldson impressed under pressure on more than one occasion before playing a useful ball to Kieran McGachie. Forster fouled the ambling blonde forward and referee Alan Muir pointed to the spot. Dean Hoskins sent Hibs' substitute goalkeeper Ross Laidlaw the wrong way and all of a sudden the Rosey Posey's support rediscovered their fervour, flags and volume. Another shout for a penalty from a Forster handball, as well as Wayne McIntosh's header wide gave the New Dundas Park side some hope of scoring a second, but Neil Lennon's side also remained a threat and Hoskins had to be smart to clear off the line before the break. Media playback is not supported on this device Hibernian quickly killed off any thoughts of an unlikely comeback with Cummings' scissor-kick and Stevenson's back post tap-in well and truly wrapping the result up by the hour mark. Bonnyrigg were broken further by Cummings' second strike of the game - an easy finish when Andrews could only parry an effort from Grant Holt. Then Keatings completed his brace by converting into the far corner from a tight angle following Martin Boyle's through ball. The rout was complete when Forster got in the scoring act by heading home Keatings' free-kick after a reckless foul by Hoskins on Humphrey. A chastening experience on the day for Bonnyrigg but one they only experienced because of a terrific run in the competition. Hibernian's Neil Lennon: \"The attitude was great and that will give the players a lift. Overall, I'm very pleased and the most important thing is that we are in the next round. \"It was a good day. Unfortunately, we lost our goalkeeper early [Ofir Marciano after a collision], so we are waiting to hear the results of that and we're hoping it's not too bad.\" Bonnyrigg's Robbie Horn: \"We just didn't start the game and we gave away some poor goals. I know we are better than that. \"We showed in spells what we are capable of at 3-0 and I thought there was a good shout for another penalty to go 3-2. \"The way Hibs moved the ball was different class.\" Match ends, Bonnyrigg Rose 1, Hibernian 8.

Security camera footage showed the suspect taking a weapon out of his backpack and shooting. Israeli security forces have launched a massive manhunt for the gunman, cordoning off areas of the city. The incident took place in Dizengoff Street, a busy part of the city centre filled with bars and cafes. It was not immediately clear what motivated the shooting, which follows a wave of Palestinian attacks against Israelis over the past few months. Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld told the BBC: \"It's not clear what the background of the incident is, if it's a terrorist attack or if it's criminal-related.\" Four of the wounded had suffered serious injuries, he said. Undercover units and counter-terrorism units were working in different areas of Tel Aviv, Mr Rosenfeld said, adding that no specific warning of an attack had been received. Israeli media are reporting that the attacker has been identified as an Israeli Arab from northern Israel. The Times of Israel reported, citing police sources, that his father had recognised his son in security footage and called police. While 1 January is not New Year's Day in the Jewish state, Friday afternoon would be the peak of the weekend and this was a party area of Tel Aviv. The city tends to be slightly more remote from the political tensions and violence affecting other parts of Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories. There has been speculation that if the bar was popular with the gay community, it may have been a hate crime. It remains a possibility that there was some kind of link to organised crime. But until the perpetrator is captured, it is not clear what the motive may have been. A spokesman for the Israeli ambulance service, Zaki Heller, said people inside and outside the bar had been hit: \"Some of the wounded were inside the pub. Three of them were lying unconscious and the rest were on the sidewalk [pavement],\" he said. Footage from a neighbouring food store shows the gunman - who appears to be a young man, wearing protective glasses or sunglasses, and dressed in dark clothes - choosing dried fruits or nuts. Moments later, he returns the items, gets an assault rifle out of his bag, leaves the shop and can be seen opening fire from near the doorway. He is believed to have made off on foot. Afterwards, broken glass could be seen on the pavement outside the bar and a nearby cafe which was also targeted. Osnat David, who owns a nearby hair ,said she and her customers had hidden while the shooting took place. \"We were shaking,\" she said. \"There were about eight of us, hiding in the storage room.\" The shooting took place at around 15:00 local time (13:00 GMT) on Friday. As of 23 December, at least 21 Israelis had been killed in the recent violence, most of them in stabbings and shooting attacks by Palestinians. At least 131 Palestinians have also been killed. More than half were said by Israel to be attackers. Others have been killed in clashes with Israeli forces.",

A third person had been arrested in the raid in Verviers and weapons are reported to have been recovered. Prosecutor Eric Van Der Sypt told reporters police had targeted a group returning from Syria who had been about to launch attacks in a matter of hours. Suspects had opened fire on police, he said. There were also overnight searches in the Brussels area. Speaking after Thursday's raids in Verviers, Mr Van Der Sypt said: \"The suspects immediately and for several minutes opened fire with military weaponry and handguns on the special units of the federal police before they were neutralised.\" After the raid, four Kalashnikovs, bomb-making equipment and police clothing were found, according to local media. Security forces remain in the Verviers area. Anti-terror raids also took place late on Thursday in Brussels and surrounding towns, including Sint-Jans-Molenbeek, Anderlecht and Schaerbeek. Earlier on Thursday two suspected Islamists were arrested in the Brussels suburb of Zaventem, local media reported. Belgian officials say more than 300 people have left Belgium to fight with Islamic militant groups in Syria and Iraq. Belgian journalist Mark Eeckhaut told the BBC the suspects in Verviers had wanted to attack a police station and cause a large number of casualties. The terror threat level in Belgium has been raised to three - the second highest, Mr Van Der Sypt said. Witnesses in Verviers reported hearing heavy gunfire for several minutes and at least three explosions. Witness Marylou Fletcher told the BBC: \"We were going back from shopping and saw the police cars. We thought there was an accident then we heard something blowing up. There were a lot of gunshots. \"My children cried. They are just terrified.\" The area around the train station has been cordoned off and reports on social media say there is a heavy police presence in the town centre. Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel later said the security operation \"shows the government's determination to fight those who want to spread terror\", his spokesman said. British Prime Minister David Cameron said events in Belgium \"look like yet another indication of the huge risk we face from Islamist extremist terror in Europe\". \"We have to remain extremely vigilant, we have to take all the steps we can to beat this evil,\" he told reporters in Washington where he is to hold talks with President Barack Obama. Verviers is in the province of Liege, close to the German border, and has a population of about 56,000. The incident comes a week after attacks in neighbouring France that killed 17 people. Belgian media has reported that some of the weapons used in those attacks were bought in Brussels. Mr Van Der Sypt said no weapons link with the killings in France had been established. However there are fears that the suspects captured or killed in this operation could have been inspired by the killings in France to accelerate their own plans, the BBC's Chris Morris in Verviers says. The attacks in and around Paris - on satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, a kosher market and police - have heightened security fears in several European countries.

Media playback is not supported on this device Rogers needed 14 stitches in his lip after a challenge by Tyrone's Tiernan McCann at the start of the game. \"I think Brendan was quite shocked. Some people were quite horrified,\" said the Derry manager. \"I'll leave it to other people to make up their minds.\" The Slaughtneil man had the stitches inserted last Sunday and Barton expects Rogers to be out of action for a couple of more weeks. Rogers was named at midfield for the McKenna Cup final and the match video suggested he may have been caught by McCann's right elbow immediately after challenging for the initial throw-in. After the ball was thrown in, McCann came in from the side and the footage showed the Tyrone man clattering into Rogers although the Red Hand county player appeared to be focusing on the ball rather than the Derry midfielder when the contact was made. \"Brendan has been very quiet about it and we have been very quiet about it as well,\" said Barton after Derry's opening 3-13 to 1-10 Division 2 Football League victory over Fermanagh at Celtic Park. \"It was quite an horrific incident. I wouldn't like to expand on it to be quite frank.

We turned over a serious amount of ball under no pressure. \"I was glad to see our first goal going in (before half-time) and I was very happy to see half-time because it gave us an opportunity to restructure and talk about what we felt we were going wrong. \"Getting in the ball in early in the second half to our men inside worked nicely in the inclement conditions but we'll have to up our performances over the next couple of weeks.\"",

A total of 304 people, mostly school students, were killed when the ship - which was overloaded and illegally redesigned - sank off Jindo island. The government has faced a day of anger with relatives cancelling at least one memorial service in protest. Divers have recovered all but nine of the bodies. Relatives say the ship must be raised and their remains found. The government says salvaging the ship will cost $110m (\u00c2\u00a374m) and has previously refused to commit to doing so. But President Park Guen-hye, speaking at a port in Jindo, said she would take \"the necessary steps to salvage the ship at the earliest possible date\". South Korea's National Assembly adopted a resolution saying a speedy recovery of the ferry would help heal \"the minds of the victims, survivors and bereaved families... as well as those of all the citizens\". But relatives of the missing students had said there were not convinced that the Sewol would definitely be raised, the BBC's Stephen Evans in Seoul reports. They remain wary of the plan, and called Ms Park's announcement vague and politically motivated. Steve Evans, BBC News, Seoul: Even as President Park gave the bereaved families what they had been asking for, she must have felt their wrath and their grief. Dressed in the black of mourning, she stood on a windy breakwater near where the Sewol sank and announced that the vessel would be raised - just as the families had demanded. \"I have a heavy heart and my heart aches to think how painful it is,\" she says. But bereaved families had left the port before she arrived, a gesture the South Korean media interpreted as a protest against what the families allege is her previous inaction over both the raising of the Sewol and fulfilling the promise of an independent enquiry. Demands for answers go on How can ferry be raised? Memorial ceremonies are being held across the country on Thursday. But relatives cancelled a planned service in the city of Ansan in protest against Ms Park's absence from the event. In the morning, Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo was prevented from entering the venue by relatives of those who died. Investigators say the ferry sank after an inexperienced crew member made too fast a turn. The combination of an illegal redesign and overload meant the ship was unstable. But some relatives say they want an independent and more thorough inquiry into the disaster, which sparked countrywide debate about regulatory failings and official incompetence. Most of the crew of the Sewol survived. The captain and three senior crew members have since been given long jail terms for failing to protect passengers. Eleven other crew members were imprisoned, as was the captain of the a coast guard vessel involved in the botched rescue effort. Separate trials were held for employees of the ferry operator, Chonghaejin Marine Co. Its owner, Yoo Byung-eun, disappeared after the disaster and was eventually found dead.

Galvani Bioelectronics hopes to bring a new treatment based on the technique before regulators within seven years. GlaxoSmithKline and Verily, formerly Google, Life Sciences, are behind it. Animal experiments have attached tiny silicone cuffs, containing electrodes, around a nerve and then used a power supply to control the nerve's messages. One set of tests suggested the approach could help treat type-2 diabetes, in which the body ignores the hormone insulin. They focused on a cluster of chemical sensors near the main artery in the neck that check levels of sugar and the hormone insulin. The sensors send their findings back to the brain, via a nerve, so the organ can coordinate the body's response to sugar in the bloodstream. GSK vice-president of bioelectronics Kris Famm told the BBC News website: \"The neural signatures in the nerve increase in type 2-diabetes. \"By blocking those neural signals in diabetic rats, you see the sensitivity of the body to insulin is restored.\" And early work suggested it could work in other diseases too. \"It isn't just a one-trick-pony, it is something that if we get it right could have a new class of therapies on our hands,\" Mr Famm said. But he said the field was only \"scratching the surface\" when it came to understanding which nerve signals have what effect in the body. Both the volume and rhythm of the nerve signals could be having an effect rather than it being a simple case of turning the nerve on or off. And even if the approach works theoretically, a huge amount of effort will be needed to make the technology practical. The kits to hack the nerves will need to be miniaturised, customisable to different patients' nerves, durable enough to survive in the body long-term and have sufficient battery power. Dr Famm added: \"In 10 to 20 years I think there will be a set of these miniaturised precision therapies that will be available for you and me when we go to a doctor.\" Verily chief technology officer Brian Otis said: \"Bioelectronic medicine is a new area of therapeutic exploration, and we know that success will require the confluence of deep disease biology expertise and new highly miniaturised technologies. \"This partnership provides an opportunity to further Verily's mission by deploying our focused expertise in low power, miniaturised therapeutics and our data analytics engine to potentially address many disease areas with greater precision with the goal of improving outcomes.\" Follow James on Twitter.",

        "article": "A rare spat among Singapore's first family has left citizens agog and fuelled debate on how the city-state's founding father Lee Kuan Yew should be remembered. Lee, who died last year, is revered by Singaporeans, while his children are respected members of the establishment. His son, Lee Hsien Loong, is prime minister. The family had presented a united front, but that cracked in recent days when Lee Wei Ling, a prominent doctor and newspaper columnist, publicly objected to what she saw as excess in the one-year commemorations. She also accused the government - led by her brother - of exploiting his legacy for its own gain, which Prime Minister Lee has rebutted. The exchange has shocked Singaporeans - public disputes among the establishment in this tightly controlled city are extremely rare, let alone one involving the country's equivalent of the royal family or the Kennedys. It has also fed into ongoing discussions on the tricky issue of how best to remember Lee Kuan Yew, a beloved idol who hated being one. Lee's death on 23 March last year prompted a massive outpouring of grief among Singaporeans who queued for hours to pay their respects, surprising even government officials. At least 100 events were organised for the one-year anniversary, ranging from solemn ceremonies and a candlelight vigil to tree-planting and kayaking events. Wax statues of Lee - widely known as LKY - and his wife were put on public display with flowers laid at their feet, a schoolbook teaching Lee's values was launched, while some ardent fans online even claimed to have seen his face in the clouds. Two days after the anniversary, amid unease in some quarters about the commemoration's intensity, Ms Lee posted a disapproving piece on Facebook arguing that her father would have objected. \"Any veneration could have the opposite effect and lead future generations of Singaporeans to think that my father's actions were motivated by his desire for fame, or creation of a dynasty. He strove hard and determinedly in life to advance Singapore, and not for his place in history, or leaving a great legacy,\" she wrote. She later accused the government of wanting to \"glorify my father\", and alleged that a newspaper was doing the government's bidding by refusing to publish the piece unedited. The paper, The Straits Times, strongly denied her claims of censorship. In a now-deleted post of an exchange with the paper's editors, she wrote that her brother \"has no qualms abusing his power to have a commemoration just one year after LKY died... if the power that be wants to establish a dynasty, LKY's daughter will not allow LKY's name to be sullied by a dishonourable son.\" One Sunday, the prime minister  released a statement saying her accusations were \"completely untrue\", adding that his government felt the level of commemoration and activities \"were generally appropriate\". In Singapore, Lee's admirers face the dilemma of how to honour a famously unsentimental figure who sternly disapproved of any worship - he refused statues and monuments in his name, and wanted his home to be eventually knocked down to prevent it from becoming a shrine. In a 1984 interview, Lee had made clear his objections to the idea of a personality cult in Singapore, saying: \"The danger... is that when the leader dies, you are faced with the difficult problem of finding another.\" The Lee siblings' squabble has divided public opinions, with many taking to their Facebook pages to weigh in. Some agreed that the tributes bordered on the excessive and were disrespectful. \"If he doesn't want to be hero worshipped then we shouldn't no matter what Singaporeans want. LKY has already given a lot to us. Let him rest in peace,\" said commenter Mohammad Nizam Abdul Kadir. \"The best way we can remember him is to continue as a united, multi-racial, progressive country. Uphold his values and principles,\" said another called Mano Sabnani. But others argued that the round of commemoration activities was necessary for citizens, many of whom still feel a personal connection to Lee. \"I am one of the many who wanted to express my gratitude to him and also to remember him for his commitment and contributions to Singapore. I would humbly ask Ms Lee Wei Ling to at least indulge us as we miss him too,\" said Daniel Ng. Carol Sim said: \"Ms Lee has failed to understand that LKY does not belong to her alone. He belongs to the people of Singapore. We respect your choice to remember your father in your own quiet way but you certainly cannot stop the people from wanting to do more.\"",

        "article": "In March, online community Reddit killed its \"warrant canary\" - a statement on its website declaring that it had not received any secret data snooping requests from government or law enforcement agencies. While the site has remained quiet about its canary's demise, it has hosted a discussion on the subject by a group of lawyers. A warrant canary is a statement saying a company has not received secret requests for user data by government or law enforcement officers. It is named after the birds that were taken down mineshafts to alert workers to toxic gases. If the canary died in the mine the workers knew they had to leave quickly. Similarly, the existence of a warrant canary on a website indicates the \"all clear\". When it disappears, visitors might assume the website has received classified requests for data. Many websites publish a warrant canary in an effort to be transparent with visitors. The concept gained popularity after the extent of US government surveillance was revealed by whistleblower Edward Snowden. In the US, law enforcement can issue requests for user data that come with a gagging order, preventing the demand from being disclosed. Demands known as national security letters are designed to allow law enforcement agencies to conduct an investigation without interference or alerting the target. But critics say the confidential nature of national security letters, which can be issued without a court order, makes them ripe for abuse by law enforcement. Reddit, Adobe and Tumblr are among the sites that have published warrant canaries. The disappearance of a warrant canary usually only reveals that a website has received at least one secret surveillance request. They are often written in broad terms, as their legality has not been tested in court. \"The more practically useful and informative they are, the more legally risky they are too,\" said Brett Max Kaufman, a lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union. Before it was killed, Reddit's warrant canary said: \"Reddit has never received a National Security Letter, an order under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or any other classified request for user information.\" One Reddit member asked whether websites could print an individual warrant canary on every member's profile, making it immediately obvious when a specific user had been targeted by a secret request. \"The government would have a pretty strong argument in that case that the removal of the individual's canary was simply an end-run around the gag order, and that it would jeopardise the government interests in completing its investigation without interference,\" said Mr Kaufman. \"That's not to say an individualised canary could never be lawful.\" While the disappearance of a warrant canary could indicate that a company has received a classified data request, it remains possible that Reddit removed the canary to avoid a future fight over its legality. \"I strongly suspect it is the first,\" said Alex Abdo of the ACLU. \"Unless they received a national security request, nothing else would have changed between the 2014 transparency report and now. \"If they abandoned it for the second reason, Reddit likely would not have issued the very cryptic statement that they could not comment on the disappearance of the canary.\" Reddit did not respond to the BBC's request for comment. One Reddit member questioned whether the government could force a website to falsely keep its warrant canary online, disguising the existence of a national security letter. \"If the government asked a company to leave its warrant canary up (and therefore communicate something false to the public), the company would have the right to challenge any gag (under the First Amendment... or under certain provisions of the USA Freedom Act) in court,\" said Mr Kaufman. \"But if a court upheld the government's request... the public would be none the wiser, at least for some time. \"Indeed, that would be the entire objective from the government's perspective.\" When asked whether the disappearance of Reddit's canary was a cause for alarm, Mr Abdo said it was \"difficult to know\". \"It's possible that the request was very targeted and in pursuit of someone we would all agree should be investigated,\" he said. \"But we don't know the facts at this point, and we don't even know which legal authority the government was relying on. \"And we might not know either of those things for a long time.\"",

        "article": "The US space agency (Nasa) has released spectacular new images of Jupiter acquired by its Juno probe. The pictures show the swirling clouds of the gas giant at both its poles - views that no previous mission has managed to acquire in such detail. Juno captured the data last weekend as it made its first close approach to the planet since going into orbit in July. The flyby took the spacecraft just 4,200km above Jupiter's multi-coloured atmosphere. The 6MB of data downlinked to Earth from the encounter is still being analysed, but principal investigator Scott Bolton said new things were already obvious. \"First glimpse of Jupiter's north pole, and it looks like nothing we have seen or imagined before. It's bluer in colour up there than other parts of the planet, and there are a lot of storms,\" the Southwest Research Institute scientist explained in a Nasa statement. \"There is no sign of the latitudinal bands or zones and belts that we are used to - this image is hardly recognisable as Jupiter. \"We're seeing signs that the clouds have shadows, possibly indicating that the clouds are at a higher altitude than other features.\" Jonathan Nichols from the University of Leicester, UK, is a member of the Juno mission's science team. He told the BBC that his colleagues were bowled over when they first saw the pictures: \"The team's reaction was amazement. 'Look at these images; they are coming from Jupiter; we're flying over the pole for the first time!' It's just jaw-dropping.\" When the Juno probe arrived at Jupiter in July, its instruments and camera were switched off. It had to perform a critical rocket manoeuvre to get into orbit - and engineers did not want the complication of taking pretty pictures at the same time. But after successfully turning around the planet, Juno booted up its other systems, and last Saturday's return pass was the first opportunity to get a good look at the gaseous world. The probe's Jovian Infrared Auroral Mapper (JIRAM) has acquired unique views of Jupiter's southern aurora. Earth telescopes have tried but failed to get such images. And Juno's Radio/Plasma Wave Experiment (Waves) has recorded the blizzard of particles moving through the planet's super-strong magnetic field. Juno's quest is to investigate the secrets of the Solar System by explaining the origin and evolution of its biggest planet. The spacecraft's remote sensing instruments will look down into the giant's many layers and measure their composition, temperature, motion and other properties. We should finally discover whether Jupiter has a solid core or if its gas merely compresses to an ever denser state all the way to the centre. We will also get new information on the famous Great Red Spot - the colossal storm that has raged on Jupiter for hundreds of years. Juno will tell us how deep its roots go. And Dr Nichols said Jupiter was a wonderful laboratory to try to understand even more distant places. \"We can go to Jupiter and kick the tyres to see how it works, but that then gives us some insights on lots of other objects in the Universe. \"We can use Jupiter as an analogue for things like brown dwarfs and exoplanets - basically, any fast-rotating body with a magnetic field can be modelled in some way like Jupiter.\" The spacecraft is currently flying on an ellipse around Jupiter that takes 53 days to complete. Its next close approach is due on 19 October, when the probe will fire its main engine to tighten the circuit to just 14 days. This configuration will then be held until February 2018 when the spacecraft will be commanded to make a destructive dive into Jupiter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s atmosphere. By that stage, however, scientists hope to have built a formidable data-set to help answer their most pressing questions about this vast world.

Matthew Daley, 35, killed Donald Lock, on the A24 in Findon, near Worthing, last July after the 79-year-old ran into the back of his vehicle. Daley had admitted stabbing Mr Lock to death, claiming diminished responsibility. Lewes Crown Court heard Daley suffered from chronic mental health problems. The judge, Mr Justice Singh, adjourned the case for sentencing on 8 July. Mr Lock's family said the manslaughter verdict brought to a close the \"most horrific 10 months of our lives and brings some sort of justice for Dad\". However, they blamed the NHS for his death. \"This verdict effectively provides the Daley family with what they have wanted for the last few years, their son in a safe place away from harm and being treated correctly,\" the family said in a statement. \"For them they can still visit their son, hug him and talk to him and enjoy aspects of his life with him albeit constrained at the same time. \"For us all we can do is cling on to the wonderful memories of Dad. \"As a consequence of the failings of the NHS and this verdict, it is clear that Dad would still be here today if they had done their job properly.\" During the trial, jurors were told Daley's mother pleaded with mental health experts to have her son sectioned. She told the court, that the day she heard Mr Lock was killed was \"the day that all your nightmares came true\". Daley was charged with murder, but never denied killing Mr Lock. During police interview, he told detectives how he had used a knife to fatally stab Mr Lock, and while in prison awaiting trial he wrote and addressed a letter to the BBC in London, about what had happened on 16 July. The letter was seized before it was posted and was used as evidence. The great-grandfather, who had recently been given the all-clear from prostate cancer, was returning from a cycle meeting when his car crashed into the back of Daley's Ford Fusion. He and his wife Maureen had recently celebrated 55 years of marriage, and had two children.

Figures show the number of women taking their holy vows has trebled in the past five years, from 15 in 2009 to 45 last year - the highest number since 1990. Fourteen of the women who entered convents in 2014 were aged 30 or under, the latest figures show. The Church says women are being drawn to religious life because of a \"gap in the market for meaning in our culture\". Sister Cathy Jones, from the National Office for Vocation, said: \"We are never going to be at the place we were at 50 years ago, Catholic culture was at a very different place. \"But the fact that more women are becoming nuns than there has been in the past 25 years shows that as a generation we have turned a corner.\" The figures show that in the 1980s around 80 women were becoming nuns each year but the numbers gradually declined until 2004 when only seven women joined a convent. The small number of entrants has gradually increased again in the last 10 years, reaching 45 in 2014. Sister Cathy said nuns were now less visible in communities but they were now doing more hidden work with trafficked women or working as counsellors. And she added that some women may have been driven to the work after having seen more poverty in the UK during the economic downturn. \"It doesn't tend to be those who are coming from quite vulnerable places who become nuns, but there are people who want to be reaching out to those on the margins, who join,\" she said. Theodora Hawksley, 29, was until recently a postdoctoral researcher in theology at the University of Edinburgh, but at the beginning of the year she decided to end her career as an academic, and begin her training to become a nun. She joined the Congregation of Jesus in January and is now living in their house in Willesden, north London, while taking the first steps towards making vows of poverty, chastity and obedience. Ms Hawksley said: \"In one sense it is a bit like trying to explain to somebody why you are marrying the person you are. You can list their qualities, but in the end it is a relationship of love. \"I don't have to worry now about practical things like making a career for myself. I'm free to go where I'm needed and meet people at the margins. \"You are not on your own. It is an unusual life choice, but you are not the only one making it. There are plenty of people asking themselves the same questions.\" She admitted some of her friends were a \"bit bewildered\" when she revealed her plans, but most have been very supportive. Last year the majority of new nuns - 27 out of 45 - chose to be active religious sisters, who have a ministry outside of the convent, working in a community in areas such as nursing or teaching. Religious sisters are often sent to live in different communities every few years, both in the UK or abroad.

House masters, in charge of residential halls at the university, will become known as \"faculty deans\". Harvard Law School is also deciding whether to change its official seal, because of links to slavery. US campuses have faced a series of protests over allegations of racism. Harvard has not agreed that the use of \"master\" represented a link to slavery, but it has accepted campaigners' calls for a name change. It will mean changing the job titles of 24 members of staff - but will not affect other uses of \"master\", such as a master's level degree. Harvard academics say that the word \"master\" derives from the Latin term \"magister\" - a form of address for scholars or teachers. It is similar to terms such as \"school master\" or \"head master\". But protesters have argued that whatever its original derivation, the word now has connotations of slavery. Student campaigners are also calling for a change in the official seal of Harvard Law School, with a sit-in being held this week. The seal includes the coat of arms of 18th Century college donor Isaac Royall, who as well as establishing the college's first professorship in law, was a notoriously brutal slaveholder. Isaac Royall, whose money helped to endow the university, has been accused of burning slaves alive. A decision on whether to change the seal is expected to be made soon. Disputes about race and identity have affected many US campuses. Carol Christ, director of the Center for Studies in Higher Education, University of California, Berkeley, has said that \"symbolic fights are always about real and current political issues\" and race and diversity remain major campus issues. \"Race is so traumatic and central an issue in American culture,\" said Dr Christ. Last month, Amherst College, in Massachusetts, accepted student demands to drop links with its informal mascot, Jeffery Amherst, an 18th Century general accused of advocating infecting native Americans with smallpox. And there have been sit-ins at Princeton in a bid to rename a school named after Woodrow Wilson, because of claims the former US president held racist views. The protests by US students are part of a wider international campaign challenging historical titles, statues and emblems. But further demands for \"safe space\", where some students have called for the right to study away from attitudes or behaviour they find offensive, have been rejected by university leaders and others who have argued for the importance of protecting free speech. In South Africa, a statue of Cecil Rhodes was removed from the University of Cape Town, with protesters attacking the statue as an emblem of colonialism and apartheid. But a call to remove a statue of the 19th Century politician from Oriel College in Oxford University was rejected. Louise Richardson, the university's vice-chancellor, said students needed to be able to debate and confront \"ideas that make them uncomfortable\".",

The report found that although alcohol consumption has dropped since 2008, those in poorer communities are more likely to suffer or die from alcohol-related disease. The coalition government rejected a minimum price for alcohol in 2013. Health ministers said they would look at the evidence carefully. The public health review says that alcohol is now more affordable and people are drinking more than they did 40 years ago, making it the leading risk factor for ill health, early death and disability in those aged 15 to 49 in England. More adults are non-drinkers but there are still more than 10 million people in England drinking at levels that could damage their health. The report suggests there were 167,000 years of working life lost to alcohol in 2015 - mainly among the young and middle-aged. It concludes that reducing the affordability of alcohol is the most cost-effective way of reducing alcohol harm. But a plan to introduce a minimum price of 45p per unit of alcohol was shelved by the coalition government three years ago. In 2014, a ban on the sale of alcohol below cost price, defined as alcohol duty plus VAT, came into force in England and Wales. Public Health England (PHE) says implementing a minimum unit price (Mup) is the answer because it \"is a highly targeted measure which ensures tax increases are passed on to the consumer and improves the health of the heaviest drinkers\". It also adds that combing Mup with an increase in taxation would lead to \"substantial reductions in harm and increases in government revenue\". The report also says there is little evidence to suggest that putting more information on labels on alcoholic drinks would lead to a reduction in alcohol-related harm. A spokesman for the Department of Health said: \"While no one would want to interfere with the right of adults to enjoy a drink responsibly, this report shows clearly that the abuse of alcohol can cause significant health problems.\" And it added that new official guidance on alcohol limits, which say that men and women should drink no more than 14 units of alcohol a week, allowed people to make informed choices. Prof Kevin Fenton, national director of health and wellbeing at PHE, said alcohol damaged more than just individuals. \"Excessive alcohol consumption can harm children, wreck families, impact on workplace colleagues and can be a burden and drain on the NHS and economy. \"This evidence review will help local and national government and public services like the police and NHS to develop policies designed to reduce the harmful effects of alcohol.\" Shirley Cramer, chief executive of the Royal Society for Public Health, said she was hopeful that the evidence would be taken on board by government. \"The health harms of alcohol affect all sectors of society, but are felt most by the poorest and most vulnerable. \"All the evidence now points to Mup as one of the most effective potential ways to tackle these inequalities in harm.\" In Scotland, laws for the minimum pricing for alcohol were passed in 2012 but have not yet been introduced because of a series of legal challenges. The Welsh Government has said it wants to set a minimum 50p charge per unit of drink but UK ministers say alcohol law should be controlled by Westminster.",

The composer, whose hits include The Phantom of the Opera, Cats and Evita, is charging between \u00a325-\u00a395 for his latest London musical School of Rock. The average ticket price for a West End musical in 2016 was \u00a349.28 - up almost 6% on the previous year. \"Theatre is incredibly labour intensive,\" he said. \"On the whole, the prices of West End theatre are incredibly reasonable considering the cost of what it is to put something on.\" Last year, Lord Lloyd-Webber revealed that the physical running costs for one of his theatres was \u00a338,000 per week. On top of that, there are the costs of staging the production itself. The Financial Times estimated that the total weekly costs of a top musical are \u00a3150,000-\u00a3250,000. And most musicals spend years in development. The Stage estimated that the budget for the Broadway production of Groundhog Day - not a Lloyd Webber production - was $18m (\u00a314m). Elsewhere in the West End, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child has a top price of \u00a3140, while Hamilton has \u00a3200 premium tickets for when it officially moves to London in December. The topic of ticket costs often arouses strong feelings. Actor Andrew Scott recently called the high prices \"disgusting\", while last year, Mark Gatiss said theatre was an \"exclusive club for rich white people\". Lord Lloyd-Webber also pointed out that UK theatre tickets include 20% VAT - while tickets in the US are not taxed. The composer was speaking to BBC arts editor Will Gompertz's Heat Map programme on BBC 5 live, and also said he is currently looking for an idea for a new musical \"rather desperately\". \"I must say I don't think I've ever felt more excited about musicals,\" he said. \"I feel like I'm back when I'm started.\" That is partly down to a resurgence of the genre in the US with hit shows like Hamilton, Dear Evan Hansen and Come From Away. In comparison, the UK is coming up with few successful original musicals. \"Everything is so vibrant in America, which has always really been the home of musicals. Fourteen new musicals this year. I mean, fourteen. This year we've only had two in Britain.\" Lord Lloyd-Webber made his name in the 1970s collaborating with lyricist Tim Rice on shows like Jesus Christ Superstar, Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat and Evita. The pair haven't worked together on a full show since - but Lord Lloyd-Webber hasn't ruled out a reunion. \"It's a shame in a way we didn't go on writing together but we are very different people in several ways,\" he said. \"Never say never, but Tim has written the lyrics to the most successful musical currently playing in the world, which is The Lion King. He's got Beauty and the Beast, he's got Aladdin. \"He doesn't exactly need to write. If he wanted to do something, if he wanted to come to me with an idea... I think it would have to be him wanting to do the idea. \"If I went to him and said, 'Look, shall we do this?' I don't think he'd want to do that.\" Lord Lloyd-Webber was speaking ahead of receiving an outstanding contribution honour at the South Bank Sky Arts Awards on Sunday.

In their broad shade, there is another familiar sight: Lines of men, in plastic chairs, most of them jobless. They wait and talk, scouring the thin pickings of the local newspapers. Victor Lajar is one of them. He is 51 - his purple-striped shirt is perfectly pressed; his grey trousers have crisp vertical creases. Over a cup of clove-laced tea, he tells me he used to be a local government official. He was from the northern city of Malakal. He fled, during the civil war.  He has a family to support and no job. I ask my first guileless question: \"The war's over; why don't you return?\" Mr Lajar answers with his own question: \"You don't know about Malakal?\" he asks. \"It's ashes,\" he tells me. Few journalists go to Malakal. There are horrors aplenty elsewhere, and for long periods, the airport at the town has been inaccessible because of the fighting. I arrive, on a tiny United Nations charter, at Malakal airfield. We swiftly have company. A queue of large Russian-made transport planes, with no tail markings, land: Three in one hour, to re-supply the government forces, the SPLA, who currently hold the city. Before I head to Malakal itself, though, I visit the UN camp, just to the north-east. It is where 45,000 former residents of the city now live.

All I have to contend with is the broiling sun and the clouds of mosquitoes. When it is wet, the ground is awash with mud and human waste. The place carries the marks of the refugee camp. The new arrivals, strung out, hollow-eyed at its entrance. The tents and shacks for long-term residents crammed into a crazed puzzle; the attempts to winnow a bit of extra cash: Men selling heaps of rusty nails; children selling single cloves of garlic; women selling small piles of clothes. And there are the stories from their time in Malakal town: Of mothers and brothers shot, their bodies left to rot; of children lost in the chaos of fleeing. So many stories, so much trauma, that by the end of my first afternoon, I have to check my notebook to pick out Nyabed's misery from Teresa's from Mary's from Nyangit's. In the morning, I get a rare tour of the city, in a UN military patrol, with an SPLA escort. It is unlike any place I have ever visited. Malakal is - was - South Sudan's second city. In the decades of war with the north, it thrived. Now it is empty. Parts have been razed to the ground in the rage of warfare. But much has been wrecked simply by looting and vandalism, as rival forces allied to rival ethnic groups swept back and forth. Malakal has changed hands 12 times during this civil war. The children's hospital was built as a prize of independence. Now it is a shell, scorched, roofless, slowly strangled by the returning bush. But I could see no bullet holes, no splashes of shrapnel. It, like the Red Cross headquarters, had been wrecked and pillaged by fighters not battling for a front line, but drunk on ownership. Inside the Red Cross offices, amid the dust and destruction and fug of faeces, I find a discarded notebook. \"Rules for the Red Cross\", a neat hand has written.  Avoid \"real or perceived breaches of neutrality and impartiality for multiple reasons, including ethnicity\". I have seen places wrecked by war, but never a city vanish like this. Back at the UN camp, plans are quietly under way to be ready to deal with another 40,000 people who may yet cross over the White Nile to seek sanctuary and food. South Sudan's elusive peace: Five obstacles to peace in South Sudan And I ask my second guileless question.  It is addressed to one of the UN workers - he is a local, from Malakal. Is he going to watch the football that afternoon on TV? South Sudan is playing its first World Cup qualification match. \"How can I cheer for this country?\" he asks. \"We were so happy at independence.  I remember the moment.

        "article": "Economic policymakers must now decide whether and how they should respond to the UK's vote to leave the EU. A Leave vote was always seen as more likely to generate significant disturbances in the financial world. For that reason it is also the result which was thought more likely to pose a headache for the world's central banks. There have already been statements from some that they are prepared to act to maintain financial stability. There are two potential issues they might want to respond to in the short term: the stability of the (commercial) banks and swings in exchange rates. With the banks there is a possibility of a general rise in risk aversion, and some might have difficulty borrowing in the inter-bank market. The ultimate danger from that is that they might be unable to make debt payments as they come due. Central banks can address that by lending them extra money (liquidity). In the UK the Bank of England has already been doing this ahead of the referendum, hoping to ensure that there is sufficient liquidity already in place. The Bank has said it \"will continue to monitor market conditions carefully and keep its operations under review\". Other central banks will be ready to take similar action if they think it's needed. What if the strains show up in terms of foreign currency liquidity - say an Italian bank needing quick access to Swiss francs? There are arrangements known as swap lines put in place during the international financial crisis that can be used if necessary. The Italian bank could then get Swiss francs from the European Central Bank (ECB), (and the Swiss National Bank would be able to offer euros to Swiss banks if needed). The Bank of England is involved in these arrangements so it can get foreign currency if British banks were to need it urgently. With sharp moves in exchange rates, there are several options. They could just live with it. But if they felt the swings were too sharp and destabilising they could intervene using their foreign currency reserves. In the case of the UK, the decision to conduct such intervention is for the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, with the Bank of England carrying it out in the markets. So if there were too precipitous a fall in the value of one currency (sterling would be the obvious candidate in the event of a leave vote) the Bank of England could buy sterling with dollars or yen from its reserves, hoping the additional demand for the pound would support its value. Conversely the Swiss National Bank has been worried about too rapid a rise in the Swiss franc and has already been into the markets to buy other currencies such as the euro with its own national currency. Further action on these lines is a possibility. Currencies seen as havens are susceptible to unwanted sharp rises in times of financial stress and the Swiss franc is a prime example of that. Currency market intervention is often not announced. Some observers say there is evidence suggesting that the Swiss central bank might have intervened over the past week.  The intervention after the vote by the SNB was announced however. Interest rates can also be used to curb currency moves - a cut to stop a currency rising; a rate rise to prevent a fall. Both options, interest rate moves and intervention, can be co-ordinated by central banks. Further quantitative easing (QE) is also a possible response to a rising currency. It tends to drive down market interest rates and there has been some speculation that it might be on the agenda very soon,  perhaps from the Bank of Japan (which does not want to see the yen gaining value). Interest rate moves and QE can also be used to address longer term fallout - to tackle any impact on inflation or growth. The Bank of England has scope to cut rates further and it could undertake further QE. A fall in sterling would be inflationary, though up to a point that could be welcome as inflation is currently (at 0.3%) far below the Bank's target (2%). Another risk is that in a general flight from riskier assets the government debt problem in the eurozone could return, pushing up borrowing costs for countries such as Spain and Italy that were in the firing line a few years ago. Those earlier eurozone storms abated after the ECB announced that it was prepared in some circumstances to buy the bonds, the debts, of governments severely affected. In the event it never used this new weapon. The mere threat of doing so was enough to settle the eurozone bond market. Some observers, such as the London consultancy Capital Economics, think it could finally use this programme, if the aftermath of a leave vote were sufficiently disruptive. The likely timescale for these options varies.  In principle many could be done very quickly. The most urgent, if needed, would probably be bank liquidity. Interest rates and QE could be announced early, but could also be used as a response to economic fallout that might emerge over a longer period. The ECB's option of riding to the rescue of the likes of Spain or Italy would take some time. They would need to have an economic policy programme agreed with the rest of the eurozone. And Spain in particular, with an election this weekend, is itself in a period of political uncertainty that could make it difficult to conduct international negotiations.",

Youngsters are returning to school this week in Scotland, with parents in other areas of the UK preparing children for the next academic year. They are able to buy school shirts for ??1 and sweaters for ??2. But rising cotton and wool prices mean it is unlikely that uniform prices can fall any further, Neil Saunders, of Verdict Research, said. The big four UK supermarket chains - Asda, Tesco, Sainsbury's and Morrisons - as well as Marks and Spencer, are selling the constituent parts of a generic school uniform for less than ??5 each. For example, Asda is selling a white shirt for ??1, Sainsbury's has put a ??2 price tag on grey and black trousers, and Tesco has blue and green sweaters on sale for ??1.75. Although labour costs are low as many of these items are manufactured in Bangladesh and China, the margin for these items is still extremely slim. The supermarkets accept this owing to the brand loyalty they gain from customers, who buy uniforms at cheap prices and then stay in the store to buy other goods such as school accessories and groceries. The price war is unusual and prices for many other items are rising. Plus-size school uniforms launch The picture is also different for parents who must buy uniforms from specialist suppliers. Owing to prescriptive demands of these uniforms, prices tend to be higher than the generic supermarket clothes. Verdict Research estimates the UK school uniform market to be worth ??694m. The average price of a standard uniform has fallen by almost 21% since 2004, it said, with supermarkets increasing their market share. However, the total value of uniform and equipment sales has fallen from ??861m in 2004 to ??694m, the research group said. Neil Saunders, of Verdict, said that the quality of uniforms tended not to be at the same level as a decade ago. \"As long as they last, parents are not too concerned,\" he said. \"Children run around in these things, rip holes in them, and they fall apart anyway. As long as it lasts a term or half a year, parents are quite satisfied with that.\" He added that because wholesale prices of cotton and wool were rising, it would be difficult to cut prices any further. Last month, Marks and Spencer announced it had started to sell over-sized school uniforms for overweight children as young as four. Campaigners said it was simply commercial recognition of the fact obesity was a growing problem among younger pupils. Marks and Spencer said the trial range followed demand from parents.",

SABMiller said it had agreed \"in principle\" a \u00a344-a-share offer, after four previous attempts from AB InBev. AB InBev's brands include Budweiser, Stella Artois and Corona, while SABMiller produces Peroni and Grolsch. If the deal, worth about \u00a370bn, goes ahead, the newly-created firm will make about 30% of the world's beer. SABMiller has a workforce of close to 70,000 people in more than 80 countries, and global annual sales of more than $26bn. AB InBev has a workforce of 155,000 and global revenues of more than $47bn. What deal means for drinkers Anheuser-Busch InBev - 20.8% SABMiller - 9.7% Heineken - 9.1% Carlsberg - 6.1% China Resources Enterprise - 6% Source: Euromonitor, based on 2014 figures AB InBev had made four previous bid approaches for SABMiller - at \u00a338, \u00a340, \u00a342.15, and \u00a343.50 per share - but they had been rejected by SABMiller, which argued they undervalued the company. In a statement, the boards of the two firms said they had now \"reached agreement in principle on the key terms of a possible recommended offer\". The two companies have not yet formally finalised the terms of an offer, but the latest development means they have extended the City deadline for a firm offer until 28 October. Analysis: Matthew Davies, business reporter, Johannesburg SABMiller's African brands are actually one of the main reasons AB InBev is so thirsty for this merger. Carlos Brito, the chief executive of AB InBev, has said that Africa is a \"key piece\" of the deal. SABMiller, of course, has its roots in Africa - South African Breweries was founded around the time of gold rush in Johannesburg in the late 19th Century. As it stands, and if this deal goes through, it would mean that the merged entity would control 31% of global beer sales. AB InBev's brands are largely concentrated in the Americas and Europe; SABMIller has about 40 brands in Africa. It was the growth of SABMiller's African brands that really attracted AB InBev. What makes these brands so tasty is the growing African middle class, an army of consumers that all the major brewing companies have been eyeing up in recent years. As African beer drinkers have become more prosperous over the past 20 years, they have moved out of the informal home-brewing market and started to buy branded beer. The latest proposal comes a day before the original deadline, by which AB InBev had to make a formal bid for SABMiller or walk away for six months. The offer represents a premium of about 50% over and above SABMiller's share price in mid-September, before the bid battle started. In morning trade in London, SABMiller's share price rose 9% to \u00a339.48, while shares in AB InBev were 2.85% higher at \u20ac101.15 in trading in Brussels.",

However the single point was still enough to send opponents Kinlochshiel top of the table. The four pointer in Drumnadrochit to escape the relegation play off place gave Glenurquhart their first Premiership victory for two months, 2-0 at home to Lochaber. Mid table, a late surge gave Lovat a 3-1 success at Kingussie but without a change in league placing for either side. And in the National Division, Kilmallie's 5-1 victory at Ballachulish means that they trail leaders Glasgow Mid Argyll only on goals scored. There had been much pre-match build up as Kinlochshiel prepared for their first trip across the Skye Bridge for a long time on serious shinty business and it was the visiting side who opened the scoring through Duncan DA MacRae after just 12 minutes. And there it looked as if it would stay until the penultimate minute when Murchison secured a share of the points. However Skye, with four draws in five games, still seek their first victory. Although Shiel are now a point clear of previous leaders Kyles, whose Celtic Society Cup tie in Oban was postponed, they have also played three more games. Glenurquhart, their defence of the MacTavish Cup already at an end and sitting second bottom in the league, were desperate to kick start their season on the visit of Lochaber. After a goalless first half, David Smart opened the scoring early in the second and Conor Golabek put the points in the bag late on. This leaves Lochaber in the play off place on goal difference and with two extra games played. At The Dell, Kevin Bartlett put Lovat ahead midway through the first half and Thomas Borthwick got Kingussie's equaliser shortly after half time. Greg Matheson gave Lovat the lead again but it was only after Euan Ferguson's third in the final minute that they could breathe easily. After Lorne Brown scored first for Ballachulish, Kilmallie bit back with a hat trick from Duncan Rodger, which included a last minute penalty, bracketing a Liam MacDonald double. They have scored just three goals fewer than Glasgow Mid Argyll who were the day's top scorers in senior shinty when they ousted hosts Taynuilt 8-0 in the Camanachd Cup.

Violence has broken out between England fans, rival supporters and police for the last three days in the port city. There were also clashes in the stadium following England's 1-1 Euro 2016 draw with Russia, after Russia fans appeared to rush at England supporters. French police said one Briton had been seriously hurt in the earlier clashes. Witnesses said trouble began in the stadium after flares were let off by Russian fans near the end of the game. Some fans then climbed across barriers designed to keep rival fans apart. Russia's Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko said on Sunday: \"We will have a fine from Uefa, so I understand. We behaved incorrectly,\" R-Sport news agency reported. But he added there were \"many nuances\" to what happened, and Russian officials would investigate. Ned Ozkasim, from London, who was in the stadium, told the BBC: \"There was a large explosion, and after the Russian goal they started invading the area where some England fans were. \"I didn't see any retaliation from the England fans - they were just trying to get away. There were no riot police at the grounds as we expected. There were just stewards in hi-vis, and they just let it happen.\" Euro 2016: 'England fans are not idiots' From the moment England and Russia fans started flooding into Marseille on Thursday and Friday, there was an undercurrent of tension and violence that was transformed into scenes that were a throwback to some of football's worst hooligan excesses of the past. In the steamy, humid environment of this port city in the south of France, with alcohol flowing freely in searing temperatures and demonstrations of aggression from both sets of fans, all the ingredients were in place for events that unfolded in the Vieux-Port de Marseille. As a long, hot Saturday wore on towards a late kick-off at 21:00 local time, the scenery shifted to the magnificent, sweeping curves of the Stade Velodrome, culminating in the disgraceful incidents that took place just seconds after full-time. It was particularly disturbing given the high levels of security and policing that were in evidence around the stadium as the authorities remain on high alert after November's Paris attacks. Security, here at least, seemed in very short supply. It was the sort of hooliganism the game's rulers hoped had been stamped out but has reared its head in sinister fashion less than 48 hours into Euro 2016. It demands a strong reaction, not just from European football's governing body Uefa, but also those who saw the shortcomings of security exposed after the final whistle here. Read more BBC sports editor Dan Roan said England fans began jumping over the perimeter fence in panic. \"Big questions for Uefa here,\" he tweeted. \"Stampede appears to have been triggered by explosion. How did such a device make it inside and where was segregation?\" A senior FA security official said he had not witnessed anything like it in nine major tournaments he had attended. Kevin Miles, of the Football Supporters' Federation, said the incident came at the end of \"a very torrid day for many England fans\". Some fans had been attacked \"brutally and violently\" by Russian hooligans and locals youths, and it was \"clearly premeditated\", he claimed. Police had \"failed entirely\" to protect fans, he said. The British ambassador to France, Julian King, tweeted: \"Number of Brits in hospital overnight. Consular following closely with French authorities.\" He added that the embassy was \"reviewing the situation\" with the French authorities. Shadow home secretary Andy Burnham said the safety measures and security inside the stadium needed to be urgently looked at, and called for more stewarding. Earlier on Saturday French police said one Briton had to be resuscitated by officers and was left in a critical condition. Police in riot gear clashed with England fans, and used tear gas for a third day and a water cannon to try and stop outbursts of violence. There were also clashes in the city of Nice between police and fans from Northern Ireland and Poland, who are due to play their opening match later. Six people were reportedly injured, before order was restored. Before the game fans walked past ranks of police officers in riot gear on their way to the Stade Velodrome venue. The great majority of fans appeared to be peaceful, but there were some reports of trouble between English, Russian and local fans. BBC News correspondent Nick Eardley said he witnessed bloodied England fans being \"dragged away by police\", to the sound of sirens blaring out across the city's main square. Police told the BBC six people had been arrested and at least five injured during the scuffles. Some British journalists in the area pointed the finger at a gang of black-clad Russians, who they said had entered the port city's main square from a side street apparently seeking violence. The FA condemned the violence saying it was \"very disappointed by the terrible scenes of disorder\", while European football's governing body Uefa said it \"firmly condemns the incidents in Marseille\". England fans are now moving on from Marseilles as the team's next match is against Wales in Lens on Thursday afternoon. Russia play their next fixture against Slovakia the previous afternoon. Marseille's Stade Velodrome next hosts a match on Wednesday, when France play Albania.",

Officers raided a workshop in the port of Izmir, where they say they found life jackets stuffed with packaging rather than buoyancy aids. The four workers making the jackets included two young Syrian girls. On Tuesday, the bodies of 34 migrants were found along Turkey's coast. Many were wearing life jackets. Several children were among the dead. More than one million migrants crossed the Mediterranean in 2015 and the vast majority went from Turkey to Greece. Many migrants buy life jackets to help them survive the dinghy journey. A properly made jacket costs up to a \u00a3100 (\u20ac130; $150), reports the BBC's James Reynolds in Istanbul. But many migrants make do with cheaper, badly made ones, which cost just \u00a310 and may offer no protection whatsoever, our correspondent says. Izmir: Migrants' life jacket capital The life jacket 'mountains' of Lesbos Migration to Europe explained in graphics According to the UN, 3,771 people were listed as dead or missing in 2015. In Wednesday's raid the authorities seized 1,263 life jackets that failed to correspond to safety standards, Turkey's Dogan news agency said.  The workshop was in the centre of Izmir, a major hub for refugees and migrants. Four people were found working in the workshop, including two young Syrian girls, the news agency said. It did not publish the girls' ages. The confiscated life jackets have been sent to the local police for examination and an investigation has been launched. It comes one day after the bodies of more than 30 migrants were washed up in Turkey. Their boats capsized in bad weather on the way to the Greek island of Lesbos, the authorities say. Turkish media published harrowing images of the corpses, many still wearing life jackets that had apparently been of no use. Migrants are continuing to arrive on the Greek islands every day, despite the wintry weather. Lesbos is by far the most popular destination for migrants leaving Turkey. More than 500,000 reached the island in 2015. Late last year, Turkey reached a deal with the European Union to tighten its borders and reduce the numbers crossing to Greece in return for \u20ac3bn (\u00a32.1bn) and political concessions. A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.",

        "article": "Luke Wells has established himself in Sussex's County Championship side but is hungry for more. The 23-year-old batsman has set himself two goals; scoring 1,000 first-class runs for the first time in his career and breaking into the county's one-day team. Wells came close to his first target last season, when he scored 982 Championship runs at an average of 37.76, but he is eager to keep improving. \"I expect a lot from myself because I believe I am a good enough player to deliver bigger and better results,\" he told BBC Sport. \"Although I have done reasonably well over the last three years I don't feel I have done as well as I could have or should have done. Statistics correct at 31 May \"I feel my average isn't as high as it should be and that I should have hit 1,000 runs by now. \"You'd rather be expecting more than be satisfied with average results. Moving forward you always have to have the will to improve and exceed expectations. \"I don't put pressure on myself. I just see it as a challenge.\" The left-hander believes he should have reached the 1,000-run milestone in 2013. \"If I didn't give away a couple of innings I would have got there,\" he said. \"I spent my winter in Sydney and definitely improved. I feel I've opened up a few areas through the offside I may not have had previously and am targeting about 1,100 or 1,200 runs. \"The only difference is when you are in and on 40, that you give it away. If you convert those into slightly higher scores, when then there is no reason why you should get out, then I will be at 1,200 runs. \"I feel I am a better player now and I have the mental concentration and the defensive technique to do it.\" Ahead of the current match against Nottinghamshire at Hove, Wells had scored 221 runs in his five Championship appearances this season - with his high score of 79 not out coming against Somerset in April. He admits he is \"a fair way\" off his target but is keen to contribute to Sussex's title challenge, with the Hove side currently fifth in the Division One table. I am targeting about 1,100 or 1,200 runs. I feel I am a better player now and I have the mental concentration and the defensive technique to do it \"I feel in really good nick at the moment and that there's a big three-figure score just around the corner,\" he said. \"I know if I keep doing the same things and backing myself I'll score a good amount of runs. \"It may sound cliched but if I get a thousand runs and we win the title then brilliant. If I get 900 and we win the title I'll take that. As long as the runs I'm scoring are contributing to winning efforts that is most important. \"We have got a strong squad and one hallmark of this season so far is competition for batting spaces. Everyone is under pressure as you know you need to get your runs. \"That is the way it should be in any squad. You shouldn't be able to rest on your laurels as people around you want to take your spot.\" The former England Under-19 international, who is the son of former Sussex captain and one-time England Test player Alan, believes his time in Australia has improved his all-round game. \"I had a clear basic goal which was to work on a couple of technical areas to do with my trigger and my stance to be in a better position so that I can move more freely and make me more dynamic at the crease,\" he said. \"I feel I am a lot quicker on my feet, which will help in all formats of my game. I've worked on shots through the off-side, my one-day skills in general and my fitness.\" Wells, meanwhile, describes his efforts to break into Sussex's one-day side as \"difficult and frustrating\". The Eastbourne-born player has only made one competitive Twenty20 appearance for the club, coming against Glamorgan in 2011, and has made just a handful of appearances in List A competition. Sussex have performed strongly in both Twenty20 and 40-over competition in recent years, but made group-stage exits in both formats in 2013. Wells says the county calendar has not helped his cause but hopes the new schedule, which sees the T20 Blast played throughout the season and the new 50-over One Day Cup played in July and August, could benefit him. \"So far in my career I've started well in four-day competition then T20 comes along, I have a big break in the middle of my season and I try to find a way to keep the momentum going,\" he said. \"It has been quite hard work. I think this year with the Friday nights will help. \"I've been pushing as hard as I can and have been working a lot on my one-day skills. I can strike a ball as far as anyone in the squad. \"It is just about putting it all together into performances in the middle. \"It is hard with the schedule in and around four-day cricket to find time to play second XI T20 games. \"You need your currency, as it were, to show the coaches that you can do it.\" Wells did play five CB40 matches for Sussex last season but only managed to make seven runs in four innings. \"Unfortunately last year I did get a run at the top of the order but I got out,\" he said. \"They were classic dismissals - a caught behind and a couple of lbws - but that's the way it goes. That is suddenly four games and you haven't scored a run. \"I feel I am in a good place with my game and am offering other skills, not just with my batting. I am determined to get in the side. \"Every year we always push quite hard in one-day competitions and have had quite a lot of success. Last year we didn't have that and I was disappointed to not get a go in a T20 game come the end of the campaign. \"Having said that the team needed its momentum and wanted to go with the same guys, which is absolutely understandable. \"All I can do is put myself in the best possible position that when I do get a chance, to take it.\"",

Roger Caffrey, 70, was found guilty of three counts of rape and 12 counts of indecent assault in Nottinghamshire from 1978 to 1994. One ex-pupil was raped six times by Caffrey at his home during a \"campaign of rape\", Nottingham Crown Court heard. A number of offences against his seven victims took place during lesson time. Caffrey was cleared of two charges of indecent assault following a three-week trial. Police began investigating him after a victim, who said she was raped when she was nine years old, contacted officers in December 2012. Nottinghamshire Police said all but one of the offences took place when Caffrey was deputy head teacher at Northgate Primary School in Nottingham - now the Djanogly Northgate Academy - from 1978 to 1984. Caffrey, of Sandesquoy, Tankerness, Orkney, taught at 10 schools in the county in a career spanning more than three decades. Pupils \"no older than 11 years of age\" were touched while they read aloud in class, or when they were in a store cupboard in the classroom, the court heard. Two victims were raped at Caffrey's home. One of the rape victims went to the police 22 years ago but no charges were brought due to a lack of evidence, the court heard. She was contacted in 2013 following the start of the investigation into Caffrey, but the original documents into the 1994 case had been lost. Michael Evans, defending Caffrey, said: \"He was a teacher for a number of years and, outside of these offences, a very good teacher.\" Judge Timothy Spencer QC said: \"You deliberately targeted these girls, you calculated that they were ripe for this sort of abuse and you calculated that they would not tell. \"Their classroom, their school, should have been a place where they felt safe and secure. They must have felt anything but.\" Det Con Rob Smith, of Nottinghamshire Police, added: \"Caffrey believed that he would be able to put his past behind him, but...it has been shown that the passage of time is no hindrance to justice taking its course.\"",

        "article": "The Daily Show, whose host Jon Stewart is stepping down after 16 years at the helm, is a comedy programme, yet regular viewers know that laughs are just one part of it. For many Americans, The Daily Show has become an alternative way of learning about the world. And Stewart - jabbing his pen, wrong-footing interviewees, delivering impassioned monologues, and yes, cracking a gag or two - has been its biggest draw. Here are some of his highlights. At the turn of the century when Jon Stewart, newly-installed host, dubbed his show's US presidential election coverage \"Indecision 2000\" few knew how apt the name would become. George W Bush's campaign against then-Vice President Al Gore would last far beyond election day as workers in Florida struggled through recounts and the Supreme Court eventually got involved. Surrounded by talent like Lewis Black, Steve Carell and Stephen Colbert, Stewart lampooned politicians as well as reporters for taking themselves too seriously. \"After 19 days, and endless court battles, the Florida vote has been certified, giving the state - and presidency - to George W Bush, by a total of 537 votes,\" he said in one skit. \"Wow. That's a landslide. If you are running for student council treasurer.\" In his first broadcast after the 9/11 attacks, Stewart delivered a tearful, highly personal attempt to make sense of the worst terror attacks in US history. He opened with an apology for \"another entertainment show beginning with an overwrought speech of a shaken host and television is nothing if not redundant\". \"They said to get back to work. And there were no jobs available for a man in the foetal position under his desk crying,\" he said, drawing one of the few laughs. He concluded by saying: \"The view from my apartment was the World Trade Centre. Now it's gone.\" \"But you know what the view is now? The Statue of Liberty. The view from the south of Manhattan is the Statue of Liberty. You can't beat that.\" In 2006, Stewart was given a gift in the form of a bizarre incident where then US Vice President Dick Cheney accidentally shot and injured a companion, Harry Whittington, while on a quail hunt. Stewart noted that Whittington was the first person to be shot by a US vice president since Alexander Hamilton was shot by Aaron Burr in 1804. \"Hamilton [was] of course shot in a duel with Aaron Burr over issues of honour, integrity and political manoeuvring. Whittington? Mistaken for a bird.\" The financial crisis was at its peak in 2009. Markets slumped, with commentators comparing the crash to the Great Depression of the 1930s. For several episodes, Stewart criticised business network CNBC for failing to predict the collapse of major US financial institutions or question their soundness, culminating in an angry exchange with one of the network's bullish hosts, Jim Cramer. \"You knew what the banks were doing, and yet you were touting it for months and months. The entire network was,\" Stewart said. \"And so now to pretend that this was some sort of crazy, once-in-a-lifetime tsunami that no-one could have seen coming, is disingenuous at best and criminal at worst.\" Barack Obama has made several appearances on the show, for the first time as a youthful, grinning state senator for Illinois in 2005. \"The only person more over-hyped than me is you,\" Obama quipped. And in a sign of the show's, and its guest's, rise to prominence, he appeared again in 2010 as the first US president to be a guest of The Daily Show. Stewart needled the president over how the optimism of his campaign had become mired in the reality of day-to-day politics, asking if his campaign slogan should have been \"yes we can, given certain conditions\". Welcoming her into the studio to broad applause, Stewart said it was an honour to meet teenage activist Malala Yousafzai, who was shot by a member of the Taliban in Pakistan. She told Stewart that if she were to meet the man who shot her, she would tell him how important education is, and that she wants education for his children as well. Stewart was touched: \"I know your father is back stage, and he is very proud of you, but would he be mad if I adopted you? Because you sure are swell.\" Years on from 9/11, Stewart again had to respond to a horrific act of violence, in this case one that attacked the freedom of satirists themselves. \"[It is a] stark reminder that for the most part, the legislators and journalists and institutions we jab and ridicule are not in any way the enemy,\" he said. \"For however frustrating or outraged the back-forth becomes, it's still a back-and-forth conversation among those on, let's call it 'Team Civilization'.\"",

With a television audience of 110 million, it's one of the biggest platforms in the world - and Gaga has been putting in the hours to ensure her set is suitably spectacular. \"We were [rehearsing] in the tent for about a week and a half, then we had to move to bigger studios in Hollywood where we are working on the rest of the show,\" she told Houston radio station Mix 96.5. \"And then we will send that equipment to Houston where we will finish rehearsals. Fans can expect a performance that spans my career so far.\" She has a high standard to live up to - notably Prince's show in 2007, which took place in the middle of a Miami thunderstorm and is widely accepted as the greatest performance in the event's history, if not Prince's career. Here are some of the other most memorable - and surprising - moments from the last 30 years. Super Bowl performers get a very strict 12-minute time limit, so most performers cram their set with as much music as possible. Not Michael Jackson. After shooting onto the stage at the Pasadena Rose Bowl, he stood completely still, staring at the world for a full 90 seconds. Ninety. It was a master class in ratcheting expectation to a fever pitch. And the screams when he launched into Jam (not one of his best songs) proved he knew what he was doing. Brilliantly, Jackson staged this entire performance while wearing a jacket it looked like he'd borrowed from Muammar Gaddafi. Beat that, Gaga. Baby, he was born to run... and slide on his knees... and crotch slam a TV camera. In his autobiography, The Boss explains the incident like this: \"Too much adrenalin, a late drop, too much speed, here I come, Mike\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 BOOM! \"And I'm onto his camera, the lens implanted into my chest with one leg off the stage. I use his camera to push myself back up and\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 BLAM! BORN TO RUN!\" It led to the memorable headline: \"America Attacked by Bruce Springsteen's crotch\" - but it didn't stop the star delivering one of the most powerful and energetic Super Bowl shows in recent history. Even if they were fined for over-running by 40 seconds. Coldplay were the headline act at last year's Super Bowl in Santa Clara - but someone forgot to tell Beyonce. She only performed one song, Formation, underscoring its message of black pride and power with back-up dancers dressed in leather body suits and black berets reminiscent of the Black Panthers movement. Some of her dancers were even pictured holding up a sign declaring \"Justice 4 Mario Woods\" - a 26-year-old black man who was shot dead by armed police in San Francisco two months earlier. The performance heralded the arrival of her unapologetically political album, Lemonade, later in the year. You can't out-diva Diana, something she was determined to prove when she strode onto the pitch in Tempe, Arizona, for Super Bowl XXX. She raced through 10 songs and four costume changes in 12 minutes, then jumped into a helicopter and fled the stadium. Which is one way to beat the post-game traffic. For the first few decades, the Super Bowl half-time performance featured marching bands, drill teams and Disney's mouseketeers. 1987's show was altogether more bizarre. A magician named \"Elvis Presto\" burst out of a jukebox, before performing a series of conjuring tricks, aided by 2,000 part-time dancers, 102 custom Harley Davidson motorcycles and some of rock's biggest classics. At the culmination of the show, the \"Prince of Prestidigitation\" performed an interactive magic trick (\"pick a card, concentrate real hard\") while viewers at home watched through 3D glasses. It was cheesier than a wheel of brie - and prompted the NFL to adopt a more modern approach. She arrived on a mechanical tiger, and departed on a shooting star - but Katy Perry couldn't compete with the infamous \"left shark\". He was one of two foam-suited dancers flanking Katy while she performed Teenage Dream. While the one on the right was forgettable, the left shark flailed around in a desperate attempt to remember his dance moves. It quickly became a viral sensation, spawning a whole range of merchandise from the ever-savvy pop star. And when the half-time show was nominated for an Emmy, Katy made sure to thank her faithful friend. Poor old Janet Jackson. She was at the end of a triumphant, hit-laden medley when Justin Timberlake ripped the front off her bodice, revealing a heavily-bejewelled superboob. Few ever believed that the \"wardrobe malfunction\" was indeed a malfunction - but if you look at the photographs taken immediately after the event, Jackson appears mortified (notably, these were not the pictures printed by the press). Nonetheless, America went apoplectic. The Federal Complaints Commission reportedly got more than 200,000 complaints, while Janet was blacklisted by MTV and radio. Her career never fully recovered. But there is a bright side to this story. A PayPal employee called Jawed Karim missed the half-time show and grew frustrated that he couldn't watch the incident online. In response, he and his friends Steve Chen and Chad Hurley began coding a website where people could upload their own content. That site would end up being YouTube.

        "article": "The authorities in China have removed from websites a popular documentary which highlights the country's severe pollution problem. Under the Dome explains the social and health costs of pollution, and was watched by more than 100 million people online, sparking debates. It was removed just two days after Premier Li Keqiang called pollution a blight on people's lives. Mr Li had promised to fight it with all the government's might. The environmental issue has dominated the current session of the Chinese parliament, the National People's Congress, in Beijing. The newly appointed environmental protection minister, Chen Jining, had praised Under The Dome, telling reporters it should \"encourage efforts by individuals to improve air quality\". But having initially praised the documentary, China's communist leaders now seem to have banned it, the BBC's Michael Bristow reports. It appears to tell an inconvenient truth, something the leaders do not want to hear during the current annual meeting of parliament, he adds. Standing in front of an audience in a simple white shirt and jeans, Ms Chai speaks plainly throughout the 103-minute video, which features a year-long investigation of China's noxious pollution problem. At times, the documentary is deeply personal. Near the start of the documentary, Ms Chai interviews a six-year-old living in the coal-mining province of Shanxi, one of the most polluted places on earth. \"Have you ever seen stars?\" Ms Chai asks. \"No,\" replies the girl. \"Have you ever seen a blue sky?\" \"I have seen a sky that's a little bit blue,\" the girl tells her. \"But have you ever seen white clouds?\" \"No,\" the girl sighs. The film watched more than 100 million times Under the Dome, a year-long investigation of pollution in China, had garnered more than 100 million views in less than 48 hours. Made by renowned investigative journalist Chai Jing and funded with her own money, the film sharply criticises the Chinese state's lax environmental laws. As of Saturday, the film was no longer available on popular Chinese mainland video sites. A link on the Youku website that previously led to the video now prompts the message, \"We're very sorry, Youku was unable to find the page you requested\". Neither Youku or Ms Chai responded immediately when asked to comment, the Reuters news agency reports. China operates the world's most formidable online censorship machine, known as the Great Firewall. Some social media users in China voiced frustration at the removal of the film. \"When will this country be able to face the attitudes of its own people?\" wrote one Weibo user, quoted by AFP news agency. Another Weibo user quoted by Reuters wrote: \"Some people have the power to completely smother Chai Jing's Under the Dome on the internet but don't have the power to smother haze in this country.\" Alvin Lin, the Beijing-based China climate and energy policy director of the US-based environmental group the Natural Resources Defense Council, said: \"They've made a big deal about air pollution in the last couple of [legislative meetings]. Under the Dome made it so they really really have to talk about it.\" Willy Lam, a political analyst at the Chinese University in Hong Kong, said: \"They are really serious about this except the problem is really entrenched. \"It is intertwined with all aspects of industry and agriculture and so forth, and it's a really difficult problem to tackle.\" The film is still available on YouTube with English subtitles.",

        "article": "Vote Leave has promised a \u00a350m prize for the person who correctly predicts who they think will win each game of the 2016 European Football Championships this summer. The claim: Anyone can win \u00a350 million by correctly predicting the result of all 51 games in the Euro 2016 football championships. Vote Leave says this figure represents the amount of money the UK sends to the EU every day. Reality Check verdict: Unlikely anyone could win this prize. The odds of winning are only slightly better than the odds of guessing the mobile phone numbers of the next two strangers you see in the street. The UK does not send \u00a350 million a day to the EU. But, as the Reality Check team have been finding out, the chances of winning are staggeringly small. There are a total of 36 games in the group stage of the tournament and 15 knockout matches. The odds of correctly forecasting all 51 games randomly are a sextillion to one. Now, your in-depth knowledge of European football may tip the odds more in your favour, but remember you also have to guess which teams will qualify from the group stages. The finals feature 24 teams for the first time and with 16 of them qualifying for the first knockout round, the results are harder to predict. Even if you had a 70% chance of getting each one right, the odds are probably about one in 80,000,000 - quite a bit worse than your chances of winning the lottery (45,000,000 to one since you ask). Vote Leave recognise that the odds are slim but campaign director Dominic Cummings defended the contest, saying: \"We want everyone to have the chance to win the sort of money most people can only dream of, unless they are a banker or a Euro MP.\" For the record, MEPs earn 8,213 euros (about \u00a36,250) per month. To qualify for the prize, participants have to enter their phone number, together with their email and home addresses, with a Vote Leave source admitting it would allow them to gather the contact details of thousands of potential voters. Will Straw, executive director of Britain Stronger In Europe, described the competition as a \"con\". But Vote Leave's privacy policy allows anyone to \"opt out\" from receiving campaign information \"at any time\". Odds aside, Vote Leave have based their competition prize figure on the assertion that the UK sends \u00a350m a day - or \u00a3350m a week to the EU. They've been sharply reprimanded for this by Sir Andrew Dilnot, the chairman of the UK Statistics Authority for using it. He described it as \"misleading\" and said it \"undermines trust in official statistics\". We've looked into this claim before and concluded that once you allow for the rebate and money that comes back to the UK for things like farming subsidies, the UK sends roughly \u00a323 million a day to the EU. This would be a very tidy lump sum but not nearly as generous as the amount that Vote Leave is offering. Read more: The facts behind claims in the EU debate",

        "article": "An Asian police officer who raised concerns about a \"racist\" toy monkey at work was accused of gross misconduct, BBC News has learned. The officer said he found the black animal toy wearing an officer's shirt at a police station in central London. Scotland Yard promised to look into the matter but the detective was himself investigated for making the story up. He was later cleared at a misconduct hearing and received damages from the force after taking legal action. The details emerged after a separate case at Thames Valley Police in which an officer put a monkey on a black colleague's desk. A misconduct panel concluded last month that Det Sgt Andrew Mottau was not being racist but should have realised the toy animal could be offensive. The incident involving the Metropolitan Police began in September 2013 when the Indian-born detective constable claimed to have seen a large monkey toy in the office of the Case Progression Unit at Belgravia police station. He said the stuffed black toy had a police officer's shirt on and a label saying \"night-duty ERO\" - Evidential Review Officer. One of the EROs at the time was a black police officer. The detective was concerned the use of the toy was racist and had not been investigated properly. He raised the matter during a live internal website chat known as the \"Commissioner's Forum\", where staff are encouraged to discuss problems with the Met Commissioner, who at the time was Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe. The detective received an online reply saying: \"What is described - if accurate - is unacceptable\" and was told that it would be looked into \"immediately\". But a month later, the detective himself was put under investigation for allegedly posting \"untrue and potentially inflammatory comments\". He was told his actions had \"breached the standards of professional behaviour... relating to \"honesty and integrity\" and \"discreditable conduct\", claims which, if proved, could have led to his dismissal Eventually, in June 2015, after protracted internal disciplinary proceedings, the officer attended a gross misconduct hearing where it was ruled there was \"no case to answer\" and he was cleared. Paul Turpin, who was a representative for the Metropolitan Police Federation and supported the officer through the process, said: \"I was surprised when the matter was referred to a gross misconduct hearing and was not surprised when that hearing found the officer had no case to answer.\" He suggested the allegation should never have got that far: \"Matters should be dealt with at the lowest appropriate level at the earliest possible opportunity.\" Scotland Yard said there had been an \"internal review\" of the handling of the case after the hearing. It said the original allegation about the monkey had been \"investigated locally and progressed as far as it could be\", though the inquiry was unable to establish who had placed the black toy animal in the police station. The Asian detective, who has not been named by the BBC at his own request, began legal proceedings against the Met at an employment tribunal alleging he had been racially discriminated against and victimised. But before a full hearing took place the force reached a settlement and agreed to pay damages. The details of the agreement are confidential but the amount of compensation is thought to be in the region of \u00c2\u00a335,000. The officer declined to comment and has not divulged any details of the agreement to the BBC. The Met confirmed a settlement had been reached \"following judicial mediation\" at the Tribunal Services in March 2016. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Richard Martin, who is in charge of professionalism at Scotland Yard, said the force had made \"significant investment\" in improving the way it handled staff complaints linked to discrimination, bullying or harassment and had introduced a new \"whistle-blowing\" policy. \"We have long recognised that people... fear being victimised if they raise a complaint, regardless of whether that fear is justified,\" he said. \"That has never been acceptable and we continue to make it very clear to our staff that victimisation will never be tolerated, that it will be investigated, and will have serious repercussions if it occurs\". But Janet Hills, chairwoman of the Metropolitan Black Police Association, said the use of a black monkey toy and the treatment of the Asian police detective indicated there was still a long way to go. \"We're still trying to get rid of the dinosaurs in policing who are still protecting that culture\", she said, describing the \"monkey\" incident as \"unbelievable\" and \"unacceptable\". \"It's not just a toy, it's a toy to be used to say 'this is what I think of you',\" she said. \"It's racist and discriminatory behaviour,\" she said, adding that it went on because people thought they could \"get away with it\".

        "article": "Rail ticket machines cause so much confusion that one-fifth of passengers who use them buy the wrong ticket, according to the rail regulator. While 7% of people underpay and could be fined, 13% are paying too much. The Office of Rail and Road (ORR) wants train companies to refund passengers who accidentally buy tickets that are too expensive for their journey. Train operators said that vending machines were designed for simple ticket requirements. They say plans to simplify fares will help them to give clearer information on ticket machines. The ORR employed mystery shoppers to buy rail tickets from machines. \"Despite investment in new technology and the removal of jargon from ticket machines, our new research shows passengers may be paying more for their journey than necessary,\" said John Larkinson, ORR director of railway markets and economics. \"We are calling on train companies to commit to refund anyone who finds that they could have bought a cheaper ticket for the same journey,\" he added. Rail operators C2C and Scotrail already have a price guarantee in place for when passengers overpay. Earlier this month, the Rail Delivery Group (RDG), which represents train operators, announced a trial scheme to simplify fares. It said the 16 million fares on offer were \"baffling\" for passengers. As part of the trial, which begins in May, ticket machines on stations will also be updated, to make sure they show the cheapest fares available. \"To quickly benefit passengers, the Rail Delivery Group must set out what improvements to ticket machines will be made in the short term,\" said Mr Larkinson. Paul Plummer, chief executive of the RDG, told the BBC that operators were aware that there was a problem with machines, and that they had formulated a 10-point plan to improve them. Yet he pointed out the machines were designed as \"queue-busters\" for passengers with relatively simple requirements, but \"expectations [of passengers] had evolved\". He said that the system of fares was far too complicated. The RDG also added: \"Complex, decades-old government rail fare regulations make it more difficult for train companies to offer the right, simple options on ticket machines. \"Simplifying the number and types of fares in the system will let train companies provide customers with clear information and help them to make better informed choices,\" they added. by Ben Morris, business reporter In the British Rail era, rail fares were a relatively simple affair, with ticket prices worked out on a cost-per mile basis. But in the 1990s, in an effort to make the network more efficient, the operation of rail services was handed to private train operating companies (Tocs). The Tocs were given some freedom to set ticket prices, with advanced ticket bookings particularly important to them, as it helps them to keep their trains full. To protect passengers, other fares were regulated, including season tickets and off-peak fares. The result is a patchwork of fares, that becomes even more complicated when a passenger wants to cross several train regions. Savvy travellers have been taking advantage of this by splitting their journey into several tickets, rather than one through-ticket.",

The move apparently follows a request from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office. It also comes ahead of a speech on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by US Secretary of State John Kerry. On Friday, the US chose not to veto a UN Security Council resolution calling for an end to settlement construction. The decision to abstain infuriated Mr Netanyahu, whose spokesman said on Tuesday he had \"ironclad information\" from Arab sources that the White House had helped draft the language of the resolution and \"pushed hard\" for its passage. A US state department spokesman said the accusation was \"just not true\", but he hoped the resolution would \"serve as a wake-up call\" for Israel. More than 500,000 Jews live in about 140 settlements built since Israel's 1967 occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. The Security Council resolution passed on Friday stated that the establishment of settlements \"has no legal validity and constitutes a flagrant violation under international law and a major obstacle to the achievement of the two-state solution and a just, lasting and comprehensive peace\". Israel rejected the resolution, and the BBC's Yolande Knell said it was particularly angry about the condemnation of building in East Jerusalem - which it sees as part of its capital, but which the Palestinians want as the capital of their future state. Mr Netanyahu responded over the weekend by summoning the ambassadors of the US and the 14 countries on the Security Council who voted in favour of the resolution, recalling Israel's ambassadors to New Zealand and Senegal, cutting aid to Senegal, and cancelling a visit by Ukraine's prime minister. The Jerusalem Planning and Housing Committee had indicated it would press ahead with a planned vote on authorising 492 new homes in the settlements of Ramat Shlomo and Ramot. But on Wednesday, planning committee member Hanan Rubin said the vote had been postponed. Mr Rubin told the BBC this was at the request of the prime minister's office, to avoid further straining relations with Washington hours before Mr Kerry's speech. \"It's in our interest to avoid political voting in Jerusalem because Jerusalem is not the same as settlements around Israel,\" he said. \"We are creating affordable housing and housing for young families... and if there is a big storm and Kerry's speech today, we are looking to avoid this conflict.\" Mr Kerry is expected to lay out his vision later on Wednesday for ending the Israel-Palestinian conflict, and address what a senior state department official described as \"misleading critiques\" of the Obama administration by the Israeli government. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has said the resolution \"paves the way\" for the upcoming conference on Middle East peace in France on 15 January. \"We hope this conference comes up with a mechanism and timetable to end the occupation,\" he told a meeting of his Fatah party on Monday.",

The adware - dubbed Superfish - was potentially compromising their security, said experts. The hidden software was also injecting adverts on to browsers using techniques more akin to malware, they added. Lenovo faces questions about why and for how long it was pre-installed on machines - and what data was collected. The company told the BBC in a statement: \"Lenovo removed Superfish from the preloads of new consumer systems in January 2015.  At the same time Superfish disabled existing Lenovo machines in the market from activating Superfish. \"Superfish was preloaded on to a select number of consumer models only.  Lenovo is thoroughly investigating all and any new concerns raised regarding Superfish.\" Users began complaining about Superfish in Lenovo's forums in the autumn, and the firm told the BBC that it was shipped \"in a short window from October to December to help customers potentially discover interesting products while shopping\". User feedback, it acknowledged, \"was not positive\". Last month, forum administrator Mark Hopkins told users that \"due to some issues (browser pop up behaviour, for example)\", the company had \"temporarily removed Superfish from our consumer systems until such time as Superfish is able to provide a software build that addresses these issues\". He added it had requested that Superfish issue an auto-update for \"units already in market\". Superfish was designed to help users find products by visually analysing images on the web to find the cheapest ones. Such adware is widely regarded in the industry as a form of malware because of the way it interacts with a person's laptop or PC. Security expert from Surrey University Prof Alan Woodward said: \"It is annoying. It is not acceptable. It pops up adverts that you never asked for. It is like Google on steroids. \"This bit of software is particularly naughty. People have shown that it can basically intercept everything and it could be really misused.\" According to security experts, it appears that Lenovo had given Superfish permission to issue its own certificates, allowing it to collect data over secure web connections, known in malware parlance as a man-in-the-middle attack. \"If someone went to, say, the Bank of America then Superfish would issue its own certificate pretending to be the Bank of America and intercept whatever you are sending back and forth,\" said Prof Woodward. Ken Westin, senior analyst at security company Tripwire, agreed: \"If the findings are true and Lenovo is installing their own self-signed certificates, they have not only betrayed their customers' trust, but also put them at increased risk.\" Although Lenovo has said that it has removed Superfish from new machines and disabled it from others, it was unclear what the situation would be for machines where it had already been activated. Prof Woodward said: \"Lenovo is being very coy about this but it needs to explain how long it has been doing this, what the scale is and where all the data it has collected is being stored. \"There will be remnants of it left on machines and Lenovo does not ship the disks that allow people to do a clean install.\" It raises wider questions about the deals that computer manufacturers do with third parties and the amount of software that comes pre-installed on machines. Mr Westin said: \"With increasingly security and privacy-conscious buyers, laptop and mobile phone manufacturers may well be doing themselves a disservice by seeking outdated advertising based monetisation strategies.\" Users were particularly angry that they had not been told about the adware. One Lenovo forum user said: \"It's not like they stuck it on the flier saying... we install adware on our computers so we can profit from our customers by using hidden software. \"However, I now know this. I now will not buy any Lenovo laptop again.\" The problem also caused a storm on Twitter, where both Lenovo and Superfish were among the most popular discussion topics.",

None of the top seven on the leaderboard have ever won one of golf's four majors. Lowry birdied the fourth, sixth and seventh to briefly move a shot clear at the top on his own.

He scrambled a par on the second after sending his tee shot, via a spectator's head, into a food stall. However, the American double-bogeyed the third as his challenge faltered. Westwood, 43, is looking to win his first major at his 73rd attempt.

The State of Food & Agriculture 2016 report said \"business as usual\" would leave millions at risk from hunger. Last year, nations adopted a UN goal of ending hunger by 2030. \"The climate is changing, so agriculture must change too,\" explained Rob Voss, director of FAO's Agricultural Development Economics division. \"We are saying that because agriculture is already very affected by the impacts of climate change, particularly the countries in the tropical zones. \"Also, agriculture is contributing itself to about one fifth of the global emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases,\" Mr Voss, who headed the team that produced the FAO State of Food & Agriculture 2016 report, added. \"If we continue along the present pathways then we will not be able to [deliver] food security around the world and we will not be able to stabilise the climate.\" As a result, he told BBC News, there was a need for \"major changes\" to take place in the sector. \"One of the challenges is agriculture itself. As soon as we shovel the ground then we are already releasing greenhouse gas emissions. Also, as it is so dependent on water and quality of land, any impact from the change in climate has a direct impact.\" Therefore, he said, the challenge was bearing these changes in mind and looking at ways to shift to a more sustainable footing. \"A lot of the technologies that are available that allow us to do things differently do face a number of hurdles, especially when it comes to smallholder farmers in developing countries.' These include the cost of changing the way farmers produce their food; knowledge of shifting to the novel ways of farming; urbanisation; access to water. In terms of making the change to deliver a robust global food system, Mr Voss said the report highlighted four steps that could be taken: \"First, put in the steps that would help farmers switch to more sustainable practices, such as more efficient use of fertilizers and using heat tolerant and drought resistant crop varieties.\" He added that management systems, such as agroforestry - which places forestry cultivation around farmlands, would also be beneficial as it helps farmers build in great resilience against the impacts of climate change. \"Secondly, we need to work harder to increase the capacity of soils and forestry to sequestrate carbon. Deforestation and changes to land-use is one of the major sources of emissions from the sector. \"A third area where we can immediately start work on is to reduce food losses and waste. We estimate that about one third of the food we produce gets lost in the post-harvest process or gets wasted at the consumer end. \"The fourth area, which is more challenging, is to try and do something about people's diets. What we have been seeing around the world is a clear shift towards increasing demands for food products that put a lot more pressure on natural resources.\" The report observed: \"Rebalancing diets towards less animal-sourced foods would make an important contribution in this direction, with probable co-benefits for human health.\" FAO director-general Jose Graziano da Silva said that the coming twelve months should be about \"putting commitments into action\", referring to the adoption of the UN Sustainable Development Goal of delivering \"zero hunger\" by 2030. He also observed that agriculture was set to be one of the main topics for discussion at the forthcoming UN climate summit in Morocco in November. \"Climate change threatens all dimensions of food security,\" Mr Graziano da Silva warned. \"It will expose both urban and rural poor to higher and more volatile food prices. It will also affect food availability by reducing the productivity of crops, livestock and fisheries.\" He stated: \"Hunger, poverty and climate change need to be tackled together.\" Follow Mark on Twitter.",

        "article": "A mournful procession of about 1,500 Latvians winds its way through Riga's medieval Old Town singing traditional Latvian songs. Elderly World War Two veterans lead the crowd. And many of the participants are carrying flowers to lay at the Freedom Monument, Latvia's symbol of national independence. They have come here to commemorate those who died defending Latvia against the Soviet Union in the war. But with Russian troops now in nearby Ukraine, many in the Baltics are alarmed that history may be about to repeat itself. \"If Ukraine falls, then Russian ambitions won't stop with this. I believe we will be next in Russia's list of actions,\" said one young man who had come to take part in the procession. \"It shows the attitude of Russia - how it goes into another country very easily and acts in an aggressive manner,\" said another. But this annual memorial service is highly controversial. These elderly veterans fought against Russia - but for Nazi Germany. The Baltics have spent much of their history being buffeted between neighbouring imperial forces. And in WWII, having already suffered severe oppression under Stalin, many Latvians saw Hitler's forces as the lesser of two evils - Latvia's only chance of not slipping back into Stalinist oppression. But the veterans and their supporters are accused of being Nazi sympathisers - particularly by Latvia's large Russian-speaking community. About 1,000 Russian-speakers have gathered behind police barricades near the monument to protest. \"Fascists go home!\" shout some. \"Shame! Shame!\" shout others. This year security is particularly tight, with as many police officers as participants, amid fears that the instability in Ukraine will spark ethnic tensions here. It is a similar dynamic to Ukraine: pro-Moscow local Russian-speakers accusing pro-Western nationalists of being right-wing extremists. And like Ukraine, some Russian-speakers here say they are discriminated against by mainstream society. \"I feel like a person who is second-class,\" says Aleksandr Gaponenko, a Russian-speaker who moved to Soviet-era Latvia with his parents 59 years ago, when he was a one-year-old. \"We want equal rights for our languages, and we want equal social and economic rights.\" Latvia country profile According to the Latvian authorities, throughout the 20th Century people from elsewhere in the USSR were resettled in the Baltics as a deliberate Soviet policy to water down Baltic culture and destroy local national sentiment. And still today Russian-speakers are sometimes pejoratively called \"occupiers\". So when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, Mr Gaponenko, like many Russians, was not automatically granted Latvian citizenship, and lost his job in Riga city council. Today he is classed as a \"non-citizen\" - which means he is still not allowed to work for the state and does not have the right to vote. Around 300,000 Russian-speakers, or 13% of Latvia's population, are so-called \"non-citizens\". And they live in an EU member state and member of Nato. To become Latvian, they have to prove their knowledge of the Latvian language and culture in a citizenship test - even if they were born here. Some Russian-speakers, such as Mr Gaponenko, refuse to take the test, saying that the country where they have spent all their lives should grant them citizenship automatically. Others, particularly older people, say they do not speak Latvian well enough to pass the test. But the Latvian government says it is encouraging all residents of Latvia to become citizens. And it accuses the Kremlin of using the issue to stir up resentment within the local Russian-speaking population and create political instability. \"There's massive propaganda, even an information warfare - not only here, and not only using Russian-speaking media, but also using other channels,\" says Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics. Russian-speakers often live very separate lives from their Latvian neighbours, living in different neighbourhoods, often socialising in different places. In Riga city centre, one bar might be full of local Russian-speakers, next door packed with ethnic Latvians. Estimates of numbers of Russian-speakers vary. According to Latvian pollster SKDS, Russian-speakers make up 42% of the population in Latvia, with 58% described as ethnic Latvian. This split in society is exacerbated by the political system. The parties popular with ethnic Latvian voters manage to form convoluted governing coalitions to stay in power. Meanwhile Harmony Centre, a party voted for mainly by Russians-speakers, is stuck in opposition - despite having won more votes than any other single party in the last parliamentary elections of 2011. Most problematic, says political analyst and pollster Arnis Kaktins, is that Russian-speakers often consume all their news from media produced in Moscow, while ethnic Latvians tend to get their information from Latvian or Western news outlets. So the two communities are developing opposing views about who is to blame for the crisis in Ukraine. \"When so many people rely heavily on Russian news sources, it means that Russia has an instrument to change their minds if it would like to,\" says Mr Kaktins. There is a fear that the Kremlin could encourage Latvia's predominantly Russian-speaking border regions to follow Crimea's example and break away from Latvia to join Russia. All three Baltic States are in Nato, so it is seen as unlikely that the Kremlin would send in troops, and start a conflict that the West would feel obliged to respond to militarily. The real worry is that the crisis could increase divisions within Latvian society. Since independence in 1991, Latvia's two communities have lived side-by-side peacefully. But if the conflict in Ukraine gets worse, the rift could grow between Russian-speakers who support Russia's President Vladimir Putin, and ethnic Latvians who support the West.",

The Spaniard, 27, spent three years at Barca and joins the Blues after Arsenal turned down a first option to buy him. Fabregas joins for an undisclosed fee and said Chelsea matched his football ambitions, adding he had \"unfinished business\" in the Premier League. \"I considered all the other offers very carefully and I firmly believe that Chelsea is the best choice,\" he said. While the fee for the move is unknown, the Spanish club were happy for Fabregas to leave for a fee in the region of \u00a330m. His arrival comes 10 days after England midfielder Frank Lampard announced he would end his 13-year stay at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho is also keen to finalise the transfer of Spanish international Diego Costa from Atletico Madrid, as he bids to improve on his side's third-place finish in 2013-14. \"Twelve months ago, Fabregas was not prepared to let his Barcelona dream die by joining Manchester United. Now he has decided the time is right for a return to the Premier League. \"At Chelsea he will be filling the role of Frank Lampard, who signed off this summer after  13 glorious years when he won three Premier League titles, the Champions League and became the club's highest scorer. \"That is the legacy Fabregas will be expected to live up to. Jose Mourinho will demand it.\" \"They have an amazing squad of players and an incredible manager,\" added Fabregas, who has 89 caps for Spain. \"I am fully committed to this team and I can't wait to start playing.\" Fabregas, who scored 50 times in 305 games for Arsenal during his previous spell in England, will wear the number-four shirt and join Ramires, Nemanja Matic and John Obi Mikel as central midfield options for Mourinho. He scored 35 goals in 129 appearances for Barcelona, but it failed to earn him a regular midfield role at the Nou Camp, with the trio of Xavi Hernandez, Andres Iniesta and Sergio Busquets viewed as the club's main central combination. Still Arsenal's youngest ever player at just 16 years and 177 days, Fabregas was expected to have been subject of a bid from his former club. But with Jack Wilshere, Aaron Ramsey, Mesut Ozil, Mikel Arteta and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain all able to fulfil central roles, Gunners manager Arsene Wenger chose not to sign the man he made captain in 2008. \"Yes, everyone knows that Arsenal had the first option to sign me,\" added Fabregas, who said it was \"extremely important\" the move was completed before the World Cup finals. Media playback is not supported on this device \"They decided not to take this option and therefore it wasn't meant to be. I wish them well in the future.\" Chelsea look set to lose defender David Luiz to Paris St-Germain after a deal was agreed for the Brazilian, but goalkeeper Petr Cech welcomed the signing of Fabregas. \"Obviously he's a great player, with a lot of experience of playing in England and the Premier League so it's a great addition to the team,\" said Cech. Barcelona schooled Fabregas in their La Masia academy from the age of 10 and thanked him for \"his professionalism and dedication during his years at the club\". He could feature in Spain's World Cup opener against Netherlands on Friday, with team-mate Xavi calling the move \"a great opportunity\". \"He's looking very happy now and he knows what his future holds in store for the next few years,\" said Xavi, although he added that it was a big loss for Barcelona to see Fabregas leave.",

Mr Gill has been criticised by some in the party for \"double-jobbing\". Asked on BBC Radio's Good Evening Wales programme if he would give up one of the jobs if asked, he replied: \"Absolutely, but it has to be for a purpose.\" Mr Gill said \"it would have to be the leader\" asking him to quit a role. Mr Nuttall won the party's leadership contest on Monday, promising to target Labour voters in the north of England. He took 9,622 votes with 62.6% of support among party members. The AM for North Wales sits as an independent in the Senedd after falling out with the UKIP assembly group leader Neil Hamilton. UKIP's ruling national executive committee had earlier agreed to hold a ballot of Welsh members on whether Mr Gill should continue to be both an AM and an MEP. But Mr Gill claimed the new leader did not want the ballot to happen. He told BBC Wales: \"I've spoken to Paul about this and Paul tells me he doesn't want a ballot to go ahead. I don't see what it's going to achieve.\" Mr Gill said \"disgruntled left-behind Labour voters\" were a target for UKIP. He added: \"Nigel Farage was able to speak to those people and he is a Dulwich [public school] boy. \"Now if Nigel can speak to those people then without a doubt Paul Nuttall from Bootle on Merseyside absolutely can and will.\" Mr Hamilton said: \"I think Paul Nuttall has a very good chance of appealing very widely to ex-Labour voters... because he comes from an authentic working-class background in Liverpool. \"I think Paul can win over Welsh Labour voters, perhaps with a bit of help from me and my colleagues in the assembly.\" Mr Nuttall previously called for compromise between Mr Hamilton and Mr Gill. But Mr Hamilton said Mr Gill \"doesn't seem to accept that having been elected by the people of north Wales as one of the AMs that he should give his entire focus to this job\". \"There is no compromise on that. It's impossible,\" said the AM for Mid and West Wales. \"It's like pregnancy. You are either pregnant or you're not. You're either full time or you're not.\" Mr Hamilton supported Mr Nuttall in the leadership contest. He tweeted he was delighted Mr Nuttall, an MEP for North West England, had won the contest. Another AM, Mark Reckless, the UKIP member for South Wales East, said Mr Nuttall's comments about targeting Labour voters in the north of England \"touched on something with regard to south Wales.\" But Labour's Aberavon MP Stephen Kinnock said the British people were \"not going to be fooled\" by the new UKIP leader. \"Paul Nuttall will use his leadership to fight for a hard Brexit that would put jobs, growth and living standards at risk,\" he said. \"The best outcome for working people would be to reject UKIP's politics of division, and unite behind a progressive vision for our country that retains our unfettered access to the single market.\"",

It is one of a number of measures being considered by the government in its consultation on curbing corporate pay. Other proposals include improving the effectiveness of remuneration committees and votes on pay packages. It comes after Theresa May appeared to row back from plans to force companies to appoint employees to their boards. The government's green paper, published this week, aims to increase public trust in business in the face of the rise in anti-globalisation and anti-business sentiment. Its proposals will include: As part of the plan to reform remuneration committees, the government is considering whether employees' representatives should be given an advisory role. Officials believe their input would spell out to the committee the impact on the wider workforce of high levels of remuneration for top executives. In September trade union body the TUC said its research showed the average FTSE 100 boss was paid 123 times the average full-time salary, and that the median pay award of major FTSE 100 directors had risen by 47% in five years to 2015 to \u00c2\u00a33.4m. As part of the proposed shake-up, civil servants have looked at measures being taken in other countries including the US, France and Australia. A government source said: \"Businesses are a pillar of our society, creating employment opportunities and contributing significantly to funding our country's public services. \"The UK has led the world in corporate governance, but our strong reputation can only be maintained if government and business regularly reviews and upgrades our governance. \"Good governance helps companies take better decisions, for their own long-term benefit and the economy overall - ensuring public trust in British business and making sure the UK is the best place in the world to do business.\" The publication of the green paper comes after Mrs May was forced to reject claims she had watered down plans for workers to have a say in how their companies are run. She ruled out imposing the appointment of employees to company boards when she gave a talk to the CBI this week. Days later the the Bank of England's chief economist, Andy Haldane, joined company chiefs to reject proposals for annual binding votes on pay and the publication of pay ratios. The two ideas were among the prime minister's suggestions to address public unease about executive pay. A report by the Big Innovation Centre think tank argued that a binding vote would mean Britain's top firms losing out on top talent. It also said that pay ratios do not \"lend themselves to valid comparisons between companies\" and would likely add to misunderstanding over executive pay as well as potentially creating \"perverse incentives\". Instead, the report argued for less complex pay structures, a \"Fair Pay Charter\" and giving shareholders more say on executive pay.",

        "article": "Jayaram Jayalalitha was the undisputed leader of the governing party in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, but her sudden death has raised questions over who will replace her and what direction the party will take. It will take a while for supporters and other leaders of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam party, or AIADMK, to come to terms with the huge void created by the death of Jayalalitha, one of India's most flamboyant and controversial leaders. The party, founded in 1972 by the charismatic MG Ramachandran, known as MGR, a film star turned politician, has been playing a crucial role in providing political stability in Tamil Nadu, which is among the most important Indian states economically and politically. Jayalalitha's death has triggered an air of uncertainty among the 75 million Tamils who have been used to seeing the AIADMK either as a governing party or as the main opposition for nearly four decades. Political stability has played a key role in Tamil Nadu's development over the years.  Its economy has been growing at a rate of around 12% in the past 10 years, much higher than the national average of around 8%. Tamil Nadu is also the second largest economy among Indian states, next only to Maharashtra. Its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2015 was estimated to be around $150bn (\u00c2\u00a3119bn). And as a whole, GDP per person in Tamil Nadu is 68% higher than the national average of $1,390 (\u00c2\u00a31,102) a year. For the moment, one of Jayalalitha's trusted lieutenants, O Panneerselvam, has taken over as chief minister. The smooth transition of power has surprised everyone. But there are challenges ahead. \"The party does not have any other leader who is similarly charismatic or popular. That is a vacuum. Right from its inception, the AIADMK has had popular leadership. For the first time, the party does not have a popular figure,\" says Gnani, a veteran political analyst. It is well known that there is no second - or even third - line of leadership in the party. The AIADMK flourished and succeeded mainly because of the charisma of Jayalalitha after she took over the party in 1990. At the helm, she never allowed anyone to challenge her and those who showed signs of rebellion were summarily dismissed. As a woman leader in a male-dominated society, she stamped her authority to instil respect or even fear among her party's men. Her autocratic style led to her ministers and senior party members prostrating in front of her in public, sometimes even in front of her car, to get her blessing or attention. The AIADMK leadership - both MGR and Jayalalitha - appealed directly to its supporters, mostly in rural and semi-urban areas. The middle-level leaders were usually hand-picked and most of them had no political base of their own. The winning formula was achieved by offering free tablets, bicycles, televisions and money, and also by striking alliance with smaller or caste-based political parties. The party's election symbol, Two Leaves, introduced by MGR, is still a powerful tool to attract votes. There is speculation that Jayalalitha's long-time friend and confidante Sasikala Natarajan is likely to play a crucial role in the party's affairs and establish a power structure around her. Though she was close to the former leader, Mrs Natarajan was never given any official position by Jayalalitha. Mrs Natarajan and her family members are influential within the party, but they do not have any political base of their own. If there is any trouble within the party over the growing influence of Mrs Natarajan, that will work to the advantage of the main opposition in Tamil Nadu, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK). It is not uncommon in Tamil Nadu politics to engineer a split in the rival camp to bring down the government. Some regional leaders of the AIADMK, who were sidelined by Jayalalitha, may use the opportunity to stage a comeback and demand ministerial berths. Any infighting within the AIADMK is also likely to have an impact at the national level politics. In the past two decades, India's political direction has been dictated by powerful regional parties and the AIADMK was one of them. It took 30 years for a single party to achieve an outright majority in the Indian parliament, in 2014. Support of the regional parties was crucial in the formation of a national coalition government. But the political equation changed after Narendra Modi led the BJP to power two years ago. Whether in a coalition or not, an assertive Jayalalitha never hesitated for a moment to take on the central government, even eclipsing her mentor MGR. She castigated the federal government over their stance on the Sri Lankan Tamil issue or the Cauvery river water sharing dispute with neighbouring Karnataka state. There are concerns now that a weak AIADMK beset by internal squabbles will reduce the party's influence in central policies affecting the state. \"Regional parties have already lost their influence after the BJP got an absolute majority in parliament. If infighting erupts within the AIADMK, it will diminish the power and political leverage of the AIADMK. But the BJP still needs their support in the Rajya Sabha (Upper House) to pass crucial bills and laws,\" says AR Venkatachalapathy, historian and professor at the Madras Institute of Development Studies. If nothing goes wrong, the present AIADMK government is expected to complete its full term and the next state assembly elections are scheduled for 2021.  The challenge for the AIADMK will be how it will face the electorate if there is any election in the interim period. The two Dravidian parties - AIADMK and DMK - have been ruling the state for nearly five decades. The national parties, like Congress and the BJP, have been waiting for decades to make inroads in Tamil Nadu. Is it the right moment? \"It AIADMK weakens, then the main opposition DMK will benefit. I don't think any national party (like Congress or the BJP) will benefit from the situation. The DMK will move into the space,\" says N Ram, former editor-in-chief of the Hindu newspaper. Tamil Nadu has witnessed lots of political drama over the years, but it is now entering a new phase and getting used to a life without Ms Jayalalitha for the first time in 35 years. More twists and turns are on the cards.",

Up to six shots were fired at police during a third night of violence in north Belfast on Tuesday. Petrol bombs and a pipe bomb were also thrown by nationalist rioters in the Ardoyne area. About 100 officers used water cannon and baton rounds. The prime minister has said the PSNI behaved in a brave and restrained way during the recent trouble. Speaking in the Commons, Prime Minister David Cameron described the violence as \"unacceptable\" and said the PSNI had been forced to respond. On Wednesday, Assistant Chief Constable Duncan McCausland said children as young as 10 were involved in the violence. He said as well as throwing stones and petrol bombs, young children were being used as shields by \"sinister elements\" organising the riots behind them. ACC McCausland said police had hours of video footage from before the violence started and would use it to identify the rioters. \"There will be significant arrests in the forthcoming days - individuals will not go scot free,\" he said. The rioter who dropped a concrete block on a policewoman on Monday night - seriously injuring her - had already been identified he added. \"Wherever he is in Northern Ireland he can sit and be worried - we will be coming for him,\" he said. The officer is due to get out of hospital later on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the NI first and deputy first ministers have met the chief constable. Following the meeting, Peter Robinson said he had \"nothing but the highest admiration for the way the police has dealt with the difficulties of recent days\". Martin McGuinness described the violence as a \"setback against the huge progress we have made in recent times\". But he insisted that those behind the violence \"would not succeed\" in disrupting the political process. The NI Chief Constable, Matt Baggott, said his force was determined to bring those responsible to justice. Mr Robinson and Mr McGuinness were criticised on Tuesday by Assistant Chief Constable Alistair Finlay, who called on them to provide more leadership. On Wednesday, searches were carried out in the Ardoyne area in relation to the recent trouble and a number of items were taken away for further examination. A 20-year-old man was also charged with riotous behaviour in connection with an incident during an Orange Order march in the Ormeau Road area on 12 July. He is due to appear at Belfast Magistrates Court on Thursday. On Tuesday night in Ardoyne, burning barricades were put in place and laser pens were shone at police. Some officers suffered minor injuries. Politicians have condemned the violence, which has flared at the height of the loyalist marching season. Sinn Fein have said dissident republicans and \"anti-social elements\" are behind the violence. SDLP councillor Nicola Mallon spent most of Tuesday night in Ardoyne and said it as a night of \"absolute madness and mayhem\" with local residents growing increasingly worried about the situation. Northern Ireland's Justice Minister David Ford said there was an \"extremely sinister edge\", in terms of those who were encouraging the rioting. There was also trouble in North Queen Street area of north Belfast on Tuesday night where youths built a barricade across the road. In the Markets area of south Belfast a bus was damaged by stone-throwers and a car was recovered by police as youths tried to hijack it. A car was also stolen in Lurgan, County Armagh and four petrol bombs were thrown at a police vehicle in Londonderry. More than 80 police officers had been injured over the previous two nights of rioting by nationalist youths. Police later released aerial footage of the violence, which showed officers coming under sustained attack from people throwing bricks and wielding metal bars and planks. The chief constable, Matt Baggott, said the cost of policing Monday's violence would run into millions of pounds.",

        "article": "The centenary year of playwright Arthur Miller's birth is being marked with an explosion of productions around the UK in 2015. One of the first out of the blocks is a touring production of All My Sons by black-led theatre company Talawa. The story centres on all-American couple Joe and Kate Keller, whose son is missing after World War Two. Its director Michael Buffong tells arts correspondent Tim Masters what makes the play a 20th Century classic. What does it mean to you to be taking All My Sons on the road in Miller's centenary year? The fact that it's a centenary year shines an even brighter spotlight on what is an amazing piece of work and an amazing writer. We originally performed this in 2013 and I'd love to say I planned the tour for the centenary, but the truth of it is that it's a coincidence. What makes All My Sons an American classic? The themes are so universal. On one level it's about chasing the dream and the cost of trying to live it. The themes that come out of the play are issues of loyalty and trust and betrayal, and secrets within families and how people collude and how ultimately everything can come falling down. The themes are so universal - what would you do for your family? Joe Keller thinks anything is forgivable because it's been done for his family but he doesn't have a wider social responsibility. That's his downfall. The 2013 production earned five star reviews - does that add pressure to taking it out two years later? I haven't thought about it. If I did I might not sleep too well. I guess it might add a bit of pressure. I read reviews, you can't help it. One has to be able to take them - the good and the bad. Given that it was such a hit, how much are you tweaking this time round? Like with any fantastic play once you get to revisit it you realise its depth - we are finding so many new things. Half the cast are different so it can't be the same because they bring new elements. It just goes to show the quality of the text: there's always more to unearth. Does having a black cast give the play a new perspective? It certainly gives it a nuance. If you think of a black family trying to achieve the American dream suddenly the stakes become higher still because of black history in the US. But it essentially remains the same story: it's a family drama, and this family is an all-American family. You took over Talawa in 2012 - are there still things you want to achieve? I'm just at the beginning. The past three years have been great and we are starting to achieve some of things we set out to do. It's great that we get do do All My Sons, and we get to work with the companies like the  National Theatre as we did last year with Moon on a Rainbow Shawl. We've got a writers' programme working with the Bush and Soho Theatres and the BBC, and we have a space we are desperate to develop into a 100-seat venue. We are looking for funding to do that. What's the latest on workshops you've had with Lenny Henry on a play about the American comedian Richard Pryor? We are still in the workshopping process. It's in development. I hope it will come to the stage. We are both keen to see it happen. All My Sons, with a cast led by Ray Shell and Dona Croll, has opened at Ipswich's New Wolsey Theatre, and tours until 25 April. A full list of tour dates is on the Talawa website. Following its sell-out run at the Young Vic, A View from the Bridge, with Mark Strong leading the cast, opens at the West End's Wyndham's Theatre on 16 February, and is now in preview. The RSC's production of Miller's 1949 Pulitzer prize-winning Death of a Salesman begins previews in March at Stratford-upon-Avon, with Antony Sher and Alex Hassell as father and son, Willy Loman and Biff. Sian Phillips leads the cast of Sheffield Theatres' revival of Arthur Miller's Playing for Time from 12 March - 4 April at the Crucible. A drama originally written by Miller for the big screen, The Hook - about corruption in New York's docks - has its world premiere at Northampton's Royal and Derngate theatre on 5-27 June.",

        "article": "Half of all UK seven-year-olds do not do enough exercise, with girls far less active than boys, a study suggests. University College London researchers found just 51% of the 6,500 children they monitored achieved the recommended hour of physical activity each day. For girls, the figure was just 38%, compared with 63% for boys. Half of the group also spent more than six hours being sedentary each day, although some of this would be spent in class, the researchers acknowledged. The study, published in the online journal BMJ Open, found levels of activity varied among groups. For example, children of Indian origin and those living in Northern Ireland were among the least physically active with 43% achieving the recommended levels, compared to 53% in Scotland. But the most marked difference was between girls and boys. Researchers said this suggested there needed to be a focus on making sport and other activities more attractive to girls. Prof Carol Dezateux, one of the lead authors, said: \"There is a big yawning gap between girls and boys. We need to really think about how we are reaching out to girls. \"The school playground is an important starting point. Often you will find it dominated by boys playing football.\" But she said there should still be concern about the activity levels across the board. \"The findings are particularly worrying because seven-year-olds are likely to become less active as they get older, not more.\" To achieve the one hour recommendation children have to take part in moderate or vigorous activity, which includes everything from brisk walking and cycling to playing football and running. The UCL research is not the first to suggest children are not active enough, but most previous studies have relied on self-reporting by children or parents estimating levels of exercise, whereas the latest one involved real-time monitoring. During the study, which took place during 2008 and 2009, youngsters wore an accelerometer to measure exercise levels which was attached to an elastic belt around their waist. It was removed only when bathing or when the children went to bed. In total, the experts were able to record more than 36,000 days of data based on the children wearing the accelerometer for at least 10 hours a day over the course of a week. Dr John Middleton, of the Faculty of Public Health, said more research was needed into why certain groups were less active. \"We need our children to grow up to be fit and healthy adults, not just because it's what any civilised society would want for its children, but it's also best for our economy too,\" he added. Dr Ann Hoskins, of Public Health England, agreed. She said: \"This study highlights that there is still much to do to keep children and young people active as they grow older, especially girls. \"The new school year is the perfect time to make healthy changes, swapping short car or bus journeys with walking or scooting to school.\"",

        "article": "The US space agency (Nasa) has launched a mission to retrieve a rock sample from a 500m-wide asteroid called Bennu. Scientists hope the material will reveal details about the formation of the planets, and improve our knowledge of how potentially dangerous space objects move through the Solar System. The probe, dubbed Osiris-Rex, blasted away from Florida on an Atlas rocket at 19:05 local time (00:05 BST). It will be seven years before it returns to Earth with its bounty. This will be delivered in a capsule that will be parachuted down to the Utah desert on 24 September 2023. It is not the first such sample-return mission - the Japanese brought back a tiny amount of dust from asteroid Itokawa in 2010. But the Americans hope to acquire considerably more material, weighing perhaps a few hundred grams. Engineers have developed a collection device that will extend from Osiris-Rex on a robotic arm and \"high five\" the surface of Bennu. On contact, the mechanism will deliver a burst of gas to kick up loose fragments that should then settle in a holding chamber prior to being packed away in the return capsule. Asteroids are left-overs from the original building blocks of the Solar System. As such they should still retain clues to the events that brought the Sun and the planets into being. Bennu is a so-called \"B-type\" asteroid. It is very dark. Telescope observations suggest it is rich in carbon compounds. \"For primitive, carbon-rich asteroids like Bennu, materials are preserved from over 4.5 billion years ago. We're talking about the formation of our Solar System,\" explained Christina Richey, Nasa's Osiris-Rex deputy programme scientist. \"And these primitive materials could contain organic molecules that may be the precursors to life here on Earth or elsewhere within our Solar System.\" Sample-Return missions are the future of space exploration, believes UK mission scientist Ian Franchi. The range of studies that can be conducted back on the Earth is far broader than can be pursued in-situ by a probe. \"The instruments we use in the lab are the size of family cars or bigger if you think of synchrotron facilities,\" he told BBC News. \"They require amazing temperature control or very sophisticated sample preparation techniques. \"These are all things you just cannot do robotically on a spacecraft. And the other big issue is dating - we have to understand when something's happened and that chronology work has to be done in an Earth lab.\" Osiris-Rex - Mission to Asteroid Bennu Osiris-Rex will spend at least 2.5 years at Bennu. One of its tasks in this time will be to measure accurately something called the \"Yarkovsky effect\". This describes how an asteroid will alter its path through the Solar System when its surface is heated by the Sun. \"It has to radiate that energy back out into space, and when that happens it acts like a thruster and changes the trajectory of the asteroid,\" said Dante Lauretta, the mission's principal investigator from the University of Arizona, Tucson. \"If you want to be able to predict where an object like Bennu is going to be in the future, you have to account for this phenomenon.\" The effect is tiny, but over the centuries could make the difference between a threatening asteroid either hitting or a missing the Earth.

Rosberg has won the first three races of the season to build a commanding 36-point lead in the championship. Hamilton said: \"Of course there is an urgency. I can't really afford to fall any further back than that. \"Who knows how the weekend will go? It could be as bad as in the past but I'm hoping it will be positive.\" Hamilton has finished second, third and seventh in the races so far. Bad starts took him out of the reckoning for victory in the first two races in Australia and Bahrain and then in China technical trouble left him at the back of the grid, from where he was involved in a crash at the first corner. Formula 1 has introduced new rules this season that gives the drivers more control at starts, reducing the technical assistance they get from the car. And Hamilton said he had been encouraged before Sunday's race in Sochi by the fact he had made a good start in Shanghai from his position at the back of the grid. \"I made the best start,\" he said. \"At the end of the weekend the team analyse the starts and I had the best of everyone, they told me. \"This is a circuit where you need that because I think it is one of the longest runs to Turn One and it is easy to get drafted so a good start would help.\" Rosberg, who has won won six grands prix in a row dating back to last October in Mexico, said he was expecting a fightback from Hamilton over the remaining 18 races. \"I'm pleased with the way I'm driving,\" he said. \"For me it's not six straight, it's three, because I only count from the start of this season. \"I have been driving really well but my opposition had a really messy start and I definitely expect them to bounce back, especially Lewis.

Taunton frustrated the hosts in the first half, with Barrow defenders Nick Anderton and Danny Livesey both having headers cleared off the line in quick succession. Williams then fired wide while Palmer had a free-kick deflected over.

If you are an ardent Brexiteer, stop before your blood pressure goes through the roof.  If you are a passionate Remainer, stop before you crack open the French (not English of course) champagne. What follows is an unlikely, a very unlikely turn of events. But it is not impossible that our decision to leave the European Union could end up being judged in the European Court in Luxembourg. Yes, that same court so despised by Eurosceptics could, in theory, fight to keep us in their clutches. As my colleagues have reported, the government is already fighting a challenge in the courts, an effort to make ministers accept that Parliament, not the prime minister, must decide when to trigger Article 50 - that's the legal mechanism that begins the likely tortuous process of us actually leaving the EU. Without going into the details, which you can read about here, the claimants are arguing that the PM has to get MPs' permission to go ahead with it. The government's lawyers claim that she is perfectly within her rights to do so under the ancient principles of the Royal Prerogative. A senior government source says it seems to be \"60-40\" in their favour, with the judgement expected in the next week or so. But both sides are likely to appeal immediately to the Supreme Court for a further ruling, and it's here that things could get interesting. Both the government and the claimants have assumed that the Article 50 process can't be stopped once it has started. But not all lawyers agree, with some even arguing that Article 50 could legally be stopped in its tracks. Although that question is not a bone of contention in this particular case, it is possible that the Supreme Court judges think that it ought to be part of the arguments. If they do? Well, that question is a point of European, not British, law. And, of course, European laws are not decided in the grand building opposite Big Ben but, you guessed it, in the European Court in Luxembourg. That wouldn't just have huge consequences for the Article 50 court case, but for the whole tricky political dynamics of Brexit. George Peretz QC explains the legalities here, including why it is not that likely that the Supreme Court will take what would be seen as a provocative action. And politically, as well as legally, a referral to Luxemburg is not a good bet. In these strange times, though, neither is it an outcome that can be totally dismissed, complete with the huge political consequences that it could provoke. As they pulled a horrified face, one minister said to me: \"Imagine if Luxemburg stops Brexit!\" As the government battles to hold its line, imagine indeed.",

Accountant in Bankruptcy (AiB) reported 2,405 insolvencies between April and June - 7.8% up on the previous quarter. There were 1,144 bankruptcies, which was up 14.7% on the previous quarter and 51.1% more than a year ago. However, AiB said the figures showed a \"return to trend\". A year ago, the number of personal insolvencies in Scotland fell to its lowest level for more than 14 years following the introduction of the Bankruptcy and Debt Advice (Scotland) Act. The legislation introduced new measures such as mandatory money advice for people seeking access to statutory debt relief solutions such as sequestration. Although the latest bankruptcy figures were sharply up on a year ago, they were 41.7% lower than the same quarter in 2013-14 and 34.9% lower than in 2014-15. Personal insolvencies include both bankruptcies and protected trust deeds (PTDs). The number of PTDs recorded between April and June remained largely stable at 1,261, a 2.1% increase from the previous quarter. New debt payment programmes approved under the Debt Arrangement Scheme (DAS) fell slightly by 5.2% on the previous quarter, to 510. Quarterly figures for bankruptcies and PTDs since 2005-06: Business Minister Paul Wheelhouse said: \"These figures indicate that people are becoming more accustomed to the new insolvency legislation and processes. \"We are now seeing the numbers settling down to a more regular pattern following the significant, and expected, drop after the introduction of the new laws. \"Compared to the same quarter from two years ago, prior to these changes, the number of people falling into insolvency today is down by more than a third. \"This shows those most in need can access the debt relief they require to help them on the road to a fresh financial start - but also that the long term movement is a downward one.\" Eileen Blackburn, from insolvency trade body R3, said: \"This quarterly rise, driven mostly by an increase in bankruptcies, bucks the wider downward trend in Scottish personal insolvencies we've seen in past years. \"The number of insolvencies have been falling steadily since their peak in 2012, and this quarter represents a return to more stable levels. \"The rise is probably less do with the EU referendum result, which only happened towards the very end of the quarter, and more to do with ongoing difficulties in the Scottish economy and the end of the financial year in March.\"",

The blast tore through the crowded Jameela market in the predominantly Shia district of Sadr City. The Sunni jihadist group, Islamic State (IS), said it was behind the bombing and that it targeted Shia militiamen. Meanwhile, medics say more than 20 civilians died when bombs dropped by the Iraqi air force hit a maternity and children's hospital in Falluja. The city lies west of Baghdad and has been controlled by IS since January 2014. The violence comes after a top American general said the US should consider embedding American troops with Iraqi forces if progress was not made in the fight against IS. Raymond Odierno, the army's outgoing chief of staff, told reporters that such forces would have a support rather than a combat role. Thursday's bomb attack in Sadr City was one of the deadliest in the capital since Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi took office a year ago. In a statement posted on Twitter, IS said the truck bomb targeted Shia militiamen from the Mahdi Army and the Popular Mobilisation forces, who have been battling the jihadist group in northern and western Iraq for more than a year. Sadr City has been the target of several bomb attacks this year claimed by IS militants, who consider Shia to be heretics. Dozens of people have been killed in bombings across Baghdad in recent months. In May and July, large car bombs exploded outside two prominent hotels. IS also continues to control vast swathes of territory in northern and western Iraq, but air strikes by a US-led coalition have helped Iraqi pro-government forces regain some territory since last August. \"I believe that if we find in the next several months that we're not making the progress that we have, we should probably absolutely consider embedding some soldiers with them, and see if that would make a difference,\" said Gen Odierno, who retires as US Army chief of staff on Friday. \"I think that's an option we should present to the president.\" Gen Odierno warned that swift and more aggressive US military action would be effective only in the short-term. \"We'd probably be right back where we are today six months later,\" he said. \"I absolutely believe that the region has to solve this problem. The US cannot solve this problem for the region.\" The US has already sent some 3,500 military trainers and advisers to Iraq. But the Americans' aim of training 24,000 Iraqi troops has not been achieved, with only 9,000 coming forward, according to US Defence Secretary Ashton Carter.",

        "article": "Palm oil giant Olam has been accused of using suppliers that may use unsustainable practices in parts of Southeast Asia. The claims against the agricultural commodities trader were made in a report by Mighty, a US-based environmental lobby group. Mighty also accuses Olam and its main stakeholder, Singapore state-owned investment company Temasek, of turning a blind eye to these practices. Both companies reject the allegations. Singapore and Malaysia regularly suffer from haze caused by slash-and-burn practices by small-scale farmers and rogue palm oil traders in Indonesia. Indonesia is often blamed for not doing enough to tackle the agriculture fires used to clear vegetation for palm oil, pulp and paper plantations in the Riau province in East Sumatra, South Sumatra, and parts of Kalimantan on Indonesian Borneo. Singapore-based Olam has confirmed that it buys 99% of its palm oil from third party suppliers and while it is a relative newcomer to the industry, it says it accounts for less than 1% of the global market. Mighty's report says Olam and Temask could be unwittingly encouraging unsustainable palm oil trading practices that may contribute to the haze that is caused by the fires. It also says Olam created a \"secretive market for rogue palm oil companies\" that allowed the vast majority of its product to be bought from unknown sources. But Olam chief executive Sunny Verghese told the BBC that the firm had a \"very vigorous sourcing policy and we insist that there is zero tolerance for burning, so it's a 'no burn-no peat-no deforestation' compliance policy\". The company only agreed to release the names of its 14 suppliers on Monday, having previously resisted calls by Mighty to do so. Mr Verghese said he believed the firm's current suppliers all met Olam's strict requirements, but added that the vetting and verification process would take several more years to complete. He added that producers who do not comply with the company's sustainable principles would be removed from its supply chain. Since Temasek is the majority stake holder in Olam, Mighty's allegations could link Singapore's state fund to the devastating annual haze affecting Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia - if the claims of sourcing from rogue palm oil producers are proven. Temasek's investment in Olam means that \"the people of Singapore have unwittingly financed what is likely one of the world's black boxes for the kind of unsustainably produced palm oil that fuels the haze,\" the report says. Temasek has dismissed the allegations, explaining that they \"fully support no-burn policies for land clearance, and would urge oil palm companies and plantation owners to do the same.\" The fund told the BBC: \"Olam's operations are properly matters for the board and management of Olam to address. \"As a matter of proper governance, Temasek does not direct the business operations of our portfolio companies, including Olam.\" It would be fair to say that the palm oil industry globally has a troubled track record. It is one of the world's biggest industries, projected to be worth $88bn by 2022 but also often accused of unfair and illegal labour practices, as well as deforestation and the burning of plantations. Green groups and palm oil executives often find themselves at loggerheads with one another - NGOs say that the industry is wilfully turning a blind eye to environmentally unfriendly practices, while palm oil executives claim it is an industry-wide problem, and policing third party suppliers is impossible. Activists say governments need to punish palm oil firms that don't comply with acceptable standards of protecting the environment - but changing the government mindset can be challenging, because the reality is many of these firms bring jobs and investment to rural areas. The report also highlights concerns in the African state of Gabon, where according to Mighty, Olam \"bulldozes rainforests to establish monoculture palm oil plantations,\" bringing the same practices to Africa \"that have destroyed vast natural landscapes in Southeast Asia\". In response to the accusation that Olam is responsible for vast forest clearings through its joint ventures with the government of Gabon, Olam said its private-public partnerships in the country strove to be both responsible and transparent. \"We agree with Gabon's sovereign right to convert a tiny percentage of its least valuable forested land for agriculture, so long as it is responsibly and transparently done,\" it said. \"Our plans and progress for developing sustainable palm oil plantations have been shared transparently with stakeholders and put in the public domain.\"",

Media playback is not supported on this device The 28-year-old, who won Olympic bronze in 2012, cleared 2.33m to finish second behind Italian Gianmarco Tamberi. Team captain Asha Philip was fifth in the women's 60m but Dina Asher-Smith suffered a minor hamstring injury in her semi-final and missed the final. And Lynsey Sharp and Adelle Tracey both failed to reach the 800m final. Sharp, the European and Commonwealth silver medallist, finished second in her heat, but her time of two minutes, 02.75 seconds was not quick enough to progress as a fastest loser. \"Even though it may not look like it was a success, to me it was because I've learned a lot,\" said the Scot. In May 2014, Grabarz questioned his future in the sport after a knee operation left him jumping, in his words, \"like a 16-year-old girl\" and that failing to clear 1.80m on his return to training was \"the most depressing day of his life\". However, a first-time clearance of 2.33m saw him beat Erik Kynard, the man who won silver at the London Olympics, on countback. \"I'm ecstatic, I just can't quite believe it,\" he said after winning Britain's third medal of the Championships. \"If someone said I'd get that result two years ago I wouldn't have believed it, I would have bitten their hand off.\" Media playback is not supported on this device American Barbara Pierre won the women's 60m title in 7.02secs - 0.02 ahead of Dutch favourite Dafne Schippers. Philip crossed the line in 7.14 seconds to miss out on a medal. \"I'm gutted,\" she said. \"I came here for a medal, I wanted a medal. I came fifth and I didn't run a personal best or a season's best.\" Asher-Smith's withdrawal from the final was a precautionary move, given the Rio Olympics are only five months away. American Ashton Eaton won his third successive heptathlon title to add to the pentathlon title won by his Canadian wife Brianne Theisen-Eaton the day before. It makes them the first married couple to win gold medals at the same world championships. \"I was thinking it doesn't matter what happens to me,\" said Eaton, who was born and lives in Portland. \"Brianne is the one that stole the show. I am really happy about that and proud of her,\" he added of his wife, who finally ended a frustrating run of second-place finishes at major championships. Eaton's winning total of 6,470 points in the seven-event competition was 188 clear of nearest rival Oleksiy Kasyanov of Ukraine. Meanwhile, in a meeting in Slovakia, Tom Bosworth broke the 20km walk British record, finishing in one hour 20 minutes and 41 seconds.

Media playback is not supported on this device Leicester's Selby, who beat Ding Junhui in last year's final, looked on course for a whitewash by going 8-0 ahead. Irishman O'Brien claimed the ninth and 11th to avoid becoming only the second player to exit without winning a frame, but Selby wrapped up the match. He will face either Wales' Ryan Day or China's Xiao Guodong in the next round. Selby has enjoyed a stellar season - claiming four ranking titles, including this month's China Open, though no player has followed that by winning the world title in the same season. The world number one made top breaks of 92, 77 and 66 as he began his attempt to win his third title at the Sheffield venue, which is holding the event for a 40th year. \"I'm very happy to get through and happy with the scoreline but my performance could have been better,\" Selby said. \"I was not killing enough frames off in the first visit and would have liked to have capitalised on them. \"I would like to win every tournament I play in. I am confident and I am playing well enough. \"Even if I don't play well, I have a never-say-die attitude and you have to scrape me off the table. \"I was gutted not to go 9-0 because I know the history that there has only been one whitewash here. I was devastated to go in after the first session at 8-1.\" Having made light work of O'Brien, Selby has almost a week off, returning to action next Saturday. Dubliner O'Brien came through qualifying by beating David Gilbert in a final-frame decider - the longest frame in snooker history, timed at two hours, three minutes and 41 seconds. But he struggled badly in the first-round encounter, managing a high break of just 32, although he avoided the ignominy of joining Eddie Charlton - who lost 10-0 to John Parrott in 1992 - as the only players not to win a frame at the championship. He has now lost six successive meetings against Selby, claiming just four frames in a run stretching back to 2006. \"When I won my first frame, it was good because the crowd were so supportive and willing me not to get the whitewash,\" said O'Brien. In an all-Scottish tie, qualifier Stephen Maguire claimed eight frames in a row to trounce Anthony McGill 10-2. Maguire, who has won five ranking titles, has fallen to 24th in the world but was in good scoring form, compiling breaks of 97, 66 and 60 to go through. Meanwhile, five-time champion Ronnie O'Sullivan was pegged back to a 5-4 lead over debutant Gary Wilson.

        "article": "AMs gather in the Senedd on Tuesday for arguably the most important announcement in the assembly calendar - the budget. Mark Drakeford will be presenting the Welsh Government's spending plans to AMs for the first time since he was installed as finance secretary. The last financial plan - for 2016/17 - saw cuts for local government but rises in funding for the NHS and education. This year's plan, as in previous years, is likely to be a story of how the government manages declining pots of Westminster cash and what priorities it has. Last year's budget came to almost exactly \u00a315bn, but for 2017/18 we are expecting that to shrink to something between \u00a314.6bn and \u00a314.8bn. That would amount to \u00a3200m-\u00a3400m less cash to spend. There are inevitably going to be cuts in some parts of the Welsh Government's budget. Wales cannot raise its own money through taxes yet and so does not have scope to raise extra money itself.  Apart from the proceeds of business rates, it gets all of its money from the UK government. Some small taxes - stamp duty and landfill tax - will be devolved by 2018, so this is the last budget where they will not be factored in. At the assembly election Labour - which came out as the largest party and leads the government which includes one Liberal Democrat minister - made a list of pledges which it will need to fund if it is going to keep them. The fact that the Welsh Government is operating a \"one-in, one-out\" approach to spending means every new thing being funded needs something else scrapped to pay for it. A few weeks ago First Minister Carwyn Jones said Labour would keep those promises - but warned there were going to be cuts. The government's five-year programme includes: Ministers always face pressure to boost funding for the NHS - and there could well be a boost for health in the budget. Last week experts warned that NHS Wales faces a \u00a3700m black hole in its finances in just three years time. Wales cut NHS funding in 2010 and for three years after that - leading to a torrent of criticism - but in recent years budgets have been rising. Currently health and social care account for 48% of the overall Welsh Government budget. Could this be the year that the budget for health services reaches 50% - or more? Meanwhile local government is lobbying for no further cuts to councils. Last year the Welsh Government cut the overall council budget by 2%, although it had felt it was quite generous compared to what happened in England. Given the possibility of difficult battles for Labour around the corner in next May's council elections, ministers might want to give county halls some respite this time. We know that Communities First is set for the axe - worth \u00a330m a year. The scheme has been the Welsh Government's flagship anti-poverty project for 15 years but Communities Secretary Carl Sargeant said he was not convinced it was effective. There are plenty of departments that could see their budgets trimmed - further education and economic development, maybe natural resources. Education Secretary Kirsty Williams has also expressed scepticism about the effectiveness of Schools Challenge Cymru - a fund aimed at underperforming schools. Could the \u00a320m scheme be coming to an end? Labour did not win a majority at the last assembly election and must govern by doing deals with others. Lib Dem Kirsty Williams is already on board with a cabinet post and Labour has an arrangement with Plaid Cymru where the two parties talk about policies in joint committees - a forum where the budget will have been discussed. Plaid leader Leanne Wood confirmed to BBC Wales on Monday that a deal had been done with Labour to back the budget. It could be the case that Labour will need to fund one or more of Plaid's manifesto commitments as the price for its support. The \"compact\" agreement which saw Plaid back Carwyn Jones's return as first minister listed a set of priorities where the two parties had something of a consensus. They included childcare and the delivery of new all-age apprenticeships, and increases to the number of healthcare workers and GPs.",

        "article": "Britain's rail passengers will see a 1.1% rise in average fares from 2 January, 2016, the Rail Delivery Group (RDG) has announced. The RDG, which represents train operators and Network Rail, said it was the smallest annual rise for six years. Regulated fares, which include season tickets, are capped at no more than July's RPI inflation rate of 1%. Unregulated fares, such as off-peak leisure tickets, can go up by as much as the train companies like. RDG chief Paul Plummer said: \"We know that nobody likes to pay more to travel by train, especially to get to work.\" But he added that money from fares now almost covers rail's daily operating costs. \"This allows government to focus its funding on building a bigger, better network when the railway is becoming increasingly important at driving economic growth, underpinning jobs, and connecting friends and families,\" Mr Plummer said. Under government rules, the rise in regulated fares was restricted to no more than the Retail Prices Index measure of inflation over the year to July, which was 1%. Over the long term, RPI has tended to record higher inflation than the other measure of rising prices, the Consumer Price Index, which was 0.1% during the year. The increases cover fares in England, Scotland and Wales. Northern Ireland is treated separately. Martin Abrams, of the Campaign for Better Transport, said more must be done to achieve a \"truly affordable railway\" as fares have risen by more than 25% in the last five years. \"To avoid pricing people off the railways, the train operating companies and the government need to work closely together to provide fairer, simpler and cheaper fares through flexible ticketing and making sure people are always sold the cheapest ticket available.\" Mr Abrams insisted it was \"simply unfair\" that flexible ticketing has not yet been introduced, leading many part-time workers to \"fork out for five-day season tickets which don't give them the same savings that full-time commuters get\". Rail Minister Claire Perry claimed the government's decision to link regulated fare increases to no more than RPI will save the average season ticket holder \u00a3425 by 2020. She added: \"Our plan for passengers is improving journeys for everyone. It's transforming the tickets people buy, how much they pay for them, the trains they sit on, how quickly they arrive and the stations they arrive in.\" But Mick Cash, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, said the rise was \"another kick in the teeth for the British passenger who is already paying some of the highest fares in Europe to travel on clapped out and overcrowded trains\". The increase would help ring-fence the profits of \"rip-off private rail companies who, once again, will be laughing all the way to the bank\". Today's rise is the smallest since 2010 and even that was a one-off blip before an election. Regulated fares have actually raced up by around 40% in the past decade, taking season tickets around the south east of England well into the \u00a34,000-\u00a35,000 mark. The whole point of letting the government regulate half our fares was to protect customers from big hikes by the train companies. They picked out the kind of tickets where people don't have much choice but to go by train. Like commuting into big cities. This is the third year now that fare rises have been limited to inflation and they'll be kept there for the rest of this parliament. But it comes after years of stinging rises.",

        "article": "Yacouba Toure and a couple of his friends have gathered around his crackling radio in Mali's historic city of Timbuktu, soon after French-led troops captured it from militant Islamists. They are sitting on the dusty steps of a hair salon, feet tapping to the rhythm of music. \"Music is a pleasure for us,\" Mr Toure says. \"We can now dance and do whatever we want: We can walk together with women, we can shout, we're the young people of Timbuktu, this is what we like doing.\" Music was banned under the strict Islamic law that militant Islamists imposed when they took over the ancient desert city last year. All traditional folklore and ceremonies that make Malian culture vibrant were declared blasphemous. Other people soon join Mr Toure's little gathering, and a man offers to make some tea. The militants banned men and women from mixing in public. Now, Karia Cisse, who is passing by with a basket full of smoked fish on her head, grabs a cup. \"We can chit-chat with our brothers, our friends, and even our boyfriends,\" she says. \"It's a real pleasure, we're so happy. I want to thank God.\" Residents of Timbuktu can again enjoy the simple things they were used to, before the city fell under Islamist control 10 months ago. They can also dress the way they want to. Women have swapped the full black niqab, or full-face veil, for colourful local pagnes, a piece cloth wrapped around the body to form a skirt. Most of them wear a thin scarf over their head, just as they had in the past. There is an incredible feeling that the people are slowly coming back to life here. However, many have also been quick to vent the frustration and anger built up over months, which, they say, felt like a lifetime. In pictures: Why Malians now love France Scenes of looting on Tuesday revealed the deep inter-communal grievances and raised concerns about possible reprisal attacks. Dozens of people were out in the streets breaking into shops owned by ethnic Arabs and Tuaregs, whom they accuse of having collaborated with the militant Islamists. Weapons and boxes of ammunition were pulled out of at least one shop. However, most Arabs and Tuaregs have already left Timbuktu in fear of violence. But it is also time to uncover the wounds inflicted by the militants. In the city centre, a local bank had been turned into the headquarters of the Islamic police. The symbol of the jihadis - marked with a Koran, an AK-47 rifle and a cutlass that militants had cemented into the wall - has been taken down. A tiny cash machine attached to the building around the corner was used as a cell. Why do we know Timbuktu? In pictures: Timbuktu manuscripts \"They threw me in and whipped me,\" says Salaka Djikke, 25. Ms Djikke was arrested at around 23:00 on New Year's Eve as she went for a romantic ride on her boyfriend's motorcycle. When they arrived in front of his house, her boyfriend saw four jihadis coming at them. She did not see them and got off the bike. \"He drove off and got away, but they rushed at me and whipped me.\" Ms Djikke was sentenced to 95 lashes. It was carried out in a public place, all for being caught with a man she was not married to. Her boyfriend managed to escape and reached the capital, Bamako. He could have been stoned to death had he been arrested. Despite the scars she bears, Ms Djikke says that she does not regret taking the risk. \"If they didn't hurt you, they'd hurt your sister or your brother. They terrorised the population,\" she says. \"Even living under Sharia, it shouldn't be a crime to fall in love with another person,\" she says.",

Speaking at the London Guildhall, Mr Valls said the British media consistently portrayed France as \"left-wing and anti-business\". Earlier in the day, Mr Valls met David Cameron in Downing Street. The two prime ministers spoke about the ongoing threat of European recruits to Islamic State, as well as economic co-operation. Mr Valls, a member of the French Socialist Party, was appointed prime minister by President Francois Hollande in March. Chancellor George Osborne was also in attendance. Mr Cameron said the two nations were \"strong allies\" who faced \"the same challenge in responding to Isil [Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant] in Iraq and Syria\". He added that although he and his French counterpart were from \"different political families\", he was confident \"there is a lot we can share in terms of experience about what needs to happen\" in the future. The two men also discussed immigration in the European Union. A Downing Street spokesman said: \"The prime minister raised the issue of free movement and said it should not be an unqualified right.\" \"The prime minister thanked Prime Minister Valls for their co-operation in stronger security measures at Calais, and they agreed that more should be done across Europe to reduce the pull factors and to get countries where migrants arrive first to take responsibility for them.\" In his speech to a group of financiers and executives in the City of London, Mr Valls said sections of the British media and business classes needed to get past a \"caricature\" of France. He opened the speech by saying: \"A French prime minister in the City is an event - a socialist French prime minister in the City is a revolution. \"Every day I read your press, I listen and I watch what is being said about France. Too often I see in some of your newspapers some bias, prejudices and attacks as well,\" he said, with a tendency to portray France as \"left-wing and anti-business\". He also referenced the comments of John Lewis managing director Andy Street, who apologised last week after describing France as a nation \"in decline\" and saying he would advise anyone with investments in the country to \"get them out quickly\". Mr Valls said on Monday: \"Let me remind this British businessman who all of a sudden had some sort of startling vision and said that France was finished. \"He has presented excuses and apologised, and I would like to thank him for doing that, because he had forgotten that France was the fifth-largest economy in the world and second in Europe.\" Describing his government as \"pro-business\", Mr Valls went on to say that the 75% tax rate on high earners introduced by President Hollande would be reversed next year. He also announced that shops and museums in France would soon be permitted to open on Sundays. The visit comes in the wake of news last week that the European Commission is likely to reject France's draft budget at the end of this month, invoking for the first time its power to demand changes to a national budget. The commission will do so to ensure France meets its deficit reduction target of ensuring the deficit is under 3% of GDP by 2015. Mr Valls said this was \"technically speaking simply not possible\", and the French government has said 2017 will be the earliest it can reach this goal.",

Christie would like to see a minimum of five home-grown players in every match squad and feels too many managers are afraid to play youngsters. \"It would make clubs put more resources into their youth systems,\" he told BBC Scotland. \"It would make managers give young boys a chance at an earlier age.\" Christie's son Ryan, now a Celtic forward, and midfielder Liam Polworth established themselves as teenagers at Inverness and Christie senior puts that down to the bravery of former manager John Hughes, who left the club this summer. \"I'll tell you right now that Liam Polworth and Ryan Christie would not have played at the time that they did had it not been for John Hughes having the guts to play them,\" said Christie. \"There is no way that [Hughes' predecessor] Terry Butcher would have played these boys. \"The club have now got Liam playing 30, 40 games a season and have made big money off the other lad, so they've been proved right. \"We've got good players in our youth system, but it takes a brave manager to play them. There should be a rule in Scottish football to do it. If we want to make the game better in this country, we need to do something about it. \"It's about giving them light at the end of the tunnel. It's not just at our club, but every club. Managers play it safe and tend to go for experienced boys and they don't do that on the continent. \"I've been to Switzerland, I've been to Italy, to Spain, to Greece, to see how they do it. They have a bigger emphasis on giving younger boys a chance, if they're good enough.\" Christie - who managed Caley Thistle between 2006 and 2007 - believes there are more youngsters in the Inverness youth set-up who have the potential to progress to the first team, now managed by Richie Foran. Like his son, Christie also joined Celtic during his playing career but he could not establish himself in the side and returned to playing in the Highlands. He was wary about his son making the same move, but says that he benefited from former Celtic manager Ronny Deila's coaching and can now flourish under his successor, Brendan Rodgers. \"Brendan has come in and Ryan has really bought into his ideas,\" Christie added. \"It's going to be difficult for him, they've got lots of good, quality, talented players. \"He wanted the challenge and feels he can better himself, become fitter, stronger, faster, and the good thing for me, speaking to the Scotland Under-21 coaches, when he played last year they felt he has improved.\"",

Media playback is not supported on this device The British pair entered through separate corridors at a Liverpool hotel on Monday and were divided by security for the traditional pre-fight face-off. Bellew, 34, called Haye \"a broken man\", as they repeatedly exchanged insults. Haye, 36, threw a punch at Bellew at a November media gathering and had warned they would need a barrier between them. WBC cruiserweight champion Bellew will fight at heavyweight for the first time, completing a two-division jump after competing at light-heavyweight as recently as 2013. Former WBA heavyweight champion Haye has had two routine wins since returning from over three years out of the sport. The London fighter seemed frustrated as fans in attendance drowned out his comments with songs on Monday - and he responded by insulting those in the crowd and said Liverpudlian Bellew would \"need all the support he can get\". An agitated Haye told the crowd: \"Deep in all of your tiny minds you know this guy is getting drilled to the canvas pretty fast.\" Bellew said: \"I am going in with a man who was absolutely fantastic. When he was in his prime, an immense athlete - but the tank is very, very low and it does not last very long. \"When the gas runs out, the big fat Scouser is going to steam through him.\" However, Haye's trainer, Shane McGuigan, predicted WBC cruiserweight champion Bellew would be \"cannon fodder\". Haye's wins since returning - both inside two rounds - prompted Dave Coldwell, Bellew's trainer, to question if the shoulder surgery he had in 2013 could hamper him in a longer contest. \"When you've had major surgery as an athlete, you are never the same man, you have doubts in your mind,\" said Coldwell, who once worked for Hayemaker promotions. \"Your surgeon advised you to retire, you come back but you don't know how you will perform on the night.\" Addressing his opponent, Bellew added: \"I've seen people have the operations you have had. Reconstructive shoulder surgery is a big thing, your right hand becomes a looping right hand.\" Bellew holds a record of 28 wins and a draw from 31 fights, with Haye boasting the same number of wins from 30 contests.",

        "article": "Campaigners have won the latest battle in legal action against the UK Government over levels of air pollution. A judge at the High Court in London ruled in favour of environmental lawyers ClientEarth. The group called air pollution a \"public health crisis\" and said the government has failed to tackle it. The ruling in the judicial review called the government's plan \"woefully inadequate\". The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) told the BBC that it accepted the court's judgment. ClientEarth won a separate, Supreme Court ruling against the government in April 2015. That judgment ordered ministers to come up with a plan to bring down air pollution to within legal limits as soon as possible. But ClientEarth was dissatisfied with those proposals, and took the government to the High Court in a judicial review. In the ruling on Wednesday morning, Mr Justice Garnham said the 2015 Air Quality Plan (AQP), devised when Liz Truss MP was Environment Secretary, failed to comply with the Supreme Court judgment and EU directives. Furthermore, the ruling said the government had erred in law by fixing compliance dates based on over-optimistic modelling of pollution levels. \"It seems to me plain that by the time the plan was introduced the assumptions underlying the Secretary of State's assessment of the extent of likely future non-compliance had already been shown to be markedly optimistic,\" said Mr Justice Garnham. He said the Secretary of State \"fell into error\" by fixing on a projected compliance date of 2020 (and 2025 for London). In particular, he drew attention to the cost implications of bringing in Clean Air Zones no earlier than 2020. \"The evidence demonstrates clearly that Clean Air Zones, the measure identified in the plan as the primary means of reducing nitrogen dioxide emissions, could be introduced more quickly than 2020,\" Mr Justice Garnham said. He continued: \"I have also seen a document setting out questions for Defra from HM Treasury dated 18 August 2015; one question asks why the money required 'needs to be spent over two years?' \"The answer given is 'spend does not have to be over two years, nine years is more realistic given that London does not need to be in compliance until 2025'.\" A raft of recent studies and reports have linked air pollution to heart disease and lung problems, including asthma. In February, the Royal Colleges of Physicians and of Paediatrics and Child Health said outdoor air pollution was contributing to some 40,000 early deaths a year in the UK. ClientEarth chief executive James Thornton commented: \"This is an urgent public health crisis over which the Prime Minister must take personal control. \"I challenge Theresa May to take immediate action now to deal with illegal levels of pollution and prevent tens of thousands of additional early deaths in the UK. The High Court has ruled that more urgent action must be taken.\" A spokesperson for Defra said its plans had always followed the best available evidence, adding: \"Whilst our huge investment in green transport initiatives and plans to introduce Clean Air Zones around the country will help tackle this problem, we accept the court's judgment. \"We will now carefully consider this ruling, and our next steps, in detail.\" The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said: \"Today's High Court ruling brings sharply into focus the scale of the country's air pollution crisis and lays the blame at the door of the Government for its complacency in failing to tackle the problem quickly and credibly. \"In so doing they have let down millions of people the length and breadth of the country.\" Follow Paul on Twitter.",

Wigan followed up Warrington's win over Brisbane to secure a first World Club Series victory for the northern hemisphere over Australia's NRL. Wane told BBC Radio 5 live sports extra: \"One thing we're good at in this country is looking for negatives. \"Let's be positive. Let's give Super League a pat on the back.\" National Rugby League clubs had won all six matches since the expanded World Club Series came into effect in 2015. Wane, whose side became the first from England to be crowned world champions since Leeds in 2012, added: \"Tony Smith did a great job with Warrington and we won fair and square. \"It's a fantastic feeling and I'm so pleased. The staff work hard but the players do their business out on the park. \"We did too much defending. I'm trying to stay positive and not think about how we played. I'm just glad to get the win.\" Wigan had lost to Brisbane in each of the past two seasons and lost their last World Club Challenge fixture to Sydney Roosters in Australia in 2014. But a hat-trick of tries from Joe Burgess against NRL champions Cronulla helped to add the 2017 title to those won by the Cherry and Whites in 1987, 1991 and 1994. Warrington made their second appearance in the World Club Series, having lost to St George Illawarra in 2015, and ended an eight-match losing streak for Super League clubs against their NRL counterparts with their win over the Broncos on Saturday. \"We realise it's big,\" said Wolves coach Smith. \"We knew that we were responsible for some of the credibility over here. They've shown that this is a good part of the world to play rugby league and we can play some pretty decent stuff. \"We want Super League to get stronger, but we also want to develop this concept as well. It would be great to go over and play the Broncos at their place. \"We're grateful they've come over here and given us the opportunity, and given our supporters the chance to see an iconic club play rugby league, and at the same time promote our sport worldwide.\" Many observers had concerns about the long-term future of the World Club Series because of the NRL's dominance in its first two years, but the Rugby Football League say discussions are ongoing about the make-up of the 2018 competition. A change of location and a return to the previous format of one match between the two competitions' respective champions have been suggested as alternatives. RFL chief executive Nigel Wood said: \"These two games have shown that the annual series between NRL and Super League clubs can be competitive. \"We are already in detailed discussion with our colleagues from the NRL about the format and potential locations for the 2018 World Club Series, and these discussions will advance over the coming weeks as we review the 2017 series. \"What is clear is that competitive international club rugby can showcase the very best in our sport to the world.\"",

        "article": "With cross-Channel disruption set to continue through the summer as French ferry workers strike, calls are mounting for solutions to be found to the traffic gridlock that hits Kent as a result - but how do you solve a problem like Operation Stack? Operation Stack is the name given to a queuing system where lorries waiting to cross the Channel park on closed sections of the M20. Last week, it reached unprecedented levels when Stack was extended to phase four for the first time in its history - residents nearby reported \"absolute bedlam\". Queues of 4,600 lorries stretched back 30 miles, the daily cost to the UK economy was estimated at \u00c2\u00a3250m, and emergency teams handed out more than 18,000 bottles of water to truckers stranded during a heatwave. It followed strike action in France by MyFerryLink workers who closed the Port of Calais. And Stack was again brought in days later after about 150 migrants tried to storm the Channel Tunnel in a bid to board UK-bound freight trains. But problems are not only caused by strikes and migrants - Stack is also a regular occurrence during winter months when storms and high winds hit the Channel and disrupt sailings. For years, there have been calls to find an alternative solution, amid complaints about the impact of traffic disruption on Kent's businesses and residents - from commuters and traders to parents on the school run. So how do you solve a problem like Operation Stack? Firstly, not everyone believes Stack is a problem. Pat Fleming, from Galway City, west Ireland, a driver who waited for 26 hours to cross the Channel, said it was part of his job and just \"one of those things\". He said Operation Stack worked as long as it was properly policed and added: \"It's not a big issue. It doesn't happen that often. The last time was during bad weather in February.\" Alan Overton, from Grimsby, who waited on the M20 for 33 hours to cross to France said he believed there was no way of preventing Stack, unless operations were completely moved from Dover to a \"super ferry port\" that could hold 6,000 vehicles and was built away from towns. Both drivers agreed facilities provided during Stack could be better. Out of the two, only Mr Overton ran out of supplies and needed the fruit and water handed out by emergency teams - but both drivers said the toilet facilities - portaloos put up at intervals along the closed motorway - were \"absolutely disgusting\". Matt Clarke, manager at Castledene Transport which has a fleet of lorries in Aylesford, said his fleet was left unable to access the M20, and the firm needed to use the motorway 24 hours a day. He said the media focus on the Calais strikes meant no-one noticed Kent was \"shut for days\". Stack hit the headlines last week because of the French strikes and migrant activity, but Kent dealt with the problem more often than anyone thought, he added. Calling for a lorry park to \"take the sting out of Stack\", he asked asked how hard it was to \"build a field and put some concrete on it\". Suggestions on how to cope with cross-Channel disruption have come from hauliers, ferry operators, politicians and residents. Ferry operator P&O called on the British and French authorities to keep Calais open. And in the case of the migrants, the UK and France agreed to increase funds to improve security at the port and tunnel. The UK's Road Haulage Association called for the military to be deployed to break up the French strike. Chief executive Richard Burnett said the \"time for talking\" had passed. And Dan Cook, operations director of Europa Worldwide Group, a transport, distribution and logistics firm, said the fundamental problem was there was no sign of active policing in Calais. Dover MP Charlie Elphicke said the problems underlined the need to consider expanding the port at Dunkirk, 45 miles from Calais. Meanwhile, Kent residents in Hollingbourne village, close by the M20, said people should have the right to sue French strikers in European courts for delays, inconveniences and wasted goods. Resident Chris Childs reported seeing 40 lorries drive through the village in 15 minutes to avoid the queues. He also said the journey time from Tonbridge to Hollingbourne - normally a 35-minute drive of 22 miles - increased to nearly two hours. Helen Whately, MP for Faversham and mid-Kent, described the impact on her constituents as \"incredibly inconvenient\". She said: \"People taking their children to school have long delays, and people getting to work - commuters - it's a nightmare. And it really seriously affects businesses.\" Calling for alternatives to Stack, she added: \"We know there are going to be more strikes likely during the summer and ongoing.\" She said short-term solutions needed to include better communications about delays to haulage companies so drivers could potentially postpone their journeys, and she said pressure must be placed on the French government to ensure as many routes as possible were kept running. But she also backed plans for lorry parks to be provided. Plans have already been put forward for a 3,300-space lorry park - although the size of the scheme has been criticised with calls for a smaller facility that would take up to a thousand vehicles. A report by Kent County Council in conjunction with Kent Police and Highways England is to be published soon, she said. The Port of Dover has said last week's events will have shattered any illusion their operation is a quaint little port doing ferry trips for holidaymakers and booze cruisers. But the port has also warned a very busy summer is rapidly approaching - and ferry companies have highlighted their concerns that routes stay open as the holiday season gets under way.",

Austin Haughwout claims he was kicked out of Central Connecticut state university over the footage. The institution says he was expelled over threats to shoot people there. Mr Haughwout argued he was only joking. Last month, Mr Haughwout and his father were ordered to give information about the drones videos to the authorities. Two separate videos showed drones rigged up to carry to the weapons hovering low in woodland in Connecticut, in the north-east United States. The first, posted in July 2015, showed a handgun firing rounds of ammunition. The second, which appeared in December that year, featured a flamethrower attached to a drone burning a turkey on a spit. The Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) opened an investigation into whether or not Mr Haughwout had broken any laws, though local police said they did not believe he had. Ruling last month, a judge said that he and his father, Bret, must hand documents over to the FAA, relating to the purchase of the gun, the drone and any money made from having posted the videos on YouTube, among other information. Mr Haughwout, 19, blamed his expulsion on the notoriety that followed the posting of the drone videos and is taking legal action in the New Britain superior court in a bid to be allowed to return, AP reports. It says Central Connecticut state officials denied that claim and instead pointed to the alleged threats. But a lawyer for Mr Haughwout said that what some may have interpreted as threats, were actually jokes, which are protected by the right to free speech. Mr Haughwout has also been in the news over two other incidents. In June this year, local police said they had charged him with enticing a minor with a computer, attempted sexual assault and possession of images of child abuse after officers said they had found images of child abuse on his mobile phone, AP reports. It says Mr Haughwout's lawyer reportedly called that arrest warrant \"overly broad\" and suggested that Clinton police had it in for his client because of the drone videos. Last year, Mr Haughwout was also charged with assaulting police officers. That case continues. And, in 2014, before the posting of the weaponised drone videos, a woman was charged with assaulting Mr Haughwout because she was upset that he had been using a drone to record video above a beach. Mr Haughwout posted footage of that confrontation on YouTube.",

Bristow asked on Twitter why victims did not \"sort out\" their abusers \"when they got older and fitter\". More than 20 ex-footballers have made allegations of child sex abuse. \"He was a contributor to our darts coverage in the past but we will not be using him in the future,\" said a Sky spokesman.

Several former footballers have waived their right to anonymity in order to go public and raise awareness of alleged historical abuse in football, a step which has won praise from politicians, sport administrators and abuse charities. At least eight police forces are now investigating allegations of historical sexual abuse. Bristow, who was made an MBE in 1989, suggested that darts players were \"tough guys\" and footballers \"wimps\". He added the victims should not be able to look themselves in the mirror for not \"getting their own back\" on their abusers in adulthood. In addition to his comments on sex abuse victims, Bristow caused anger by conflating paedophiles with homosexuals in a tweet that read: \"Might be a loony but if some football coach was touching me when I was a kid, as I got older I would have went back and sorted that poof out.\" Bristow has since deleted each of those tweets. Duncan Craig, chief executive of the charity Survivors Manchester, said he has reported Bristow's tweets to Staffordshire Police as a \"hate crime\". The charity, which supports male victims of sex crimes, now has Walters as an ambassador. Craig said of Bristow: \"His comments are absolutely appalling. \"Bristow is ill-educated but that's not a crime. However, calling someone derogatory homosexual terms is a hate crime in my view. \"The reason many men don't speak out is because they feel less of man, feel judged, feel ashamed. Bristow is perpetuating those myths to his 93,000 followers - that's why I'm taking such a strong stance.\"",

Pontio at Bangor University was due to open in September and is largely being paid for with public funds. The worker claims building mistakes and extensive water damage are responsible for delays and pushing it over budget. Construction firm Galliford Try said challenges were not out of the ordinary and were being met to deliver a \"high quality\" building. The Pontio arts and innovation centre is due to include a theatre, cinema and innovation and creative hub linked to the university. Photos obtained from inside the building in Bangor reveal some of the problems. Newly-laid floors have been dug up and recently finished walls and ceilings hacked apart because of extensive water damage. Staircases, basement rooms and the arts centre's new cinema have all suffered damage. The worker told BBC Wales: \"You get sent to do something in the morning, and then halfway through the day you get pulled away to do something else. \"So, boards and ceilings are going up without asking the electricians or the plumbers if they've finished in the roof. They then have to cut out holes to bring their cables through.\" INSIDE PONTIO The worker also said tiles were expanding when water got into them and have been replaced several times due to the damage. \"It's just - it's a mess, to be honest.\" He described the hurry to try to complete the building last September: \"It was such a rush that the rest of the building was abandoned. I think the rush was so big, a lot of mistakes were done.\" The worker added: \"They might open in June. But you'll have some painters who'll still be there at least until September.\" A spokesman for Middlesex-based Galliford Try said as with any project of the level of complexity that the Pontio building represents the construction team has faced \"a number of challenges throughout the build programme\". He added: \"None of these issues has been out of the ordinary experience of a construction process and all of these challenges are being met, ensuring that the high quality finish of the final building is not compromised. \"We remain committed to working collaboratively with the University of Bangor and all the stakeholders involved to reach a successful conclusion to this prestigious project as soon as is practically possible.\" Bangor University said it is working with Galliford Try in order that they may complete the building \"to a high standard of quality as quickly as possible\". A spokesman added: \"Galliford Try have assured us that they will complete the building to a high standard of finish and we look forward to seeing the building open.\" The Arts Council for Wales is currently withholding the final \u00a31m of capital funds it has promised the project and has not given any capital funding since last July. A spokesman said: \"Although we are a minor contributor to the overall project costs, we have been very concerned about the well-publicised delays to this important project. \"We have urged Bangor University to work closely with the project contractors to bring outstanding matters to a speedy conclusion. The remaining funds that we have allocated to the project have been held back until that happens.\" The Welsh government said: \"We are keen that the current delays should not affect the longer term benefit of the project for the people of north Wales and will continue to support Bangor University so that the project can be completed as soon as possible.\"",

The ex-Cabinet Minister lost his Yeovil seat in May's general election after 14 years as the constituency member. Mr Laws, 49, will serve as executive chairman of Centre Forum but is still considering various job opportunities two months on from his defeat. He described himself as not suited to \"navel gazing and endless holidays\". In his first full interview since the election, the former Minster for the Cabinet Office, Minister for Schools and Chief Secretary to the Treasury described his dismay at the \"tsunami sweeping away lots of Lib Dem MPs\" on 8 May. \"I was extremely disappointed and upset for people like my staff who've worked in my office for years and years. I was very sorry on their behalf,\" he said. \"I suppose it [the scale of the defeat] meant that it didn't feel quite as personal\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 when you see all of your colleagues being knocked over like ninepins then it feels something that it's much more difficult to do anything about.\" But the disappointment was clear to see as the former investment banker shunned the media scrum and left the count with barely a word to reporters. Having been integral to the negotiations that led to the formation of the coalition government in 2010, he had been \"hoping and expecting\" to do the same again. Instead, he went home to sleep. His new job for Centre Forum, a liberal policy think-tank, will take up two days a week but he hopes to have a full-time plan by the end of the summer. \"I've already got one role as chairman which I'm very pleased about as it will allow me to take forward my interest in education and education policy, and I've been talking to other people about other work I may do next,\" he said. But that plan will not include standing for election again. \"I'd already got the view that serving four terms in parliament, had I been re-elected in May this year, would have been about the right amount of time to do,\" he said. \"I don't think that MPs should go on forever and I think it's not therefore likely that I would stand again as a member of parliament.\" Despite the loss of the Yeovil seat to the Conservatives, he remains optimistic of the seat being recaptured by his party. \"In areas like Yeovil where we have had big and strong base at the local government level and a national presence for many years I would think that there's every chance we can win back the Yeovil constituency at the next general election in 2020 and I'll do everything I can to support our new candidate to become the next MP.\"",

The UK government said it will trigger the Article 50 process on March 29. Mrs May, visiting Swansea, promised to seek the \"best possible deal\" that would work for everyone across the UK. Mr Jones told The Guardian the prime minister had a \"tin ear\" on matters of devolution. He warned the future of the UK could be under threat if the UK government did not listen to the other administrations. \"If they are not careful, people's sense of disengagement with Brussels will simply attach itself to London,\" he said. \"They are giving the impression sometimes that they do not listen. \"And what kind of message is that to the people of Wales?\" Amid calls in Scotland for a second referendum on independence, the first minister said Wales needed to see a \"dividend\" for his government's continued support of a United Kingdom. \"Otherwise people in Wales are going to start saying, well, the government is listening to the Scots, we need to be like them,\" he said. \"And that's a dangerous path for the UK.\" Last week, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced her intention to seek approval for a second independence referendum, to be held between Autumn 2018 and Spring 2019.

Mrs May said she wanted to get \"the best possible deal for the United Kingdom that works for everyone across the United Kingdom\". She said the objectives included a \"good free trade deal\" and co-operation on matters such as security. Later in the afternoon, Mr Jones warned the assembly's constitutional and legislative affairs committee there could be Supreme Court challenges if the UK government took back powers from Europe and then decided which were to be devolved. \"I think that's wrong,\" he said. \"That's not the way we read our devolution settlement.

Bendtner required oxygen as he was carried off the field on a stretcher, having landed awkwardly in a collision with Blues defender Michael Morrison. The Dane had set up Eric Lichaj to open the scoring and Apostolos Vellios made it 2-0 from Henri Lansbury's cross. Lukas Jutkiewicz headed a goal back for Blues but Hildeberto Pereira finished Ben Osborn's low pass to seal victory. A Birmingham win could have taken Gary Rowett's side as high as second in the table, but their first away loss of the league campaign means they may be outside the top six by the time they host Rotherham on Tuesday. Lichaj's powerful angled shot, the defender's first goal for almost a year, lit up a flat first half at the City Ground. The only other talking point before the interval was Lansbury's disallowed free-kick, with referee Jeremy Simpson initially awarding a goal and then reversing his decision following consultation with his assistant. Forest's win came hours after owner Fawaz Al Hasawi announced he is close to agreeing a deal to sell the club. Al Hasawi, who took control of Forest in 2012, would not reveal the identity of the buyers but BBC Sport understands that a United States consortium, led by millionaire John Jay Moores, is on the verge of securing a \u00a350m deal. Head coach Philippe Montanier told BBC Radio Nottingham: \"I enjoyed the victory. We've worked hard during the international break and we applied what we worked on during that period. \"Bendtner's injury is a bad point of this evening. We don't know how serious it is. I hope it is not very serious. \"When you go off on a stretcher, you always worry. We hope to have more news on Saturday.\" Birmingham manager Gary Rowett told BBC WM: \"We weren't anywhere near the standards we've set so far this season, certainly in the first half. We were a little bit too predictable. \"We wanted to do much better in the second half and there was a real determination to do that.

        "article": "Former BHS owner Sir Philip Green will meet the pensions regulator by the end of the week to try to secure a deal over the collapsed retailer's pension fund, the BBC has learned. The news comes as MPs prepare to debate stripping him of his knighthood. One MP voiced scepticism to the BBC about the timing, arguing it made the issue \"essentially cash for honours\". BHS, sold by Sir Philip last year, subsequently collapsed with 11,000 jobs lost and a \u00a3571m pension deficit. Sir Philip has vowed several times to sort out the pension problem, telling MPs in June that his advisers were working on a \"resolvable and sortable\" solution. On Monday, he told ITV that he was in a \"very strong dialogue\" with the pensions regulator to find a solution, but would not put a number on the level of financial support he would be willing to give. A damning MPs' report on the High Street chain's failure, published in July, concluded Sir Philip had extracted large sums and left the business on \"life support\". At the time Sir Philip described the report as \"the pre-determined and inaccurate output of a biased and unfair process\". A debate in the House of Commons on Thursday will discuss whether Sir Philip's knighthood, awarded in 2006 for services to retail, should be removed. Should they vote on the issue, any such vote would not be binding. The issue would be for the Honours Forfeiture Committee - part of the Cabinet Office - to decide. Sir Philip's knighthood hinges on whether he makes good on a promise to secure the future of 20,000 BHS pension scheme members. As things stand, many of them face a cut in their pension benefits if the scheme ends up in the industry backed pension protection fund. Despite repeated assurances, so far he has tabled no firm offer. But, the BBC has leaned that a meeting with the pensions regulator to work through obstacles to a final deal is scheduled before the end of the week. The decision on whether to have a vote on Thursday on his knighthood rests with the speaker of the House of Commons. It falls to him to decide whether it is worth waiting to see if Sir Philip can produce a deal before MPs vote on whether to start the process of removing his title. MPs contacted by the BBC have expressed scepticism about this latest offer - one described it as essentially \"cash for honours\". BHS pension scheme members will care more about their retirement income than this game of parliamentary poker. Read more from Simon",

Media playback is not supported on this device The Real Madrid forward picked up his second yellow card of the campaign during Friday's 0-0 draw with the Republic of Ireland in Dublin. Bale will miss one game through suspension, the visit to Group D leaders Serbia on June 11. \"It's up to us to fill that gap, go there and get a result,\" Gunter said. Neil Taylor will also be absent in Belgrade, the Aston Villa defender facing a potential three-match ban for the challenge which saw Republic captain Seamus Coleman require surgery on his shattered right leg. Reading defender Gunter, who became Wales' joint-third most capped player on Friday, says Wales have shown they can win without key players, even Bale, the world's second most expensive player. \"We've missed important players in the past and we've always said it's not a one-man team,\" Gunter said. \"For Gaz to play well, he needs the team. That won't change in the summer. \"You'd rather him in your team, but he's not there and we've got to get a result. \"We're more than capable with the squad we have to go and do that, with or without any of our players. \"We will deal with it and move on.\" Bale, who has scored four goals in this campaign, has not missed a competitive international since October 2013 - having featured in 21 successive competitive matches. His absence comes at a difficult time for third-placed Wales who are four points adrift of Serbia and the Republic of Ireland at the halfway stage, having drawn four of their five matches in Group D. But Gunter said: \"We've still got enough games to put a run of wins together and you can't predict how other results will go. \"We'd like to have picked up a couple more points, but it's never easy to qualify. \"We're still unbeaten and we're not far away from turning these draws into victories. \"Even though it could be better, we're not in the worst position we've ever been in. \"We've shown in the past that we can go anywhere and put wins together.

Ireland did what they needed to do.\" The Wales manager continued his defence of Villa defender Taylor. \"He's numb,\" he said. \"He hasn't said a word.

        "article": "Jeremy Corbyn has pledged to extend public ownership of the country's bus networks if he becomes prime minister. The Labour leader, who is battling against challenger Owen Smith to retain his job, has said he will \"rebuild and transform Britain's transport system\". He pledged to offer councils new franchising powers and allow them to set up local bus companies. He also set out plans to bring railways back into public ownership to fix the present \"transport nightmare\". Mr Smith's campaign said all of Mr Corbyn's proposals were already Labour policy. The Labour leader promised to expand bus services to areas not currently covered, to give councils franchising powers over their bus networks, and to allow them to set up \"municipal bus companies\". Mr Corbyn claims the moves would save money that could be used to reverse government cuts to local bus services. Franchising powers are already to be expanded by the government's Bus Services Bill, focusing on areas with an elected mayor in place. However, the bill, which focuses on services in England outside London, rules out allowing local authorities to set up bus companies. The government says it will increase passenger numbers and \"enable a thriving and innovative commercial bus sector\". Mr Corbyn also highlighted his flagship pledge to renationalise the railways - a pledge matched by Mr Smith. Speaking at a protest about rail fares in London, Mr Corbyn pointed to the \"pretty terrible service\" run by Southern Rail in the South East of England, where passengers have held protests about train cancellations and timetable changes. He said \"pretty much everyone\" agreed the Southern network should be publicly-run, adding that the current model was \"not a sensible way of running a public railway system that we have all paid for\". Mr Smith's spokesman said his candidate would \"go further\" to improve transport with a \u00c2\u00a3200bn infrastructure fund. He added: \"There is nothing new in what Jeremy is saying - he is simply rehashing existing Labour Party policy.\" The winner of Labour's leadership contest will be announced on 24 September. Mr Corbyn has won the backing of a majority of local constituency Labour parties (CLP) in his re-election bid, securing 285 CLP nominations to Mr Smith's 53, although the scorecard has no direct bearing on the result. The leadership vote comes after Labour MPs signed a vote of no confidence in Mr Corbyn, who won an overwhelming victory among members in last summer's leadership contest. Mr Corbyn said he was \"looking forward to a good result\" in the contest, adding that if he won he would appoint a shadow team \"that represents all of the party\". Mr Smith, who has warned the \"legacy of successive Labour governments\" could be wiped out if the party continues along its current path, focused his campaign on the NHS on Monday. He accused the government of having \"a secret plan to privatise the NHS\" in England - a view rejected by the Department of Health.

        "article": "The relationship between black Americans and the police is once again in the spotlight. This time, Charlotte in North Carolina is a focal point of unrest, after a black man was killed by officers this week. There have also been peaceful protests in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where a police officer has been charged with manslaughter. This is a recurring cycle of violence in the US. According to one research group, over 100 unarmed black people were killed by the police in 2015 and a string riots have occurred following similar shootings in 2016. But what can be done to resolve this? Five US experts share their thoughts on rebuilding trust between black American communities and the police. Like any social problem, the first step is to simply acknowledge that a policing problem exists. I think one of the difficulties Americans are facing right now is that there is some disagreement as to whether there is a problem at all. One practical thing that needs to be done immediately is to push towards more community policing. It really changes the dynamic, the cultural dynamic, because officers are members of the communities they operate in. If a citizen shops at the same grocery store as his local police officer, they will recognise each other as human. I think a lot of the problems we see have to do with geography. You have to put people in the same geographical spaces, to occupy the same spaces. When you do, people see each other and interact with each other, not necessarily in the structured work environment, but in the unstructured social environment. That's why I think community policing works. Christopher Bracey is an expert on US race relations, individual rights and criminal procedure. He is professor of law at Georgetown University in Washington DC. There's always a tendency to say let's train the police and they're not going to be prejudiced and the problem will go away. Well, no. That's obviously important and needs to be done. But clearly, as we've seen in some of the shootings, even the officers have been black. I think the patterns of tension we are seeing now are rooted in long-term inequality and disadvantage. Violence has, for a long time, been concentrated in poor communities, especially segregated communities and minority communities that have been subject to disinvestment on the part of the state. So in some sense, when you look at it scientifically, it's not really a surprise when you see occurrences of conflict between these people and the police. Criminal justice, housing and education reform really need to be coupled to address this issue. That is the message I see from the data. Robert J Sampson is director of the Boston Area Research Initiative and professor of social sciences at Harvard University. Source: Mapping Police Violence/NPR Courts routinely award damages totalling hundreds of millions of dollars to citizens who have suffered injuries or rights violations from the police. Taxpayers pay most of those costs. But as the bills pile up, there is no sign that police acknowledge, analyse or learned from their costly mistakes. In other public service domains - transportation, medicine, child welfare - there are routines for studying what went wrong: warning signs that were missed, lapses in communication, procedures that can be reshaped to prevent future failure. Why not in law enforcement?  Why is there not a collaborative social autopsy of these cases? Decades of lower crime rates and the racial breach in public confidence in the police present new opportunities to fundamentally rethink the policing model and the profession. Jeffrey Fagan is an expert in police accountability and a Professor of Law at Columbia University in New York City. It will take a range of solutions to really address this issue. Policy is a huge part of it and will have a huge impact on police violence. But ultimately it will also take cultural change to address some of the beliefs and prejudices that allow these deaths to happen and allow the system to not do anything about it. We need to shift the perception in America that black people are inherently criminal or that black people are inherently deserving of a punitive approach by the state. We also need to have a broader conversation about what is reasonable force [when making arrests]. You know, in England, you have instances of people armed with knives, or in some cases armed with guns, who are not being killed by police. The police are de-escalating these situations without resulting in deadly force. That seems to be the expectation. That expectation is currently not the norm in the United States. It seems to be the norm of the culture here that if someone has a knife, a gun or even a toy gun that it is totally legitimate to kill them. I think that is something that needs to change. Sam Sinyangwe is a data scientist and activist who founded Mapping Police Violence, which compiles records of police shootings in the United States. I think the most important thing we need to do, honestly, is to fundamentally reconceptualise what we think the job [of an officer] is about. For the last three decades, we have thought about the police as an institution focused on public safety and crime reduction. But that's not all they do. They do a lot of things that are nothing to do with that actually that involve helping citizens and engaging in positive ways, We need agencies to focus on these things. If the police are still understanding their primary role as crime reduction, then we are not going to solve this problem. Tracey Meares served on President Obama's 2014 Policing Task Force.

The jihadists seized buildings on the eastern edge of the adjacent city of Tadmur on Thursday, but their push was reportedly halted by the Syrian army. Syria's antiquities chief warned that if IS seizes the Unesco World Heritage site it will destroy everything there. The group has ransacked and demolished several ancient sites in Iraq. Palmyra has already suffered some damage during the four-year civil war. It is situated in a strategically important area on the road between the capital, Damascus and the contested eastern city of Deir al-Zour, and close to gas fields On Thursday, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that IS militants were mounting an assault on Tadmur, the modern town next to the ruins of Palmyra. Twenty-six civilians in a village outside Tadmur were summarily killed by IS - at least 10 by beheading - on Thursday after being accused of collaborating with President Bashar al-Assad's government, Mr Abdul Rahman said. IS itself claimed on Twitter that it had taken control of northern and eastern parts of Tadmur, and that it had shot down a Syrian air force MiG jet in the area. Homs provincial governor Talal Barazi confirmed that al-Sukhanah, a town to the north-east, had fallen on Wednesday and said 1,800 families from the town were sheltering in Tadmur. The Syrian Observatory said more than 70 soldiers and 40 militants had been killed in the battle for al-Sukhanah. Rising out of the desert and flanked by an oasis, Palmyra contains the monumental ruins of a great city that was one of the most important cultural centres of the ancient world, according to Unesco. The site, most of which dates back to the 1st to the 2nd Century when the region was under Roman rule, is dominated by a grand, colonnaded street. At the southern end of the 1.1km street is the great temple of Bel, considered one of the most important religious buildings of the 1st Century in the East and of unique design. Syria's director of antiquities, Maamoun Abdul Karim, said that if Palmyra were to fall to IS, it would be an \"international catastrophe\". \"It will be a repetition of the barbarism and savagery which we saw in Nimrud, Hatra and Mosul,\"  he told AFP news agency. The ancient sites in northern Iraq were recently blown up by IS militants, who control swathes of territory on both sides of the Syria-Iraq border. A US-led coalition has carried out air strikes on the jihadist group's positions since September. However, it says it does not co-ordinate its actions with the Assad government.",

With more than half the votes counted, President Juan Manuel Santos is leading his conservative rival Oscar Ivan Zaluaga with slightly more than 50%. The campaign has been dominated by discussions on the ongoing peace talks with the leftist Farc rebel group. Mr Santos, who launched negotiations in November 2012, lost the first round last month by a narrow margin. Mr Zuluaga says he will impose tougher conditions in order to carry on with the talks. More than 32 million Colombians were eligible to vote, but the turnout was low in the first round at just over 40%. Mr Zuluaga, 55, is a former finance minister. He received 29% of the vote in the first round, compared to 26% for Mr Santos. Their main disagreement between the two candidates seems to be on how to end a five-decade long conflict with the country's main rebel group, the Farc. Mr Zuluaga initially said he would pull out of the talks and boost military attacks on the weakened rebel group. That is the line adopted by his mentor, former president Alvaro Uribe, who was elected senator this year and is still one of the most influential figures in Colombian politics. Later in the campaign he said he would continue to negotiate with the Farc provided the rebels renounced military action during the talks. Mr Santos, 62, is aiming to conclude negotiations by the end of the year. Government negotiators and rebel leaders have held several rounds of talks in the Cuban capital, Havana. They have agreed on three points of the agenda drawn up in 2012:  land reform, future political participation and drug trafficking, which is allegedly the main source of income for the rebels. Three other points remain to be agreed on: the rights of the victims, disarmament of the rebels and the implementation of the agreement. On the eve of the vote, Colombia stopped to watch the national team in its opening match in the football World Cup. Both candidates were quick to congratulate the team on its 3-0 victory over Greece in the Brazilian city of Belo Horizonte. \"This win for Colombia has moved us; and tomorrow [Sunday], we need to wrap things up by winning the presidency,\" said Mr Zuluaga. \"Let's go, Colombia. We started things off at the World Cup on the right foot. And tomorrow [Sunday] peace is going to be the winner,\" said Mr Santos. Polls opened at 08:00 local time (13:00 GMT) and closed at 16:00. Results are expected shortly after polls close, as ballots are electronic.",

        "article": "In September 2012, 18-year-old Doga Makiura made his first trip to Rwanda, a country which many Japanese would only associate with the genocide in 1994. His aim was to give children in rural areas an access to education. As a member of non-profit organisation e-Education Project, he travelled across the country for the next year. \"I filmed some of the best teachers' classes in big cities, burned them onto DVDs and showed them to students in rural areas,\" he says. He chose DVDs because internet connection was hard to come by. In the first year, Doga visited more than 700 students in five schools. The examination results at those schools improved by 46%. \"In developed countries, kids complain about having to do homework, but these Rwandan children were thrilled to be able to learn, which made me happy.\" During one of his trips, he noticed piles of food that were in storage. Farmers were too poor to transport them to big cities. Through United Nations workers whom he met in Rwanda, Mr Makiura decided to facilitate the transport of food between the farmers and hundreds of thousands of refugees who were fleeing the civil war in neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo. That was less than two years ago. Today, he is based in Bangkok where he has started his own company. His passion remains the same: to raise the living standards of people in developing countries. This time he's doing it through a mobile phone application called Personal Data Bank. The app is still in the early-development stage, but the aim is to build a more efficient infrastructure by analysing the locations of people who are using the app. Mr Makiura is an atypical Japanese youth. Above all, he is not afraid to take risks. And his global vision and entrepreneurial spirit are exactly what the Japanese government wants to encourage. Today, Japan has one of the lowest levels of entrepreneurship in the developed world, according to the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor. There are a number of obstacles. Japan has long lacked venture capitalists who tend to invest in start-ups elsewhere in the world. And approaching banks for financing help, is a big challenge for entrepreneurs. \"I asked for funding through traditional financial institutions but they wanted to see balance sheets which we don't have,\" says Naoki Mita, who left his banking job to open detox spa Le Furo. Mr Mita approached Mr Makiura and asked for him to be an adviser to the spa venture. And together, they managed to secure funding from investors abroad. But Mr Mita believes not many entrepreneurs would even consider raising money overseas. \"Thanks to my experience as an investment banker I could look outside Japan, but at home the gap between demand and supply in the capital market is severe,\" he says. But the fundamental problem lies deeper in people's perspectives. In a society that appreciates a conformist attitude, not following the usual path of becoming a salaryman - a company employee -  is seen as too risky or even reckless. The former boss of the once high-flying internet firm, Livedoor, Takafumi Horie challenged that view in the 1990s. Instead of graduating from elite Tokyo University and looking for a job, he dropped out and started his own firm. \"I couldn't care less about what people thought of me,\" he tells the BBC. \"I had no desire to become a salaryman or wear a suit,\" adds Mr Horie, who stood out in the conservative world of corporate Japan by wearing T-shirts to business meetings. Under his leadership, Livedoor grew rapidly. He also made headlines by trying to buy a baseball team and running in a parliamentary election. But in 2006, Mr Horie was charged with securities fraud and imprisoned for 21 months before he was released on parole. He has maintained his innocence and accused the prosecution of targeting him for his brash, unconventional entrepreneurship. His arrest became known as the \"Horie shock\" and regardless of their beliefs about his guilt, other entrepreneurs from then on kept a low profile. The support for start-ups that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has announced is a turning point in people's perspectives. Today, there are more venture capital companies to help start-ups. The number of entrepreneurs is on the rise. \"What's lacking now is the true venture capitalist spirit - not just injecting capital but mentoring and helping the next generation grow,\" says special advisor to the Cabinet Office William Saito, adding that the government is trying to encourage that. But Mr Makiura says many of his peers are still trying to get a job with big listed companies. He says he is who he is today because when he was just 13, he decided to leave the comfort of home to study in the UK. He wanted to see the world outside Japan. Mr Horie says the whole education system needs to change, because at the moment, it is only producing loyal soldiers who are good at following orders. Half a century ago, Japan did produce a number of great entrepreneurs. They were the founders of Toyota, Sony and Honda who were unafraid to try something different. But as the economy grew, Mr Saito says, the Japanese society became unforgiving towards failures, and this needs to change. People like Mr Makiura are still too rare. But Japanese youths who are unafraid to take risks may be the best way to jump start the Japanese economy.",

        "article": "Egypt's internet activists have played a key role in the pro-democracy protests from the outset, but they tell the BBC that the online campaigning is evolving to suit their real-life activism in Tahrir Square. This revolution is the result of someone sending a Facebook invitation to many people.  I got it like other people on our network.  The buzz around it was then created on different social media websites and with videos.  I was here on 25 January when riot police forced us out and by the 28th, we were back following the violence.  I've been sleeping here most of the time since. Our social network was established in 2005, when there was a democratic opening around the time of the presidential elections. People from different backgrounds all met through blogging and hoped to use technology for social change.  It meant we have all gained good contacts, experience and strong networks. I like to think the social network is the people itself.  Things like Facebook, Twitter, SMS and phones are just social tools.  When they blocked Facebook and shut down technology, our network still operated because it's about people.  Internet activists are also people and a lot of our organising, social work and relationships are developed offline. This is something that people dreamt of but didn't anticipate happening in reality.  If anything, it shows that all the effort we put in over the past few years has not been wasted.  It has climaxed into this critical mass of people you see in the square. At the moment I'm not getting a lot of internet connection.  I'm trying not to drain my phone battery. We're still using it to distribute footage people are bringing to us that we've sorted through. I hope the internet will continue to play a complementary role in activism.  At the moment we physically exist in downtown Cairo and I hope that when we have finished this sit-in, we will have won the right to organise ourselves outside the internet. Twitter: Amr Gharbeia I was involved in this revolution from the first day, 25 January, and I've now been spending my nights here for a while. For the past five years, I was very active online, blogging and tweeting.  As we live under emergency laws in Egypt it has been very difficult to meet or communicate except on the internet. I'd never been part of a demonstration on the ground. At first we were mocking the event on 25 January.  We questioned whether it was really possible to have a \"Facebook revolution\". I came on the 25th because I felt it was my duty as a citizen and I couldn't believe how it turned into something so different from what we've seen before.  I was walking among the people and weeping. Now I sometimes just tweet to update people about what's going on or to call for a million-man demonstration or a day to remember our martyrs.  I'm well-known among bloggers for my long articles and constant tweets, but once I was here I stopped communicating this way so much. I felt it was totally different to have real freedom rather than just hypothetical freedom or internet freedom. Blogging and tweeting has been important as we were building our minds.  This regime stopped us from doing that.  We had have poor education and no national cultural programmes.  I am so proud now, especially when I think of our young martyrs.  In Egypt we have suffered a lot and it's about time that we start to live like real people. Twitter: Nawara Negm I'm not writing my blog right now.  We're just using Twitter as it's easy and flexible to do from your mobile.  If we have a lot of action here I might do as many as 20 or 30 tweets a day.  We also use Bambuser for live-streaming from our mobiles here in Tahrir Square. The internet gave us our backbone but it is not because of Facebook that this happened.  It was the force used by the police that brought everybody together.  If they had let us leave peacefully on 25 January, this would never have happened.  It got worse with the violence on 28th: The shootings, the tear gas, the killings, the brutality.  When they cut the internet and mobile phone lines this only increased people's anger. In the square we have organised our lives well. We have a co-ordinating committee telling us where there have been attacks and a group doing cleaning.  We have some people singing and some praying. We have Christians, Muslims, agnostics, leftists and rightists and we all live together well.   In our community we're trying to set an example of how we can all live together.  It's like a city inside the city here.  We are the kernel of the revolution. Blog: MaLek X (in Arabic) The revolution was publicised on the internet.  The spark was Facebook.  People were really sceptical about it because they didn't think you could have a revolution where you named the date, but now I look around me and I am really proud of the Egyptian people and the initiative.  I'm sure that those who named the date didn't think things would go this far. To begin with on 25 January, we had mostly young people of all classes who somehow use the internet.  You have internet cafes even in the poorest areas of Egypt so even less well-educated people have access, especially to Facebook.  A lot was also achieved through word of mouth - people telling their friends and neighbours.  The independent media took a middle-ground to begin with as everyone was watching their backs but now they have got onboard. After our huge turnout on the first Tuesday, demonstrations continued for the next two days and we publicised further action for Friday on the internet.  That day they cut our communications and took our cameras so we had an information blackout and the violence was unbelievable. A lot of people died. Still the threshold of fear and pain had been broken and we have kept up momentum since. Now older people especially come up to us when we're collecting trash or whatever in the square and they say: \"We're really proud of you... You did what we didn't manage to do for 60 years.\" People have called this the \"Facebook Revolution\" because it gave us a form of expression even when people were too scared to talk in big groups about political issues.  We had already set up Facebook pages for people who were tortured to death.  We found it was a way to talk without being tracked. In the square we have bridged a lot of gaps.  I've been living here since 29 January with tens of thousands of other people.  I put my head down to sleep and I don't know the people sleeping around me. I have wonderful conversations with people from all over Egypt who normally I would never have talked to. We're finally getting to know each other. It's wonderful.",

        "article": "French presidential candidate Francois Fillon has avoided an abrupt end to his campaign by securing the support of his divided Republican Party. For weeks he has come under pressure to step down as investigations continue into allegations that his wife was paid large sums of public money for a job she did not do. But having won a battle with his centre-right party, what now are Mr Fillon's chances in the fight for the Elysee Palace? He will have his work cut out if he is to claw back the lead he once held in France's presidential race. The latest opinion poll on Tuesday placed him third, on 19%, several points behind centrist Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen of the far-right National Front. Mr Fillon has stuck fast to his hard-core base for the past six weeks, as an investigation into his wife's employment whipped up a storm around his campaign. As centrist supporters deserted him in droves, he barely blinked. When his campaign manager and senior spokesman quit, Mr Fillon brushed it aside. When dozens of MPs deserted him, he retorted that he would do without them all. When polls suggested that he would struggle to reach the second round run-off, Mr Fillon ploughed on, determined to show that he retained the support of his most loyal followers. In that sense, his management of the scandal seems to have been a success. Tens of thousands of people turned out in the rain to rally around him on Sunday. But his handling of the allegations against him, and the media attention surrounding them, have also marked a sharp change in tone for France's most establishment presidential candidate, with new tactics borrowed from the populist playbook. Sunday's rally was initially described by Mr Fillon as a protest against political interference in the judiciary. He has complained of an \"institutional coup d'etat\", suggesting that the Socialist government is behind the allegations currently being investigated. At press conferences recently he has presented himself as the victim a \"political assassination\", of a \"lynching\" by the media, and he has accused investigators of leaking only one side of the evidence in his case. Mr Fillon has said he will leave it up to the voters to judge him, not a \"biased [judicial] process\". But attacking the nation's institutions while running for office has not gone down well with some party colleagues. Former Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin, on French radio, called it \"dangerous\" and \"irresponsible\". The man Mr Fillon beat to become Republican candidate, Alain Juppe, accused him of leading the campaign into an impasse. \"He had a wide open road before him,\" he said. \"What a waste.\" There was a sceptical response, too, to the claim by Mr Fillon's team that Sunday's rally had drawn 200,000 people to the Trocadero in Paris. Several journalists remarked that the plaza only held around 35,000 people when full. The claim of 200,000 is still prominently featured on Mr Fillon's campaign website. There is now talk of a \"Trumpisation\" of the centre-right candidate, with several commentators and news outlets comparing him to the US president. It is a very different side of a politician many saw as calm, unruffled and rather phlegmatic; \"impervious to demagoguery and exaggeration\", as Le Monde put it. But will the same tactics work to win back the broader votes he needs in the election itself? Mr Fillon might claim legitimacy from the people, but he is still a risk for his party. He is due to appear before a judge on 15 March and says he expects to be placed under formal investigation. Attacking the media, government and judiciary might work with his most loyal supporters, but it has driven many other voters away. If this is the new face of Francois Fillon, some might wonder what that says about the future of French politics itself.",

Gen Sir Nicholas Houghton told the BBC's Andrew Marr that refusing to launch nuclear weapons would \"seriously undermine\" Britain's \"deterrent\". And he said he would be worried if such a view \"translated into power\". Mr Corbyn called on the defence secretary to \"take action\" against Sir Nicholas over his comments. In a statement, the Labour leader said: \"It is a matter of serious concern that the chief of the defence staff has today intervened directly in issues of political dispute. \"It is essential in a democracy that the military remains politically neutral at all times. \"By publicly taking sides in current political arguments, Sir Nicholas Houghton has clearly breached that constitutional principle. Accordingly, I am writing to the defence secretary to ask him to take action to ensure that the neutrality of the armed forces is upheld.\" Mr Corbyn, a leading member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, sparked a row with his shadow cabinet at his party's annual conference when he revealed that would never press the \"nuclear button\" - and he has since praised Scottish Labour's rejection of Trident. Mr Corbyn has said he was elected Labour leader on a platform of opposing Trident renewal and that he is committed to \"promoting an international nuclear weapons convention which would lead to a nuclear-free world\". Asked about Mr Corbyn's refusal to use nuclear weapons, Sir Nicholas said: \"It would worry me if that thought was translated into power as it were.\" He added: \"The whole thing about deterrence rests on the credibility of its use. \"When people say you're never going to use the deterrent, what I say is you use the deterrent every second of every minute of every day and the purpose of the deterrent is that you don't have to use it because you successfully deter. \"If a prime minister said they would never press the nuclear button, \"the deterrent is then completely undermined,\" he added. \"Most of the politicians I know understand that and I think that, dare I say, the responsibility of power is probably quite a sobering thing and you come to a realisation, 'I understand how this thing works'.\" Attending a wreath-laying ceremony in his Islington North constituency following the Remembrance Sunday commemorations at the Cenotaph, Mr Corbyn said Sir Nicholas's comments had been \"unhelpful\". \"I would gently say to him, with the greatest of respect, we live in a democracy where politicians are elected to Parliament in order to take political decisions,\" he told Channel 4 News. \"If he's worried, I think he should talk to me about it. I don't think it is appropriate for serving officers to make political comments or engage in political debate.\" Shadow defence secretary Maria Eagle told Andrew Marr she was leading an \"open-minded\" review of the policy in light of Mr Corbyn's views and a vote by Scottish Labour against the renewal of Trident. She said she had yet to meet Mr Corbyn to discuss Trident but a date was in her diary. But she appeared to back Sir Nicholas, telling Andrew Marr: \"I understand the point that he is making. It is the point that I made myself when Jeremy said what he said.\" She defended the right of Britain's most senior military figure to speak out on such a politically sensitive issue. \"I don't think there is anything wrong with him expressing himself in those terms,\" she said. She indicated she could resign if there was any change to the party's current position in favour of renewing the Trident submarine fleet. \"I am not a unilateral nuclear disarmer. I don't believe that that works. \"I think I would find it difficult [to continue in the shadow cabinet] but we are not there yet. We have got a big process to go through,\" she said.",

The President argued that even if the accord was fully implemented it would only have a \"tiny, tiny\" impact. But researchers have told BBC News that the President was \"cherry picking in the extreme\" in his use of the facts. They say that the Paris deal could make the difference between tolerable and dangerous levels of warming. While much of his statement on withdrawal was concerned with the negative economic impact of being part of the Paris agreement, the President also mentioned the negligible impact that the deal would have on temperatures. \"It is estimated it would only produce a two-tenths of one degree \u2026 Celsius reduction in global temperature by the year 2100,\" he said during his lengthy explanation. \"Tiny, tiny amount.\" Climate researchers have immediately taken issue with the President's use of the data. \"This is cherry picking in the extreme,\" said Prof Niklas H\u00f6hne, who works with the Climate Action Tracker to monitor likely emissions levels. \"He picked the study that has the least impact of the Paris agreement on the global temperature increase.\" The study on which this assertion was based was carried out by scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2014 and published in 2015. Crucially the study didn't include all the commitments made by countries in the run up to the meeting in the French capital at the end of 2015 that agreed the wide-reaching Paris  deal. Another major question is that the study presumed that none of the actions proposed would continue past 2030. \"Their study assumes that countries implement their Paris pledges by 2030 but then move back to high emissions,\" said Prof H\u00f6hne. \"We think that is unrealistic because if the countries implement Paris they will likely continue with similar policies.\" A subsequent investigation in 2016 by the same group at MIT suggests that up to one degree of warming could be averted if all the promises made in the Paris agreement were honoured.  The authors believe that withdrawing from Paris is the wrong approach. Their findings on how much difference Paris will make are echoed by the Climate Action Tracker researchers who found that 0.8 of a degree of warming could be avoided if countries stuck to their pledges. This difference could help prevent dangerous levels of warming for the whole planet. \"It is a considerable impact, and it is the first time since 2009 we see a considerable downward trend in temperatures because countries have made proposals for what they are going to do,\" said Prof H\u00f6hne. \"This, for me, is a really strong point of the Paris agreement.\" How strongly the US pullout will impact future global temperatures is currently being assessed by scientists, including those at the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO). \"This is an additional 0.3 degrees on the warming, due to the withdrawal of the US,\" Deon Terblanche, the head of the WMO's Atmospheric Research and Environment Department, told a meeting in Geneva, stressing that this was an estimate and not a modelled result. \"That's a worst case scenario, and this is probably not what will happen.\" Prof Niklas H\u00f6hne agrees that the full impact of the US pullout could be less than feared. \"President Trump wants to stop the Clean Power Plan, but it is very likely that some of the states will go even further and be more aggressive and we also hear there is pushback from many major companies that they want to go towards more renewables. \"In essence progressive states and companies could compensate for Trump.\" Follow Matt on Twitter and on Facebook",

        "article": "Viewers have been guessing who did it for the last year, but on Thursday EastEnders will FINALLY reveal who killed Lucy Beale. It's part of the show's 30th anniversary week, so two good reasons for a party. Here are some tips on how to throw the perfect bash... It may be a poor substitute for Albert Square, but choose a character to dress up as and pop down the local market to pick your outfit. Will it be Whitney, will it be Max, will it be Ian? Whoever you pick, gold hoop earnings, plastic leather jackets, fake fur and tracksuits could be on the shopping list. You won't go far wrong with a chef's apron either. Fill your basket with cheap crisps, sweets and drinks. You may not be on first name terms with the cashier, or get into a row while you're in there, but if you try really hard you may just believe you're in the Minute Mart. For the main course, it's just got to be fish and chips. In honour of the Beale family, make it plaice. Make your guests really feel like they're stepping into Albert Square. A street sign on the front door, framed pictures of the cast around the room and the EastEnders theme tune on a loop would certainly help set the mood. If you really want to push the boat out, why not create your own Queen Vic, complete with a bar, a royal sculpture and a licence above the door? No Who Killed Lucy Beale party would be complete without some sort of competition to guess who the culprit actually is. Whoever gets the killer right, gets the prize. Yay! Sure, this may just be a bit of fun but at the heart of all this is the loss of a young woman's life (sort of). Yes, she had a history of causing trouble and getting up people's noses, but do take a minute to remember Lucy Beale. RIP Lucy, never forgotten. We are in no way condoning physical violence, but come on, no EastEnders event would be complete without a bit of a verbal bust up. After the big reveal, just let all that vent up frustration out of your system. Frowning all night and generally being a bit glum could also help you get in the mood. Have fun! In true EastEnders style, after the party, head to a trendy club around the corner. Ideally, you'll know practically everyone in there and the music will be so quiet you'll hear what the bloke at the end of the bar is saying. You'll probably get into a row with whoever's serving the drinks as well. Now you're really getting into the spirit of it. If you're nursing a sore head the next morning after all that \"loud music\", get down to your local greasy spoon for a fry up. And hopefully it will stop you feeling like this...

The Tigers, who have now won just once in six Championship matches, would have gone above Middlesbrough with victory. Forest sacked boss Dougie Freedman on Sunday after a run of five defeats in six, but Gary Gardner's 30-yard strike put them ahead at the break. Hull substitute Aluko rescued a draw, sliding the ball in after a deflection. The goal came with 17 minutes remaining and lifted a restless home crowd who had seen their side struggle to create chances against an impressive Forest defence. Although Abel Hernandez hit the post early on, Hull, who drop to fourth, were lifeless in attack and Gardner's sensational strike, after a neat passing move, increased the nerves. Reds substitute Oliver Burke, who replaced debutant Federico Macheda following his loan move from Cardiff, could have made it 2-0 after a swift counter-attack. But the hosts rallied, with Aluko making the most of a cruel deflection from Tom Huddlestone's shot to make it 1-1 and Mohamed Diame wasting a great chance for victory when he fired an effort just wide. Hull manager Steve Bruce: Media playback is not supported on this device \"It's really frustrating. We don't deserve to lose the game, that's for sure and they've scored a wonder goal and we've had enough chances to settle us down really. \"There's still 10 games to go or whatever it is.

Everybody's anxious, which is not a good thing. \"We need to go up to Middlesbrough and get a result and hopefully that can be the case - there is no reason why we can't - and come back for the last five games and produce the sort of performances which has got us in this position because the last two or three weeks has been very frustrating.\" Nottingham Forest manager Paul Williams: \"I don't think anyone gave us a chance tonight. Credit to the players that we took the game to Hull, especially early on. \"I asked every player to be themselves and be the best they could. Don't think it's about me and playing for me, just play for yourselves.\" \"My job is to prepare the team for a spicy local derby [against Derby County on Saturday] and that is what I will do. \"There are so many permutations, players who have played for both teams.

Media playback is not supported on this device The former England boss won just six of 28 Premier League games in charge of the Magpies, who are just one place off the foot of the table. McClaren and his team were booed off following Saturday's 3-1 loss to Bournemouth at St James' Park - their third successive league defeat. However, in a statement McClaren said: \"I remain confident that we would have stayed in the Premier League.\" He added: \"I am obviously disappointed with the decision. \"Whilst there has been a lot of intense speculation surrounding my position over recent days, my sole priority has been to maintain my professionalism and carry on with my work to best prepare the team. \"For every supporter of Newcastle, I genuinely hope the club can produce the results I believe they are capable of to maintain their Premier League status.\" McClaren's future has been a source of almost constant speculation since the defeat by the Cherries. Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker tweeted: \"Newcastle have finally put Steve McClaren out of his misery. \"The running of that great football club is beyond shambolic.\" Ian Dennis, BBC Radio 5 live's senior football reporter, said Benitez had been identified as a replacement for McClaren at a board meeting on Monday. Media playback is not supported on this device \"Rafa in the driving seat to replace McClaren,\" tweeted former Magpies striker Michael Owen. \"Whoever takes over, I still expect Newcastle to stay up.\" McClaren, 54, signed a three-year contract with the Magpies in June after the club avoided relegation on the final day of last season. Newcastle's next game is at leaders Leicester City on Monday. \"After the defeat to Bournemouth on Saturday, the club has spent some time considering its position and has today concluded that Steve McClaren's employment with the club will end with immediate effect. \"We acknowledge that reaching this decision has taken a number of days and that this has caused uncertainty for everyone involved, in particular for Steve and the players, for which we apologise. \"However, we felt that this time was necessary to ensure the right decisions were reached with the best interests of the club at heart. \"Managing director Lee Charnley added: 'I would like to thank Steve personally for his services to Newcastle United. \"'He is a man of integrity and class and he has conducted himself with great dignity during this difficult time. \"'Steve worked tirelessly to try and bring success to Newcastle United. \"'He has the utmost respect of all the players, staff and management and he leaves with our very best wishes and sincere thanks. \"'We feel that a change is now needed in order to give the club the best possible chance of securing its Premier League future. A further announcement on a successor to Steve will be made in due course.'\" Former Newcastle defender Steve Howey agreed with Lineker that the club's handling of McClaren's sacking had been \"pretty shambolic\". He added: \"That seems to sum Newcastle up at the moment. \"Everyone thought after the defeat by Bournemouth there would be discussions straight after the game with the board - which Steve is on - and a decision could be made before the new week started. \"It dragged on and, to be fair to Steve, he's shown superb professionalism. He's carried on knowing all along that he was going to be leaving.\" BBC Sport's chief football writer Phil McNulty: Steve McClaren was an uninspired, seemingly safe, appointment by Newcastle United after they escaped relegation from the Premier League on the final day of last season. Dismissed by Derby County after they failed to reach the Championship play-off despite strong financial backing, McClaren arrived as damaged goods. He was fortunate to get the job and it proved comprehensively beyond his capabilities, despite an \u00a380m expenditure since the summer, resulting in just six wins and a place in the relegation zone. But how much influence did McClaren have over transfer policy? Chief scout Graham Carr appears to wield the power, but McClaren took responsibility. This unwieldy system must be scrapped and the manager must be allowed to manage, otherwise Newcastle will never escape the shadow hanging permanently over this giant of a club. Media playback is not supported on this device McClaren spent about \u00a380m on players during his time at St James' Park, including \u00a330m on midfielders Jonjo Shelvey, Andros Townsend and Henri Saivet in January. However, the signings have failed to help improve the club's form and they have won just one of their past six league games, conceding 14 goals in defeats by Watford, Everton, Chelsea, Stoke and Bournemouth. As well as Newcastle, Derby and England, McClaren has managed Middlesbrough, Dutch side FC Twente and Wolfsburg in Germany.",

The competition kicked off on Friday evening as Ayr United beat neighbours Kilmarnock 1-0 in Group E. And the cup gets into full swing on Saturday, with 15 more games. Well have lost to two English National League sides in pre-season, while Hibs' games included a draw with Sunderland. Lennon's side beat Dunfermline Athletic and Berwick Rangers in pre-season and will host Montrose in the Group D match. \"I was never a lover of pre-season when I played and as a manager I never paid to much attention to the results either,\" lennon told HibsTV. \"It was all about getting the players fit, but I've been pleased so far. The players have done very well. \"We know what is ahead of us and we know what's at stake in the Betfred Cup. We want to go as far in the competition as we can, if not win it.\" Nigeria defender Efe Ambrose will not feature against the Gable Endies after arriving back at training two days late with the Edinburgh club. The 28-year-old, who was signed from Celtic this summer, said his delay was  because of a personal matter. Lennon said this has now been resolved. It is the second year of the new League Cup group-stage format, with Premiership rivals Ross County hosting League One's Alloa Athletic in Saturday's other Group D game. Motherwell are the top seeds in Group F, but the squad that is being reshaped by Robinson [nine players have arrived with 16 exiting] have suffered defeats by Gateshead and Barrow. \"The cup competition comes really, really early,\" the Well manager said before their trip to face League One side Queen's Park. \"I would rather have people 100% ready, but everybody's in the same boat. \"We will get better, especially our understanding. We brought in nine players and potentially one or two more. \"I think we need a bit of an injection of pace in the top end of the pitch, but we probably have to move people on first.\" One player Robinson has no intention of losing is Louis Moult, and the manager insisted the striker is ready to give 100% despite a rejected bid from Aberdeen. Group H top seeds Partick Thistle face a tricky opener at home to Livingston, who won promotion to the Championship. Thistle midfielder Stuart Bannigan is close to a return after 15 months on the sidelines through injury, but the 24-year-old is unlikely to feature as manager Alan Archibald is wary of rushing his recovery. Archibald is already without right-back Mustapha Dumbuya, who is facing a couple of months on the sidelines after having surgery on an injury. Fellow defender Niall Keown is also doubt after picking up a knock before leaving Reading. Archibald has therefore been forced back into the transfer market to find a new right-back as well as a new striker after Ade Azeez departed for Cambridge United. With Aberdeen, holders Celtic, Rangers and St Johnstone not featuring until the next round because they were in European competition, Hamilton Academical are the other top-flight side in action on Saturday. They made their first signing of the close season on Friday, with French central defender Xavier Tomas joining for an undisclosed fee from Swiss club Lausanne-Sport.

As we drove through the first small villages on the way to the capital Port-au-Prince, we could see the damage the hurricane was still inflicting. The roads were already awash with rushing muddy floodwaters, the people we passed were trying to cover themselves as best they could, but they were struggling just to move against the pouring rain. Haiti's capital is disorientating. You lose all sense of being on a tropical island in the Caribbean. It is a city crammed with people. Its broken buildings, sewage and rubbish-strewn streets are tough and the bad weather brought by the storm only makes them more inhospitable, but life goes on. We drove past busy street markets, people loaded on their bikes or walking with their shopping. This is a country used to disaster. It looked like the Haitians of Port-au-Prince were determined to carry on. We only began to see the real destructive force of Hurricane Matthew once we moved towards the south-west of the country. Trees fallen, banana crops uprooted and flattened, houses under water and men and women trying to get the debris out of the way. It was noticeable how the people we passed were coping alone. There were no army or police around to help. Even the aid agencies are struggling to move around this damaged corner of the country. As if the hurricane had not hurt the people and their lives enough, a crucial route to those hit hardest by the storm was destroyed. A bridge was washed away, leaving a wide muddy river between those who survived and the people stricken in the south. The people in this town split by the rushing brown river were trying to do their bit too. A man with a shovel hopelessly digging a hole in the ground, others chopping away trees that had fallen in the road. We were on the river bank looking at the misery, only to be told we were actually standing where four families' homes had stood just days before. More rain fell on now homeless people. A mother told us her children had just started school and their new uniforms had been washed away. Among the tears from those who lost their lives to the river, there was also laughter and cheers from people on the banks as others tried to cross. In the busy street, a bus had its doors open playing music, reminding us where we were.

He's moving around nimbly on crutches, putting everything into the training and drills. There are shouts for the ball, plenty of laughter but lots of hard work. After all some of the players here have their next competitive game in just over a week. Many of them do play on crutches, others with prosthetic limbs. The sport of amputee football has been going for many years south of the border and now a charity is now trying to form a Scotland-wide league. It is holding the first amputee football Scottish Cup in Edinburgh next month. This team I am watching is linked to Partick Thistle. \"I wish, looking back, I hadn't let it stop me,\" says Brian Murray, who lost his leg to cancer at the age of 10. He says that, although as a youngster he did play on crutches with his pals, when he went to secondary school he lost confidence and began wearing his prosthetic leg all the time. His introduction to amputee football was in England, regularly travelling to Everton to get a game. It is rough at times - he broke his collarbone last year, but did not let that put him off. He describes the sport now being in Scotland as \"brilliant\". \"That's what I want to give to youngsters,\" he says. \"Don't let anyone stop you, just go for it.\" He adds that if he is still playing at the age of 47, then \"it doesn't matter what age you are\". Amputee football is played all over the world. In Turkey, for instance, there is a professional league, aired on television with 600 players. Scotland is hoping to play some friendlies against other European countries later in the year. \"Amputee football is just about getting people out and playing football,\" says Ashley Reid of the Amputee Football Association Scotland (AFAS). \"The limb difference, the amputation is not relevant at all when people are here training. It's just about playing football.\" She says she saw a clear demand for the sport in Scotland. The task now is to try to spread out across the country. In among the men on the pitch is one woman. In fact, she is the only woman playing in the amputee football league in the UK. \"All amputees are used to being the odd one out in the crowd,\" Rebecca Sellar explains. \"So coming into this as the only woman, you get on with it and over it.\" She would like to get more women involved. Rebecca says that since she started she has been welcomed into the game and on a personal level has gained fitness as well as the enjoyment of taking part in a team sport. She says: \"Our numbers are growing and the more word we can get out there to encourage people to get involved the better we can have it as a sport for Scotland.\"",

Some two dozen behemoths were identified, all with masses in excess of a hundred times that of the Sun. Four were known previously, including the remarkable colossus catalogued as R136a1, which is 250 times as massive as our home star. But the new survey finds many more of the super-objects in a tight patch of sky within the Large Magellanic Cloud. \"In just a tiny bit of this satellite galaxy, we see perhaps a couple of dozen stars with more than a 100 solar masses, of which nine are in a tight core just a few light-years across,\" explained Prof Paul Crowther from Sheffield University, UK. \"But that two dozen number - that's probably more than are in the entire Milky Way Galaxy for this type of star,\" he told BBC News. The observations are to be published shortly in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. They build on earlier work reported in 2010 that first described R136a1 - the most massive and most luminous star identified to date. That study used data gathered principally by a ground-based telescope in Chile. This follow-up research employed the pin-sharp resolution and ultraviolet sensitivity of the orbiting Hubble telescope to tease out yet more detail. In 2010, astronomers saw four monster stars including R136a1 in the central core. Thanks to Hubble, they detect a further five. The stars are not only extremely massive, but they are also extremely bright. Together, these nine stars outshine our Sun by a factor of 30 million, said Prof Crowther. \"Because they are so massive, they are all close to their so-called Eddington limit, which is the maximum luminosity a star can have before it rips itself apart; and so they've got really powerful outflows. They are shedding mass at a fair rate of knots,\" the astronomer added - up to an Earth mass of gaseous material per month. The question is why this tight corner of space, located in the Tarantula Nebula of the LMC, harbours so many giants. Prof Crowther thinks it is because the gas and dust in the region has become compressed as the Large Magellanic Cloud has skirted the edge of the Milky Way. One thing is for sure - none of these monster stars will be around for more than a few million years. To burn so bright is to burn briefly. \"A lot of these stars will be in binaries (in pairs), and when they die they'll produce black holes, which will merge at some point in the dim and distant future. And when they do they'll produce gravitational waves. \"The first detection of gravitational waves [reported by Advanced LIGO last month] was from the merger of a pair of 30-solar-mass black holes. They probably came from 100-solar-mass stars.\" Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos",

Fellow Briton Stephen Cummings won the final stage from Le-Pont-de-Claix to Superdevoluy, but it was Froome who added to his 2013 and 2015 titles. The Team Sky rider had opened a 21-second lead heading into stage seven and held out to win by 12 seconds from Frenchman Romain Bardet. Froome won the Tour de France after both his previous Dauphine successes. This year's edition begins on 2 July. The 31-year-old had to survive some nervous moments in the final 15km on Sunday, as Spaniard Alberto Contador launched several accelerations on the penultimate climb. Bardet also tried his chances on a rapid descent between the final two climbs but Froome chased down every attack. Cummings, 35, was the last of a 20-man breakaway group to wilt and finished well clear of the chasing pack. Ireland's Dan Martin won the sprint for second with Bardet third, and both moved up a place in the overall standings thanks to the bonus points available on the line. Tasmanian Richie Porte, who started the day second, was caught out in the uphill sprint finish and lost two places.

Hundreds of performers in bandstands across the UK joined in a rendition of Coldplay's Viva La Vida. The band allowed musicians to play their 2008 single at 14:00 BST in a nationwide musical moment. The Bandstand Marathon was the official finale event of the London 2012 Festival. The 12-week festival was the climax of the Cultural Olympiad - a programme of arts events that has been running since 2008. Find your nearest bandstand With an overall investment of \u00c2\u00a355m - including lottery funding - the London 2012 element of the festival began on 21 June and closes on 9 September at the end of the Paralympic Games. Coldplay, meanwhile, are one of the star acts of the Paralympic Games closing ceremony on Sunday night. In Scotland this weekend, choreographer Michael Clark has created a large-scale, participatory dance event at Glasgow's music venue Barrowlands to mark the handover to the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games. Among the London 2012 Festival's most high-profile events were the mass bell-ringing on the opening day of the games, the World Shakespeare Festival, the Damien Hirst retrospective at Tate Modern and BBC Radio 1's Hackney Weekend. But the programme has included thousands of other events and performances across the UK. \"We haven't felt in competition with the sport,\" said London Festival director Ruth Mackenzie, as she previewed the final events this week. \"It's felt like the art and athletes have been working together - which is how it was in ancient Greece and it's what we always hoped for.\" Anish Kapoor's Orbit - the twisting steel structure that overlooks the Olympic Stadium - has been arguably the most visual symbol of the London 2012 Festival. \"Every time you look at the Olympic television coverage, you see Anish's wonderful sculpture towering above the stadium, not in competition, but as a collective celebration of talent,\" said Mackenzie. \"It's art back at the heart of the games.\" The London 2012 Festival opened in June with five headline events across England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Among them were Scotland's The Big Noise concert in Raploch, Stirling, led by superstar conductor Gustavo Dudamel; and a pyrotechnic show that lit up the shores of Windermere in Cumbria. At the beginning of August, organisers said more than 12 million people had taken part in the festival, basing their figures on ticket sales, attendance figures and surveys of the UK population. Approximately 2.9 million joined in with Martin Creed's All The Bells mass bell-ringing session, including then-Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt, whose bell flew off its handle, narrowly missing another participant. A further 9.6 million visited free events like the Hackney Weekend and the Tate Modern's oil tanks. Some 2.5 million people went to paid-for events such as the BBC Proms and the art exhibitions by Hirst and David Hockney. Updated audience figures will be announced next week, as the focus shifts to the festival's legacy. One thing under consideration is whether the UK should hold a biennial arts festival. Cultural Olympiad chairman Tony Hall and Mackenzie have been asked to report back to the Culture Secretary on its feasibility. \"We always said the first thing was to have a great festival and to make sure that people had Olympic and Paralympic magic all round the UK,\" said Mackenzie. \"The second thing is to make the most of the legacy of that,\" she added. \"There are measurables like audience numbers and economic impact, but then there are the unmeasurables - such as the memories and new experiences of art they have had.\"",

        "article": "Every day since 28 November, 10-year-old Rohit Kumar has sat from dawn to dusk on the banks of the Gandak river in the eastern Indian state of Bihar with a magnetic fishing line trying to fish out coins from the water. He is among the hundreds of boys who collect coins thrown into the river by visitors and devotees during the annual month-long Sonepur fair, which is said to be Asia's biggest cattle fair. Armed with heavy magnetic rings tied with colourful plastic ropes, Rohit is at work every day from 5am to 5pm. For a month, he is missing school. \"I fish out around 100 rupees [$1.83; \u00c2\u00a31.14] to 110 rupees every day and my mother is happy with my efforts,\" says Rohit. His father, Shatrughan Singh, is a day labourer who earns a similar amount on the days he can find work. Rohit hands over the money he collects to his parents and it goes a long way in helping feed their family of six. Rohit first started going to the river bank two years ago after he saw other village boys going every morning with their fishing lines. \"I was curious, so one day I went along with them and learned the tricks of the trade,\" he said. He borrowed 10 rupees ($0.18; \u00c2\u00a30.11) from his mother, promising to return double the money in the evening. At the beginning of the cattle fair, hundreds of thousands of Hindu devotees bathe at the confluence of the Gandak and Ganges rivers in Sonepur, in Saran district, 35km (21 miles) north of the state capital, Patna. The devout also throw coins in the river as a mark of their devotion and reverence. As soon as a coin is thrown into the water, the hawk-eyed little boys throw their magnets in the same direction, much like the fishermen throwing their nets into the sea. \"I generally collect coins worth 150 rupees ($2.70; \u00c2\u00a31.70) a day and most of the time my family buys food with this money,\" said Rakesh Kumar, another coin collector. Rakesh's father, Suresh Rai, runs a tea stall at the fair ground and has a large family of nine members. Rakesh and his sibling Bittu Kumar come to the river bank every morning at the crack of dawn and leave only after at 5pm. \"My rope has just a single magnet which is not very effective. I'll buy a bigger one soon so that I can collect more coins,\" Rakesh said. Gruelling poverty His friend Krishna Kumar, who also collects coins worth 100-150 rupees a day, says their work is not easy. \"I spend almost 10 hours a day on the river bank, with my eyes fixed on the coins thrown into the water. Sometimes I get them, sometime I lose to other friends,\" he said as he displayed a coin he had just fished out of water. Krishna says he keeps a part of the money he makes \"to buy some sweets at the fair\". \"When the fair begins, one can see hundreds of young coin collectors here. See how they have used local technology to fish out coins from water,\" Radheshyam Panda, who performs religious rituals on the river bank, said. \"These young coin collectors may use different magnet sizes or different colours of plastic ropes but one thing which they have in common is their gruelling poverty,\" said Mahendra Babu who sells ingredients for religious ceremonies on the river bank.",

        "article": "This week a giant coal mine that could produce millions of tonnes of coal for export to India was scuttled by two Australian reptiles. After a five-year approval process, the humble Yakka Skink - a secretive lizard known to hide under rocks and inside hollow logs - and the Ornamental Snake brought to a halt a A$16bn ($12bn; \u00c2\u00a38bn) mine, rail and port project proposed for the Galilee Basin in Queensland. The two reptiles are among Australia's most threatened species. Because the federal environment minister failed to take into account what the mine could mean for their habitat, his earlier approval for the mine was overturned by the Federal Court of Australia. The mine may still go ahead but the delay is the latest chapter in a long history of Australian flora and fauna causing grief to developers. Back in 1995, one of the last known colonies of the endangered Green and Gold Bell frog delayed the construction of a multi-million dollar residential development in inner-city Sydney. A few years later, the frogs were found frolicking in an abandoned brick pit where authorities had planned to build a tennis court for the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games. The courts were built elsewhere while the frogs got a specially built habitat. Now they are in the way of a key major road project in Sydney. In the mid 2000s, a new species of flowering shrub was discovered in the Lower Hunter Valley, north of Sydney. Named Persoonia pauciflora, botanists were excited to discover it grew nowhere else in the world. Unfortunately, it was growing on the site of a proposed housing development. When word got around, someone ripped out 300 of the last 500 of these rare plants. The culprit was never found. The discovery of a threatened or new species can cause havoc for developers, delaying or even putting an end to a project. What overturned the Queensland mine's approval? A small conservation group in Mackay, Queensland, challenged the environment minister's decision to approve the mine on a number of legal bases, including: Approved Conservation Advices are scientific and legal documents that explain the conservation requirements of species to avoid their extinction. It was this last point that convinced the court to overturn the minister's approval. In the state of Victoria, the Orange-bellied Parrot was centre stage in a long-running saga about whether a wind farm could be built in South Gippsland. The federal environment minister banned the 52-turbine project in 2006, on advice that turbine blades posed a small risk to the critically endangered bird. The minister eventually reversed his own decision and the wind farm is going ahead. In the case of Indian company Adani's giant coal mine in Queensland, environmentalists and scientists are worried about more than threats to reptiles. Dredging associated with an expansion of port facilities for the mine poses a huge risk to the Great Barrier Reef; exports would further entrench the world's reliance on carbon polluting fossil fuels; and the mine could threaten artesian water. The Department of the Environment on Wednesday said reconsideration of the project did not require revisiting the entire approval process. New approval documentation could be ready within eight weeks. Adani described the court decision as simply a \"technical legal error\". But environmentalists say protecting endangered species is vital work. \"To describe an endangered species as a technicality and groundwater as a technicality is in line with Adani's environmental record around the world, which is appalling,\" said Geoff Cousins, president of the Australian Conservation Foundation. \"The government should simply strike this project down.\"",

The charity said there had been a total of 137 convictions in the same period. The maximum sentence for offenders is six months in prison and/or an unlimited fine, but campaigners want it to be raised to up to three years. Brian Wheelhouse, who runs a dog rescue centre, said offenders only cared about financial gain and not about the dog. Eduardo Goncalves, chief executive of the League Against Cruel Sports, said: \"Evidence from the UK and abroad points to the activity being a 'gateway' crime to serious and organised offences, such as drug and gun crime. \"In the United States dog fighting is recognised as a Grade A felony by the FBI.\" France applies a sentence of up to two years, and Germany and the Czech Republic apply a sentence of up to three years. The RSPCA said the highest number of calls it had received had been in Greater London (924), followed by the West Midlands (469), West Yorkshire (305) and Greater Manchester (238). Rural counties are also affected, including the areas of Kent, Essex and Lancashire. Get the data for your area here The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said there were \"strict laws in place\" to deal with people who were not properly looking after animals. A spokesman said: \"Anyone who is cruel to an animal or does not provide for its welfare needs may be banned from owning animals, given an unlimited fine or sent to prison.\" Campaigners including the League Against Cruel Sports, the RSPCA and the Dogs Trust, along with the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) have all called for tougher sentencing as a deterrent. Deputy Chief Constable Gareth Pritchard, the NPCC's lead for dangerous dogs, said \"this kind of animal abuse\" caused \"untold distress and harm to the animals involved\". We had a call from the dog compound. There was concern because this dog had obviously been used for dog fighting, or as dog bait, with the injuries it had sustained. A dog that attacks another dog will go for the jugular vein - for the neck - so Benji has got injuries all around his neck, [and] around his face. Dog fighting is done by individuals that are fighting them for financial gain. They're not bothered what happens to the dog at the end of the day as long as it wins. They're not bothered about the injuries because they're not going to be taking it to the vets and having it treated. They'll leave it to heal up by itself. If the dog dies then so be it. To inflict injuries and do horrible things on these poor creatures just beggar's belief. Last year, two kittens were found in Bradford with their fur coloured using marker pens. It is thought they were to have been used as bait in a dog fight, where people would have bet on which one would have died first. They came in through a police officer who'd been to a property and seized them. We'd never seen anything quite like it before - one was coloured blue with a marker pen, and one was green. Thankfully nothing terrible had happened before they came to us. We believe that they may have been coloured in to be used for dog fighting. It was horrendous and we were thinking those cats were probably minutes away from being ripped to shreds by dogs, and they were tiny. We're aware of other incidents where cats have been used as bait for dog fighting.",

It said 50 were also wounded in the Hijaz Square explosion, which hit the offices of the railway company. Eight people were also killed by a rare blast in the town of Suweida, home to Syria's Druze minority, say reports. Suweida has remained under government control through the conflict, and had so far been largely free of violence. Wednesday's blast there went off outside the headquarters of the Air Force Intelligence, the most feared security service in Syria. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based activist group, said it had been a suicide car bomb and that the intelligence branch chief was among those killed. Sana blamed the attack on \"terrorists\", the government's way of referring to rebels forces. Syria's Druze minority - adherents of an offshoot of Shia Islam - numbers about 700,000. Its main leadership has so far stayed out of the conflict publicly. The Observatory said were conflicting reports about whether the Damascus explosion had been caused by a bomb or a mortar shell. No group has said it was behind the blast but Sana again quoted police sources blaming \"terrorists. Last month, an explosion near Damascus airport cut off power to large parts of Syria. The attacks come a day after the latest round of international diplomacy failed to fix a date for a long-delayed peace conference on the Syrian conflict. The UN-Arab League envoy on Syria, Lakhdar Brahimi, had hoped to hold the conference in Geneva this month. But he said he was not able to announce a date, despite a day of meetings first with senior diplomats from the US and Russia, then with the other permanent members of the UN Security Council - the UK, France and China - as well as Syria's neighbours Lebanon, Iraq, Jordan and Turkey. Mr Brahimi said he was still \"striving\" for a summit by the end of the year. Interactive: Tent city now home to 130,000 Attempts to set up a conference have been going on for months amid disputes over who should attend and its agenda. The Syrian opposition has insisted President Bashar al-Assad should resign before any talks can take begin, but the government has rejected this. The US and Russia disagree on whether Syria's key regional neighbour Iran should be present. The idea of a conference was first mooted in May, and in September UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon announced a tentative date of mid-November after the Security Council passed a binding resolution on Syrian chemical weapons. On Wednesday, Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov was quoted as saying that Moscow was ready to host \"informal\" talks between President Assad and the Syrian opposition to begin the peace process. Mr Bogdanov, who was involved in the talks with Mr Brahimi, said such a meeting would help to create \"a favourable atmosphere, so that people can meet and discuss existing issues\", Russian media quoted him as saying. Source: UNHCR - Nov 2013 Meanwhile, aid agencies have warned that more than nine million Syrians, almost half the population, are now in need of humanitarian relief. The UN estimates that more than two million people have fled Syria since the unrest began in March 2011, resulting in a humanitarian crisis.

        "article": "A multi-million pound legal bill racked-up in a failed case against six people accused of a fraud conspiracy is to be paid by the Serious Fraud Office. The men included lawyer and ex-Cardiff City chief executive Alan Whiteley, and former Celtic Energy directors Richard Walters and Leighton Humphreys. They had been accused of conspiracy to defraud the Coal Authority, Neath Port Talbot, Bridgend, and Powys councils. But the case was dismissed and the judge said no law had been broken. The case centred on an accusation that the men had been planning to set up a firm in the British Virgin Islands in order to transfer the leases of four Welsh opencast mining sites owned by Celtic Energy in order to avoid it having to restore the sites once coal extraction had ended. They had been arrested in 2011 and it took nearly three years to come to court. But after five days of legal submissions, Lord Justice Hickinbottom threw the Serious Fraud Office's case out saying that the six defendants had not acted unlawfully regardless of whether or not they had acted dishonestly. The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) applied to the High Court to continue the prosecution under a little-used legal tool called a \"voluntary bill of indictment\" but that was also thrown out. Nearly a year after the case was dismissed, the High Court sitting in Cardiff made a judgement that the legal costs of the multi-million pound case should be paid by the SFO. The costs claim is for \u00c2\u00a37m, to cover the cost of 10 barristers and two separate High Court hearings. The SFO, which disputes it, said it is \"considering possible avenues of appeal\" on the issue of costs. The order to pay the costs has potential ramifications for the SFO, which has been heavily criticised for its handling of other cases including the investigation of the Tchenguiz brothers. That case resulted in the organisation having to pay millions of pounds in costs and damages to the property developers. Eric Evans, solicitor Alan Whiteley, solicitor Stephen Davies, barrister Richard Walters, managing director Celtic Energy Leighton Humphreys, finance director Celtic Energy They were represented by 10 barristers including five QCs, while the SFO had two barristers For a serious fraud to be successfully prosecuted, it's all down to sufficient evidence, well presented to the jury so it is easily understood. But this particular case was flawed from its inception - it was difficult to prepare and present to the jury and I don't think there was joined up thinking in the way it was investigated. This is a stark reminder for the SFO and the CPS that they should not take on cases of that magnitude, cost and resource when they don't think they have a very good prospect of success. I imagine this has cost the SFO about 25% of its annual budget. And I think there has to be serious questions asked over the current set up of the SFO - which is known in certain circles as the \"seriously flawed office\". Is it fit for purpose? Or is another branch needed to investigate cases such as these? If that is the case, that could be the death knell for the SFO. Eric Evans said the case against them had been \"wholly flawed\" and it was another example of a \"misconceived\" SFO blockbuster case. \"In an attempt to prosecute me with an offence not known to law they have repeatedly changed their case.\" Alan Whitely said he felt relieved and vindicated, adding: \"Having lived and breathed it for four years, there are a number of questions the SFO need to address, in terms of how they go about their investigations. \"It's my understanding they're supposed to be an investigative body but our experience hasn't really proved that.\"",

        "article": "Northern Ireland's top education official has accused teachers of harming children's education by taking industrial action. In a strongly worded letter to all teachers, Gavin Boyd also said they got better pay than their counterparts in England and Wales. Teaching unions are refusing to co-operate with school inspections in a dispute over pay and workload. Some are also taking occasional strike action. The National Association of Schoolmasters and Women Teachers (NASUWT) has reacted angrily to Mr Boyd's letter, accusing him of \"fake news\". Mr Boyd is chief executive of the Education Authority and represents the teaching employers in negotiations over the current pay dispute. He wrote that the industrial action was \"seriously affecting the education of children and young people\" and \"the effective operation of schools\". He also said teachers had been \"confused by misinformation\" on a number of issues. \"The average teacher's pay in Northern Ireland is just over \u00c2\u00a340,000 per annum,\" he added. \"This compares very favourably with other graduate professions locally and is actually higher than the average teacher's pay in England and Wales.\" He said that teaching unions had rejected an overall offer of 2.5% on pay in 2015-16. \"There have been no reductions in teacher's pay,\" he said. Mr Boyd conceded that national insurance and pension contributions had risen, but said these were \"part of a wider government strategy to ensure public sector pensions remain affordable and sustainable\". \"Public sector pensions remain attractive and in general offer much better terms than those available in the private sector.\" However, the NASUWT's general secretary Chris Keates said his letter would infuriate teachers. \"Teachers will not be persuaded or intimidated by the fake news presented in the letter,\" she said. \"The value of teachers' pay has fallen by around 20% since 2010. \"The employers should start to devote more of their time to addressing the genuine concerns of teachers rather than peddling misinformation.\" The letter will not help to resolve disputes between teachers and their employers, said Heather Watson, the principal of Phoenix Integrated Primary School in Cookstown, County Tyrone. She was \"shocked, confused and disappointed\" when she received the letter. \"It hasn't done anything to reassure teachers that they are respected and valued,\" said Ms Watson. \"I understand that there are two sides to this, but I really want the two sides to get their act together and address the issues.\" Jim Clarke, the chief executive of the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools, which represents teachers' employers, said the information in the letter was \"factually accurate\". \"It might not necessarily agree with everyone's perspective but all we can do is present the facts as they are,\" he added. In a related development, the Irish National Teachers' Organisation (INTO) has accused the Department of Education of \"attempts at bullying\" by writing to a Catholic archbishop about the ongoing industrial action. In a letter to members, INTO said that the Department of Education's permanent secretary Derek Baker had written to Archbishop Eamon Martin. They said Mr Baker had requested that Archbishop Martin ensures that school governors co-operate with school inspections. \"Attempts at bullying, such as this, should be rejected as an unsubtle attempt to bring the action to an end,\" they wrote. However, in a statement to the BBC, the department responded by describing the claim as \"utter nonsense\". \"The letter focuses exclusively on the statutory duty placed on governors in respect of safeguarding and promoting the welfare of pupils and seeks their cooperation with the ETI specifically in respect of child protection and safeguarding,\" they said. \"The suggestion that the department's letter amounts to bullying is utter nonsense\".",

        "article": "More than 100 Afghan soldiers were killed or wounded in a Taliban attack on an army base on Friday, the defence ministry has confirmed. Fighting lasted for several hours near the city of Mazar-e Sharif in northern Balkh province. Insurgents targeted those leaving Friday prayers at the base's mosque and others in a canteen, the army said. The Taliban said in a statement they had carried out the attack, using suicide bombers to breach defences. Earlier estimates put the death toll as high as 134, but a statement from the defence ministry on Saturday gave the figure of more than 100 killed or injured. It is one of the deadliest tolls in a Taliban attack on the Afghan army. At least 10 Taliban militants were also killed in the fighting and one attacker was detained. The Afghan government has declared Sunday a day of national mourning. Separately, the US military command in Afghanistan said that Taliban commander Quari Tayib had been killed in a coalition air strike. It said that Tayib was \"once known as the shadow Taliban governor of Takhar province\" in the north-east, and was killed along with eight other Taliban fighters in the strike on 17 April. The Taliban fighters who attacked the base wore army uniforms and drove through checkpoints to launch the raid, a military spokesman said. One injured soldier, Mohammad Hussain, said: \"When I came out of the mosque, three people with army uniforms and an army vehicle started shooting at us. Of course, they had some infiltrators inside the base, otherwise they would never have been able to enter. \"One of them sitting inside a vehicle had set up a machine gun at the car's window and shot everyone in his way.\" President Ashraf Ghani flew to the area on Saturday and visited wounded troops. US military spokesman John Thomas described the attack as a \"significant\" strike, but he praised Afghan commandos for bringing the \"atrocity to an end\". There are conflicting reports about casualties. The defence ministry confirmed more than 100 soldiers had been \"killed or injured\" but a security official in Mazar-e Sharif told the BBC that more than 100 had died, including a top military commander. Relatives of some of the soldiers gathered outside the base to take possession of coffins. They all questioned the security measures in place at the main entrance. \"If strict inspections had taken place, the attackers would not have passed the first gate,\" said Jan Agah, from Jowzjan province. One of his nephews serving at the base died and another was injured in the attack. The raid shows the Taliban can plan and carry out complex attacks. The militants said four of the attackers had served as soldiers for a long time and had knowledge of every corner of the base. The base at Mazar-e-Sharif is home to the Afghan National Army's 209th Corps, responsible for providing security to most of northern Afghanistan, including Kunduz province - which has seen heavy recent fighting. Several German and other foreign soldiers are reported to be garrisoned there. Last month about 50 people were reported to have died when militants believed to be from the group known as Islamic State targeted patients and staff at a military hospital in Kabul with guns, grenades and knives. Also in March the Taliban said they had captured the crucial south Afghan district of Sangin after a year-long battle.",

Walker, who has 27 caps and spent eight seasons at Spurs has signed a five-year deal with City. The deal, which comes to \u00a350m including \u00a35m of add-ons, could make him the most expensive English player ever. \"I am thrilled to be signing for City and can't wait to get started,\" said Walker. \"Pep Guardiola is one of the most respected managers in the world.\" Walker, who joined Spurs from Sheffield United in 2009 and made 183 Premier League appearances, added: \"I feel he can help me take my game to a new level.\" The 27-year-old, who will wear the number two shirt, is expected to travel with City on Monday for their tour of the USA. City boss Guardiola released three full-backs at the end of last season, including both right-sided players - Pablo Zabaleta and Bacary Sagna. He missed out on the signing of free agent Dani Alves, with the Brazilian joining Paris St-Germain on Wednesday. Walker, selected in the 2016-17 Premier League team of the year, is City's third signing of the summer, after the arrivals of midfielder Bernardo Silva and goalkeeper Ederson Moraes. Walker made 31 league starts under Mauricio Pochettino last season as Tottenham recorded their highest top-flight finish since the 1962-63 season. The right-back recorded five assists for the Premier League runners-up, the joint-most for a defender in the division alongside Bournemouth's Adam Smith and Spurs team-mate Kieran Trippier, who made six of his 12 appearances from the bench. Walker also ranked highly among chances created by defenders and his 75 dribbles attempted was only less than Cherries full-back Smith (87) and Watford's Jose Holebas (88). Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker on Twitter: Kyle Walker becomes the world's most expensive defender at \u00a350m plus. Imagine how much he would cost if he could cross the ball. Former Spurs midfielder and Match of the Day pundit Jermaine Jenas\u200f on Twitter: I think it's great business for City. I am surprised Spurs are selling to a direct competitor.

        "article": "At least 85 people died when a gunman opened fire at an island youth camp in Norway, hours after a bombing in the capital Oslo killed seven, police say. Police have charged a 32-year-old Norwegian man over both attacks. The man dressed as a police officer was arrested on tiny Utoeya island after an hour-long shooting spree. Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg said many people were still looking for their children and had not so far been able to locate them. He was speaking after meeting victims and relatives with Norway's King Harald, Queen Sonja and Crown Prince Haakon in the town of Sundvollen near the island. Values attackedHome-grown plot?In pictures: Shock Mr Stoltenberg said he was \"deeply touched\" by the meetings. \"We will do whatever we can to give them as much support as possible,\" he said. Earlier he said that he was due to have been on Utoeya - \"a youth paradise turned into a hell\" - a few hours after the attack took place. The suspect is reported by local media to have had links with right-wing extremists. He has been named as Anders Behring Breivik. Police searched his Oslo apartment overnight and are questioning him. The BBC's Richard Galpin, near the island which is currently cordoned off by police, says that Norway has had problems with neo-Nazi groups in the past but the assumption was that such groups had been largely eliminated and did not pose a significant threat. Police say they are investigating whether the attacks were the work of one man or whether others helped. \"At Utoeya, the water is still being searched for more victims,\" deputy police chief Roger Andresen told reporters. \"We have no more information than... what has been found on [his] own websites, which is that it goes towards the right and that it is, so to speak, Christian fundamentalist.\" By Richard GalpinBBC News, near Utoeya A search is going on not just on the island itself, but also in the waters around it because a lot of people tried to escape by jumping in the water and trying to swim away. Even as they did that, eyewitnesses say, the gunman opened fire on them. The chatter now is that it took the police an hour, if not an hour and a half, to actually get to the island. Of course that gave the gunman so much time to kill so many people. Also crucially, the police were throwing all their resources at the huge bomb attack which had just taken place in the centre of Oslo. But still, the question will be asked: Were there not police nearer to this area who could have moved in much more quickly? Local media report that police are investigating claims by witnesses that a second person was involved, apparently not disguised in a police uniform. A farm supply firm has confirmed selling six tonnes of fertiliser to Mr Breivik who is reported to have run a farming company. Speculation has been rife that fertiliser could have been used in the Oslo bomb. The number killed in the island shooting spree, which is among the world's most deadly, had been put at 10 on Friday - but soared overnight. Hundreds of young people had been attending the summer camp organised by the governing Labour Party on Utoeya island. Eyewitnesses described how a tall, blond man dressed as a policeman opened fire indiscriminately, prompting camp attendees to jump into the water to try to escape the hail of bullets. Some of the teenagers were shot at as they tried to swim to safety. Armed police were deployed to the island but details of the operation to capture the suspect remain unclear. After his arrest he was charged with committing acts of terrorism. Profile: Anders Behring Breivik Police say they discovered many more victims after searching the area around the island. They have warned the death toll may rise further as rescue teams continue to scour the waters around the island. The gunman is reported to have been armed with a handgun, an automatic weapon and a shotgun. \"He travelled on the ferry boat from the mainland over to that little inland island posing as a police officer, saying he was there to do research in connection with the bomb blasts,\" NRK journalist Ole Torp told the BBC. \"He asked people to gather round and then he started shooting, so these young people fled into the bushes and woods and some even swam off the island to get to safety.\" One 15-year-old eyewitness described how she saw what she thought was a police officer open fire. \"He first shot people on the island. Afterward he started shooting people in the water,\" youth camp delegate Elise told Associated Press. The attacks sparked strong international condemnation, with US President Barack Obama expressing his condolences and offering support. Britain's Queen Elizabeth II spoke of her shock and sadness in a letter to King Harald. In Oslo, government officials urged people to stay at home and avoid central areas of the city. Shards of twisted metal, rubble and glass littered the streets of central Oslo left devastated by Friday's enormous explosion. Windows in the buildings of the government quarter were shattered and witnesses described how smoke filled the atmosphere around the blast site. The BBC's John Sopel in Oslo says there is a heavy military presence, with checkpoints around the quarter. Mr Stoltenberg said civil servants were among the dead in Oslo and he knew some of those killed. There are also concerns that more victims may still be inside buildings hit by the initial massive explosion.",

It comes as Iraqi government forces are \"on the cusp\" of retaking the city - held by IS since 2014, the UK Defence Secretary says. Meanwhile, a senior RAF commander says IS has been firing surface-to-air missiles at coalition planes. But so far no aircraft has been hit. Lieutenant General Mark Carleton-Smith said the military had assumed IS possessed missiles capable of bringing down an aircraft but had not been targeted by them until recently. Missiles fired at coalition aircraft have been detected as they were launched, enabling the targeted planes to take defensive action using flares, which cause the missiles to explode before they hit. The Iraqi government and Kurdish Peshmerga forces intend to launch an offensive on IS in Mosul  in the coming weeks. Mr Fallon told reporters: \"Having spoken to the commanders of the troops involved, their self-belief and determination is very clear. \"Though Mosul is a large and complex city, it will fall and will fall soon.\" Read student's secretly kept diary of life under IS By Jonathan Beale, BBC defence correspondent Over the past two years British warplanes have carried out more than a thousand airstrikes, in which they have dropped more than 2,000 bombs and missiles on what they say are IS targets in both Syria and Iraq. They are not the only ones who've been looking for targets. For the first time, the RAF has confirmed its aircraft have been fired at too - with IS anti-aircraft fire and shoulder-launched surface to air missiles - though they say they've always dealt with the threat. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said the focus of the air campaign was now turning towards Mosul, the last major city in Iraq still under IS control. He said the offensive to liberate the city would begin within weeks but he admitted that pushing IS out of Syria would be much harder. He added that the air force, which is targeting more than 100 locations in and around the city, was now operating \"at the highest tempo in a single theatre for over 25 years\".

The record follows a break during which singer Billie Joe Armstrong went to rehab for prescription pill addiction and touring guitarist Jason White received treatment for tonsil cancer. \"To have a chart-topping album at this stage of our career is especially gratifying,\" the band said. As with 2004's American Idiot, the record is a critique of US society. The album's first single, Bang Bang, addresses the culture of mass shootings, telling the story of one such incident through the eyes of a perpetrator. The title track was written after Armstrong joined a march in Manhattan, New York, protesting against a grand jury's decision not to indict a white police officer for the killing of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson. \"It was happening all over the country,\" he told Rolling Stone magazine. \"It was a trip to see people rebel against the old order. \"I was feeling that people don't want to feel obsolete in the things that we care about.\" Revolution Radio outsold its nearest competitor, Barry Gibb's In The Now, by a ratio of two to one, said the Official Charts Company.

        "article": "The Nelson Mandela Foundation (NMF) has called for South Africa's President Jacob Zuma to be sacked. He had \"failed the test\" of leadership and South Africa needed to hold to account those who were \"looting\" state resources, it said. Mr Zuma has been dogged by allegations of corruption for more than a decade. The call by the NMF, which is run by colleagues of South Africa's first black president, is the latest sign of growing discontent with his rule. Its intervention came as a court began hearing a bid by Mr Zuma's legal team to prevent the release of a report by former anti-corruption chief Thuli Madonsela. She investigated allegations that he let the wealthy Gupta family wield undue influence in his government. Both Mr Zuma and the Guptas have denied any wrongdoing. In a statement entitled Time to account for crippling the state, the NMF said the governing African National Congress (ANC) needed to take steps to put the government back in \"safe and capable hands\". \"Twenty years since Nelson Mandela signed South Africa's constitution into law and as the third anniversary of his passing approaches, it is painful for us at the Nelson Mandela Foundation to bear witness to the wheels coming off the vehicle of our state,\" the NMF added. Mr Mandela spent more than 27 years in prison for fighting white-minority rule and became South Africa's first democratically elected leader in 1994.  He stepped down five years later and died in December 2013 at the age of 95. The NMF said South Africa's democracy was now under a \"real threat\", with key government institutions being used to advance \"private interests\". \"We are reaping the results of a political trend of personalising matters of state around a single individual leader. This in a constitutional democracy is to be deplored,\" it added. Ms Madonsela's investigation was triggered by allegations in March by Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas that the Gupta family had made \"a mockery of our hard-earned democracy\" by offering him the finance minister's post last year. Mr Jonas said he rejected the offer; the Guptas accused him of political point-scoring. Former ANC MP Vytjie Mentor also alleged that the family offered her the powerful public enterprise minister's post in 2010 in exchange for business favours. Ms Mentor alleged that Mr Zuma was in another part of the Gupta's family home in Johannesburg when the offer was made. Mr Zuma's office said at the time that he had no \"recollection\" of Ms Mentor, while the family strongly denied her allegation. Ms Mentor and opposition parties, including the Democratic Alliance (DA) and Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), are challenging Mr Zuma in court, insisting that the report be released. EFF supporters are protesting outside the High Court in the capital, Pretoria, to demand its publication. Mr Zuma's court action prevented Ms Madonsela from publishing the report before she stepped down as public protector at the end of her term last month. He said it would be unlawful to release the report as he had not been given enough time to respond to the allegations. This was the second time  Ms Madonsela investigated Mr Zuma during her seven-year term. In March, South Africa's highest court upheld her findings that Mr Zuma \"unduly benefited\" from government money used to upgrade his private rural home. It led to widespread calls for Mr Zuma to resign, but he survived a DA-sponsored impeachment vote in parliament after ANC MPs rallied behind him. Correspondents say while the contents of Ms Madonsela's latest report are unclear, Mr Zuma will almost certainly face another impeachment vote if there are any adverse findings about him. The president is also at the centre of another case and is trying to overturn a unanimous ruling of a High Court that he should stand trial on 783 counts of corruption in relation to an arms deal negotiated in 1999.",

Resuming on 193-7, still needing 65 to make the visitors bat again, Leach (90) and Barnard (42) put on 100 to help Worcestershire post 349. Leach then claimed two wickets to leave the Foxes wobbling on 43-2. But Paul Horton (75*) and Mark Cosgrove (58*) saw Leicestershire to the close on 172-2, a healthy lead of 230. In company with fellow former Shropshire all-rounder Barnard, Leach fell just 10 runs short of his first century for three years. Despite Leicestershire all-rounder Clint McKay taking a tidy 4-59 from 24.1 overs, it left Worcestershire only 58 in arrears on first innings. Leach then broke through in each of his opening two overs as Angus Robson slashed a delivery to point before first-innings centurion Neil Dexter was brilliantly stumped by Ben Cox. But captain Cosgrove and former Lancashire skipper Horton got on top to leave the visitors, who started the game 13 points ahead of the home side in fourth, pushing for a third Championship win of the campaign. Worcestershire all-rounder Joe Leach told BBC Hereford & Worcester: \"It has been pretty good old-fashioned attritional cricket throughout the day. The pitch dictates that to a certain extent. It is not the quickest and with not much going on for the seam bowlers or the spinners. \"We were up against it after the poor session we had on Monday evening so, to stay in the game, it was imperative that we had a good morning with the bat and got as close as we could to them. \"It is mine and Ed Barnard's natural game to try and get on with it and, in the end, we can be satisfied with finishing 50-odd behind on first innings from the position we got ourselves into.\" Leicestershire all-rounder Clint McKay told BBC Radio Leicester: \"It didn't go probably as well as we hoped this morning but that's cricket and they batted very well and we probably weren't at our best with the ball. The game drifted away from us quite a bit. \"But we bounced back after lunch, got a couple of quick wickets and batted quite nicely in the final session to set ourselves up for going into day four. \"With my four wickets, there were a couple of lucky ones in there but it is a hard slog. You get wickets like that now and then.  It is all about running in and making it as hard as we can for the batters.\"",

A horse-drawn chaise post retraced the route taken in 1815 from Old Royal Naval College, in Greenwich, to St James's Square, where news from Belgium was delivered to the Prince Regent. A procession to mark the occasion has also taken place in central London. Events have been staged in Belgium and the UK to remember the battle. In June 1815 - following the victory of the Duke of Wellington's allied forces over Napoleon's French army - Major Harry Percy left Belgium carrying a letter written by the Duke relaying news from the battlefield to an expectant nation. But the ship carrying the dispatch began to drift in the English Channel, resulting in the men having to row the 20 miles to shore, landing at Broadstairs, in Kent. From there, the dispatch was taken by carriage to the Prince Regent, who was at a dinner party in London. Once there, the Prince Regent initially thought Major Percy - who was still covered in blood from the fighting - was bearing bad news. But once told of Wellington's victory, guests then rushed into the street to celebrate. Actors dressed as Major Percy and Commander James White - who also helped to carry the original victory message - have retraced the original three-day journey from Waterloo. They travelled across London in horse-drawn carriage, along with replicas of two captured Imperial Eagles and Standards of the French army. An actor playing Major Percy delivered the message at the East India Club in St James's Square - where the message of victory was originally received by the Prince Regent - in front of Princess Anne. He told the Princess Royal: \"I've come to you directly from the Duke of Wellington's headquarters in the village of Waterloo. \"His grace, along with our Dutch and Belgian allies, and the Prussian forces as well, have met the Corsican Empire in the field and have dealt him the most shattering defeat.\" The eagles were then presented to the Princess Royal. The carriage then joined the Waterloo Parade along The Mall, accompanied by military bands. Julian Farrance, who played Major Percy during the commemoration, said the whole experience had been \"simply astonishing\". \"It has been an astonishing privilege for us to be able to do this - to be able to ride the post chaise through the middle of town, but also to have started out at Waterloo and followed this journey through.\" The 200th anniversary of the battle has seen a series of events re-enacting important moments. On Saturday a huge re-enactment of the Battle of Waterloo took place in the same Belgian fields where Napoleon's army was defeated. Around 6,000 volunteers dressed as infantry and cavalry officers to recreate the battle and commemorate those who died. The volunteers dressed as soldiers, with 300 horses and 100 cannon, carefully re-enacted the battle for a crowd of 60,000 spectators. On Thursday, the Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall and Prime Minister David Cameron were among guests at a commemoration service at St Paul's Cathedral in London.",

Luke Gale put Tigers ahead, grounding a loose ball after Salford failed to handle a high kick. Murdoch-Masila's try reduced the deficit to two as Gareth O'Brien missed the conversion, but Greg Minkin powered over to extend Castleford's lead. Murdoch-Masila scored his second try to get Salford within two points, before O'Brien's penalty and drop-goal won it. Castleford had been top of Super League before the game after winning their opening four matches, but Wigan's draw with Huddersfield means they fall to second in the table. Tigers are the leading scorers in the competition this season, but they struggled to break down a resilient Salford defence. O'Brien missed his first attempt at a drop-goal, but Castleford knocked on from the restart to allow the former Tigers loanee a second effort. His kick earned Salford their third win of the season, taking them up to fifth in the early table.

Security consultant Paul Moore examined the publicly available information of the UK's six biggest ISPs. He said he found plenty of bugs that could be exploited by hackers. But he said most ISPs had been in contact with him and had worked to tighten security once told of the issues. The audit of TalkTalk, Sky, BT, Plusnet, EE and Virgin Media was kicked off in the wake of the TalkTalk hack, which saw the personal details of 157,000 of its customers exposed. More than 15,600 bank account number and sort codes were stolen. Similar problems to those encountered by TalkTalk could have been experienced by any of the major ISPs, Mr Moore believes. \"There have been a couple of incidents where I had to contact ISPs to report things that were serious,\" he told the BBC. The audit found a variety of problems, including passwords stored in plain text, exposed code that would allow hackers to inject their own code on to ISPs' websites and, potentially load malware on to them, and issues with encryption certificates that meant Mr Moore could apply for them from the certificate authority and pose as the webmaster for a set of ISP-owned websites. Mr Moore said he was impressed by most of the ISPs's responses when he raised the issues with them. \"Ordinarily they would not be so open and honest with me but, after what happened at TalkTalk, they have been stepping in quickly,\" said Mr Moore. \"On one occasion I notified BT and PlusNet about a bug at 14:00 and they kept people back until 22:00 to fix it.\" But, he added, TalkTalk was yet to contact him. TalkTalk did supply a statement to the BBC saying it had \"integrated Paul Moore's comments into an ongoing programme of work\". \"We constantly run vulnerability checks using industry-standard third party tools. The vulnerability exploited by the hackers was not picked up by this testing, and if it had been, we would clearly have acted on that information straightaway to secure our system,\" it added. Sky told the BBC: \"We take our customers' security very seriously. We constantly review our systems and we have robust, independently assessed protocols in place to make sure customer information is as secure as possible.\" Prof Alan Woodward, a security expert at Surrey University, said he was shocked by the findings. \"TalkTalk still has problems and others have not dissimilar ones,\" he said. \"I find it very surprising that after the TalkTalk hack, they [the six ISPs] still appear not to be attending to the basics. He added: \"ISPs are the single biggest handlers of our personal data and I would expect them to get this right.\"",

        "article": "A \"national crisis\" in teacher numbers is looming, six unions representing teachers and school leaders in England and Wales have warned. Government limits to teachers' pay and \"real terms cuts\" to school budgets risk undermining standards, they warn. \"Teachers need a pay rise,\" they urge, in a joint statement to the School Teachers' Review Body (STRB), which sets their pay. The government said it was attracting \"the best and brightest\" to teaching. Teachers' pay increases have been limited to 1% or less for the past five years, and the government aims to keep to this limit for the next four years. With long, hard working hours and a relatively low starting salary for a graduate, it is hardly surprising that teacher recruitment is struggling. Qualified teachers in England can expect to start on \u00c2\u00a322,000 outside London or \u00c2\u00a327,000 in inner London. In most cases, this is after post-graduate training, a year's school placement and a degree course. And although there is room for growth and progression - based on performance of course - many newly-qualified teachers find the pressures of the job too much and leave soon after taking their first post. Teachers in England have some of the longest hours and largest classes in the developed world, says the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Teaching unions have complained that although their staff were promised a 1% pay rise, this has had to be found from within existing school budgets. Head teachers say school budgets are already at breaking point as they struggle to deal with other inflationary pressures. But the DfE maintains new trainees can benefit from financial support, a good salary, enviable job security and a generous pension. In October, England's education secretary, Nicky Morgan, wrote to the STRB to remind them of this policy. But the joint statement warns that \"as pay and prospects improve in comparable occupations\", further pressure will be placed on teacher recruitment and retention. This means more children will be taught by teachers who are not specialist in the subjects they teach, it adds. With budgets \"at breaking point\", schools will struggle to maintain current spending - \"let alone afford pay increases\", it continues. \"The government must fully fund the necessary pay increases for teachers and school leaders in both England and Wales.\" The six unions are: Brian Lightman, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, described four more years of pay austerity as a \"false economy\". Kevin Courtney, deputy general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said teachers \"are already leaving in droves and new graduates looking elsewhere for a career\". Mary Bousted, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, claimed 160,000 more teachers would be needed over three years to cope with a rapid increase in pupil numbers. But she warned unless the picture improved the government would have little chance of meeting this target. \"Schools will have to start increasing class sizes or shutting courses and cutting the subject options available to pupils\". And Elaine Edwards, UCAC's general secretary urged the government to reconsider its pay policies \"for the sake of our children and young people and the education system as a whole\". The STRB is expected to make its recommendations on teachers' pay in April. A Department for Education spokeswoman said it had worked with the profession to \"raise the status of teaching\", adding that that a record number of highly-qualified graduates and \"experienced career changers\" were now teaching. She added: \"But we are determined to go further, and recognise that some schools find it harder to recruit the teachers they need, which is why we are expanding the great Teach First and Schools Direct programmes and we are launching the National Teaching Service, which will mean more great teachers in schools in every corner of the country.\"",

        "article": "The new Glasgow School of Art building is being officially opened across the road from Charles Rennie Mackintosh's masterpiece. The Reid Building sits facing Rennie Mackintosh's famous 1909 landmark. Designed by US architect Steven Holl, the new \u00c2\u00a330m building - which is part of a \u00c2\u00a350m project - replaces a 1970s concrete tower block. It will bring the departments of design together under one roof, along with a new lecture theatre, workshops, canteen and staff offices. Charles Rennie Mackintosh was a 28-year-old junior draughtsman at a Glasgow architecture firm when he drew up the designs for the building that many consider his masterpiece. The dramatic art nouveau design of the Glasgow School of Art building in the Garnethill area of the city centre took another 12 years to be completed, finally opening in 1909, but it heralded the birth of a new style in 20th Century European architecture. It is now considered one of Scotland's most admired and influential buildings and Mackintosh, under-appreciated in his own time, is lauded as one of the country's finest designers. The task of designing a 21st Century building to sit on the opposite side of Renfrew Street to Rennie Mackintosh's masterpiece went to Steven Holl, along with local practice JM Architects. Its design has proved controversial, with The Architectural Heritage Society for Scotland branding it \"alien\" and questioning the \"use of large unrelieved stretches of grey opaque glass\". New York-based Holl, 66, won the 2010 competition to design new 11,000 sq ft accommodation for the art school's design department. The building, which will house about 800 students, is named in honour of the art school's former director, Seona Reid. It extends for the same length as its illustrious neighbour, so the temptation to compare them is very great. Holl has described his approach as \"complementary contrast\". He said he wanted to do the opposite of everything Mackintosh did. Whereas Mackintosh has thick sandstone, Holl has developed a thin skin entirely of glass, which he hopes will pick up the light. Mackintosh worked with detail and ornament and Holl uses modern techniques of glass-making. Inside studios and social spaces have large areas of unobstructed window. As well as that, translucent glass has been extended over all external walls and forms a second layer to a number of windows. Famous Glasgow School of Art graduates includes Dr Who actor Peter Capaldi and Harry Potter actor Robbie Coltrane, as well as novelist and muralist Alasdair Gray. Artist Peter Howson and Scotland's national poet Liz Lochhead attended the school as well as Fran Healy and Dougie Payne from Glasgow band Travis and members of Franz Ferdinand. In recent years, Glasgow School of Art has produced many of the UK's leading contemporary artists such as Douglas Gordon and David Shrigley and three recent Turner Prize winners: Simon Starling in 2005, Richard Wright in 2009 and Martin Boyce in 2011.",

The 96-year-old announced his retirement in May, after decades of supporting the Queen, as well as attending events for his own charities and organisations. Prince Philip is also known as the Duke of Edinburgh, but who is he and why is he so important? The Duke of Edinburgh is the Queen's husband - they've been married for nearly 70 years. They met while Prince Philip was an officer in the Navy during World War Two. He and the Queen have four children: Prince Charles, Prince Andrew, Prince Edward and Princess Anne. Prince Philip is also the grandfather of Princes William and Harry, and the great-grandfather of Prince George and Princess Charlotte. Although he isn't the king, his job title is pretty special. He's the Queen's 'consort' - and his role is to support Queen Elizabeth II. He now holds the record for the longest-serving consort in British history! Prince Philip was born in 1921 on the Greek island of Corfu. His family left Greece when Philip was just a one-year-old baby. He spent his childhood in France, Germany and then here in Britain. He celebrated his 96th birthday in June 2017. Philip gave up his job in the Navy after Queen Elizabeth II's father died and she became Queen. He has always thrown himself into his role of supporting her and has found a real passion in doing charity work. One issue he cares about a lot is wildlife conservation - something he spoke to Newsround about back in 1986. You may also have heard of one of his most important and famous charities: The Duke of Edinburgh Award scheme. It offers challenges and adventure to thousands of young people in the UK. Since the Duke of Edinburgh's Award was launched in 1956, millions of young people have taken part in the scheme. Philip also has a reputation for speaking his mind, and sometimes his comments have caused some people embarrassment. However, he is also praised by many for his dedication and his unique way of doing things. The Queen is not only the head of state of the UK but she's also Head of the Commonwealth - an association of 52 countries, many of which used to be part of the British Empire. As well as visiting parts of the UK, part of the Queen's job involves visiting these other countries, meeting people and doing lots of charity work, which Prince Philip often helps her with. Since 1952, Prince Philip has completed 22,219 royal engagements on his own. Every year the Royal Family carry out over 2,000 official visits throughout the UK and worldwide. As the Queen and the Duke have become older more of these royal duties have been passed to the younger members of the family.

The visitors took the lead when a clever dummy from the impressive Oscar Dorley set up Maksim Maksimov to net. Defender Joe Shaughnessy headed home Liam Craig's corner to level but Trakai responded with a stunning long-range strike from Vaidotas Silenas. Craig and Graham Cummins wasted chances as Saints failed to find an equaliser. Trakai finished with 10 men as Silenas picked up a second yellow card with eight minutes left, but the visitors held on. St Johnstone made a positive start but Trakai carved out the first opening in the seventh minute. A cross found Aliaksandr Bychanok, but his diving header went wide. The Lithuanian side looked technically accomplished with 18-year-old Liberian Dorley causing Saints plenty of problems, and the visitors took the lead with a fine move in the 14th minute. A low cross into the box found Maksimov, who fired smartly past Zander Clark. The hosts should have equalised when Blair Alston broke through the centre of the FK Trakai defence but he fired straight at the keeper. The rebound fell to Cummins, who had his first shot blocked before blazing his second over the bar. Richard Foster's shot was diverted wide by Arunas Klimavicius, and from the resultant corner St Johnstone equalised, Shaughnessy heading home from close range into the corner. But the joy for the home fans was short-lived as FK Trakai took the lead for a second time. A fantastic strike from Silenas from range flashed past Clark. The noise levels inside McDiarmid Park dipped once more. At the start of the second half Dorley played in Alma Wakili down the left hand side but he fired his shot well wide of the post. Saints manager Tommy Wright brought on new signing Stefan Scougall in the hope of improving the levels of creativity from the home side. His ball from the flank presented Craig with a great chance to equalise, but the midfielder volleyed his shot high over the crossbar. Then an even better chance. From a poor Saints corner the ball fell fortuitously to the feet of Scougall. He lashed in a low shot which beat the keeper, but struck the post. FK Trakai remained a danger, Clark saving well from Maksimov, but St Johnstone had further opportunities. Alston burst through from midfield and engineered a chance at the edge of the box, but his shot was deflected wide. From the resultant corner Saints had the ball in the net from another Shaughnessy header, but the referee blew his whistle for a foul on the keeper. Silenas was sent off for a second bookable offence, but the home side could not capitalise. Alston again created an opening and as the ball flashed across goal, it fell straight to Cummins, but from five yards out the striker's shot was too close to Trakai keeper Ignas Plukas, who blocked the ball with his trailing foot. St Johnstone boss Tommy Wright: \"Obviously, the result is disappointing. The second goal is criminal from us. It was a great finish but the ball should never get to him. \"We were sloppy at times in possession but I thought we created enough chances to get back in the game. But we probably didn't do enough over the 90 minutes. \"Every one of the teams in this competition are all probably technically better than us, that's why we can't allow them time on the ball. We didn't get in about them enough in the first half. \"We will have to be better in the second leg and I think we will be better.

The Richmond Park and North Kingston MP said he was \"honoured\" after winning 70% of the 9,227 votes cast using an online primary system. He beat London Assembly Member Andrew Boff, MEP Syed Kamall and London's deputy mayor for crime and policing Stephen Greenhalgh. Mr Goldsmith's main rival is likely to be Labour's Sadiq Khan. Mr Khan beat former cabinet minister Tessa Jowell and a number of other current MPs to win the Labour nomination last month. Caroline Pidgeon is the Lib Dem candidate, Sian Berry will contest the election for the Greens and UKIP has chosen its culture spokesman Peter Whittle. Former Respect MP George Galloway is also running. Mr Goldsmith, who was the favourite for the Tory nomination, balloted his constituents earlier this year to seek permission to stand. At the very point of his entry into the race for London mayor, Zac Goldsmith's decision revealed two big characteristics. Only a politician with an acute sense of accountability would have sought permission to stand through a ballot of his constituency members in Richmond and North Kingston. Only someone with his personal wealth would have been able to afford the estimated \u00c2\u00a360,000 cost of doing it. Both characteristics could come to feature heavily in the months to come. Read the whole article He won Friday's vote comfortably, getting 6,514 votes, more than the other three candidates combined. Syed Kamall came second with 1,477 votes ahead of Stephen Greenhalgh (864) and Andrew Boff (372). Mr Goldsmith - who first entered Parliament in 2010 - told the BBC's Daily Politics that he hoped his environmental record would appeal to Green and Lib Dem voters and he also hoped to \"reach out\" to UKIP supporters frustrated with politics as usual and the UK's relationship with the EU. Mr Goldsmith, who has confirmed he would stand down from Parliament if he became mayor, triggering a by-election, said he wanted to build on current mayor Boris Johnson's achievements. But he said anyone who attempted to replicate Mr Johnson's style of leadership would be \"deluded\" as he was a \"unique figure\" in British politics. \"If people are in the market for a 'Boris mark two' are going to be very disappointed,\" he said, adding that people wanted someone who \"will bend George Osborne's ear and get a good deal for London\". He also told the BBC News Channel that high-polluting vehicles should be \"phased out\" of the capital's streets and that his biggest priority would be housing. Both Mr Khan and Mr Goldsmith oppose a new runway at Heathrow airport, a fact described by the British Chambers of Commerce as \"depressing\". Mr Goldsmith is also promising more transport investment to prevent London \"grinding to a halt\" and to \"protect, enhance and improve access\" to green spaces. Current mayor Boris Johnson will step down next year after two terms in office. He is also currently the MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip, having been returned to Parliament in May. Some Conservatives have called for an inquiry into the mayoral election process after only 9,227 people voted - compared with a 87,884 turnout for the Labour contest. In an attempt to open up the contest to people who weren't Conservative members, anyone on the electoral roll was able register to vote for \u00c2\u00a31. But one of the campaign teams told the BBC earlier this month the process \"looked chaotic\". Speaking on the BBC's Daily Politics, Mr Galloway dismissed Mr Goldsmith as a \"Great Gatsby figure\" who could not relate to most Londoners' lives and Mr Khan as \"a very boring man\". He revealed policies including compulsorily purchasing any house left vacant for more than a year and having 50% of all homes in the capital as social housing.",

The Department for Transport said up to 60 trains, capable of speeds of about 225mph, were needed. The contract, which will also involve maintaining the fleet, will be awarded in 2019. The trains are for the first phase of the project, due to open in 2026 and run between London and Birmingham. Construction will begin later this year and it is expected to reduce rail times between Birmingham and London by 32 minutes. A second Y-shaped phase of HS2 will open in two stages. The line from Birmingham to Crewe will launch in 2027, with the remaining construction - which includes a spur taking HS2 to a new station at Manchester Airport - due to finish six years later. There will be separate contracts in the future to supply trains for this phase. Transport secretary Chris Grayling said the new railway would carry more than 300,000 people a day. \"Hundreds of jobs will be created in building and maintaining these trains, representing a great opportunity for British-based businesses and suppliers. \"In total 25,000 jobs and 2,000 apprenticeships will be created during HS2 construction and we have held discussions with UK suppliers to make sure they are in the best possible position to win contracts,\" he added. Friday's launch comes ahead of a formal start of the process in spring 2017, when companies interested in bidding can learn more about the process. Formal invitations to tender will be made in 2018. Hitachi Rail Europe said it will bid for the contract to build the HS2 trains. The rail manufacturer is headquartered in London and builds trains at its plant in Newton Aycliffe in County Durham. Its sales director, Nick Hughes, said: \"Our HS2 trains would be built in Britain, for Britain, and combine world-leading Japanese Shinkansen technology with British manufacturing know-how.\" Gordon Wakeford, managing director of Siemens Mobility, said a manufacturing contract of this scale  was \"exciting news\" for the rail industry and would have a \"positive impact on the wider UK supply chain\".

Scottish FA regulations prohibit players from betting on any football. Annan Athletic chairman Henry McClelland and Inverness player Lewis Horner were this week charged by the national body with gambling offences. \"We have to have an adult conversation regarding a number of issues relating to gambling,\" Wishart said. \"The effectiveness of the rule when people are still gambling, is it fit for purpose in the modern day, why are individuals still gambling, are there financial problems, mental health problems, addictions behind the scenes? \"Since the rule was brought into place, there's been nobody charged with spot-fixing or match-fixing, which is very, very important, and therefore the game perhaps is suffering from poor headlines and I don't think the situation at the moment is helping the image of Scottish football.\" Wishart admits he is uncertain whether the existing regulations are adequate, and reiterates his belief that Scottish football's authorities must join forces to tackle the problem. \"Sometimes I move from one side to the other,\" Wishart told BBC Scotland of his appraisal of the rules. \"I can absolutely see why the rule is in place, because we want to stop and discourage people from spot or match-fixing. And that was the original purpose of the regulation. \"But since then, [the Scottish FA] have brought in a specific regulation that addresses spot and match-fixing, and has much, much heavier sanctions. If we sit in Scottish football as stakeholders and don't do anything, don't address or discuss the issues then I don't think we're doing our jobs. \"Because at the moment player after player, perhaps betting on games across Europe, now we've got a chairman and we may have others as well, traipsing up the steps at Hampden to massive negative headlines, and I don't think it's doing our game any good. I would just call for a proper and adult discussion on all these issues.\" PFA Scotland's chairman, former Dundee United midfielder John Rankin, told BBC Scotland in April that gambling is \"rife\" throughout Scottish football. Ex-Inverness player Barry Wilson believes there should be an amnesty for players regarding historical bets - a suggestion Wishart says should be considered. \"Certainly, we should be looking at and considering an amnesty,\" Wishart added. \"There are a number of people who have been charged for what are ostensibly historical issues going back a number of years when perhaps they weren't aware on the rules. \"So I thought perhaps an amnesty would give us a start from zero, and then with a renewed education programme we cam move on from there. \"We're trying to address the issue and the individual.

        "article": "A surprise new name has emerged as a potential successor to long-standing McLaren boss Ron Dennis, whose position as chairman is under threat. Leading F1 commercial figure Zak Brown has been contacted by McLaren as the company seeks a replacement. Dennis has been told by the two parties that own 75% of McLaren Group that his contract will not be renewed for 2017. But Brown, a 44-year-old American, is also considered a potential chief commercial officer for F1's new owners. The US media group Liberty is in the process of buying a controlling interest in the sport's commercial arm from investment group CVC Capital Partners. The deal is expected to be completed early next year. Brown is of particular interest to McLaren because of his success in finding new sponsors for a number of teams on the grid in his former role as boss of the marketing agency JMI, from which he resigned in September. McLaren have not had a title sponsor since parting company with mobile phone company Vodafone at the end of 2013. Ironically, McLaren have had a major success in recent weeks in securing a new partnership deal for BP/Castrol to become their fuel and lubricant supplier. The deal has been signed but has not yet been announced. The company will replace Exxon Mobil, which has been poached by Red Bull for next season after 21 years with McLaren. That deal is expected to be announced imminently. The three names revealed by BBC Sport over the US Grand Prix weekend - ex-F1 team bosses Ross Brawn, Martin Whitmarsh and former Sainsbury's boss Justin King - remain of interest to McLaren and have been contacted by the team. But all three are now considered unlikely to take on the position. They may be unwilling to put themselves forward or it may be decided they are not the best person for the role. It is also possible Dennis, who is chairman and chief executive officer and has been in charge at McLaren for 35 years, would be replaced by two different people, as would be a more conventional company structure. Brown is friendly with all the main shareholders at McLaren, including Dennis. But BBC Sport understands that the Bahrainis and Ojjeh are now reaching out to him as they seek a new man to run the company. If McLaren can persuade him to take the role, it would be something of a coup for the team, since it has long been known that Brown has been favourite for the commercial head of F1 job at Liberty Media. Despite the ultimatum by his fellow shareholders, Dennis has been telling friends and confidants that he will decide when or if he will step down, not anyone else. But it is far from clear that he is in a position to make that decision. If his contract is not renewed, he would remain a 25% shareholder but would probably have no active role or power in running the company. Dennis will fight hard to retain his position as the head of McLaren, despite the fracturing of relationships between him on the one hand and Ojjeh and the Bahrainis on the other. He has run the company since 1981 and has become synonymous with McLaren, which he has built up into one of the sport's most successful teams, as well as launching a road-car company that sells high-end supercars. Dennis had been trying to find investment to enable him to buy a controlling shareholding in McLaren Group. He did have an agreement with Ojjeh and Mumtalakat that he could buy sufficient shares to take him over over 50% were he to find that investment. Dennis found two separate Chinese groups of investors. One was on the verge of completing a deal with Dennis before a weakening of the Chinese economy caused the arrangement to collapse. He then sourced a second group of Chinese investors and took them to Ojjeh and Mumtalkat, who refused to sell their shares because they did not want to grant Dennis so much power in the company.",

The move was confirmed during a backbench debate on the row over Carol Mills' choice as preferred candidate. Commons Speaker John Bercow decided recently to pause the process amid MPs' concerns about her suitability. Mr Straw told MPs that it was \"imperative\" that the future status and remit of the job was agreed upon. The clerk of the House is the principal constitutional adviser to the Commons, and adviser on all its procedure and business. Paid \u00c2\u00a3200,000 a year, he or she is also responsible for the overall administration of the House of Commons, including the signing of leases, contracts and public expenditure on Commons services. MPs have questioned the selection of Carol Mills - who works in the Australian Parliament - to replace the former Clerk Sir Robert Rogers, who retired in July. Speaking in a debate in the Commons, Jesse Norman - who has led opposition to the appointment - said disquiet over the job raised wider questions about how the Commons governed itself. \"This debate arises because of a widespread concern among colleagues across the House that the appointment process for the next clerk of this House was seriously flawed,\" he said. Mr Norman said the new committee - which will report early next year - would examine the question of whether the procedural and management roles of the Clerk should be divided between different officials. Mr Bercow, who headed the panel which originally chose Ms Mills but was not in the chair for Wednesday's debate, has said the proposal has merit and should be considered by MPs. Confirming his involvement, Mr Straw said the committee would look into the case for separating the roles and how that might work in practice and make a series of recommendations. However, he expressed concern that the committee was having to complete its work in nine weeks. Ex-Commons leader Andrew Lansley - who sat on the original selection panel - said he believed the appointment was mistaken and accused Mr Bercow of seeking to \"water down\" the requirement in the job description that the Clerk should have \"detailed knowledge of the procedures and practices of the House\". He said he believed the entire appointment process should be abandoned and a clerk appointed on a temporary basis until the House reached agreement on the future of the role. But Labour MP Barry Sheerman said critics of the appointment had a \"secret agenda\", which amounted to wanting to \"have a go at the Speaker\". And Tory MP Philip Davies said colleagues of his who were using the row as a \"Trojan Horse for a personal vendetta\" against Mr Bercow looked \"absolutely ridiculous\". For the government, deputy Commons leader Tom Brake said it was \"entirely proper\" for the committee to look into the matter, saying the terms of the review was an issue for MPs, not ministers. But he said it was important that it should be done in a \"timely manner\" and that the public should know which Commons officials were accountable for the \"substantial challenges\" the House faced.",

The Dutch firm said the 26.9bn euro (\u00c2\u00a322.8bn) offer undervalued Akzo and showed a \"lack of cultural understanding of the brand\". The company, which claims its own plans for growth are superior, has been urged to reject a merger by the Dutch government and its own workers. But some Akzo investors favour a deal. PPG said it was disappointed by Akzo Nobel's decision and would \"review\" the firm's response. It comes several weeks after PPG increased its offer to buy the Amsterdam-based firm for the second time as it seeks to create an industry leader in the paints and coatings sector. The US firm suggested the bid was its last friendly attempt to merge with Akzo and has not ruled out putting the matter directly to shareholders. But responding on Monday, Akzo chief executive Ton Buchner said his team had conducted an \"extensive review\" of the bid and had again found it wanting. \"The PPG proposal undervalues AkzoNobel, contains significant risks and uncertainties, makes no substantive commitments to stakeholders and demonstrates a lack of cultural understanding,\" he said. Akzo says its own plans for the firm - which involve spinning off its chemicals division into a separate business - would better serve shareholders. It has promised to increase its dividend for 2017 by half and pay a 1bn euro special cash dividend in November. However, it also faces mounting pressure from some of its biggest shareholders to consider a deal, having repeatedly refused to enter talks with PPG's management.

In its favour, Akzo has won political support against a tie-up, with four provincial governments having warned of its impact on jobs.

        "article": "A 19-year-old man has been jailed for life for planning a bomb attack that may have targeted an Elton John concert or Oxford Street in central London. Haroon Syed, of west London, admitted preparing acts of terrorism after trying to source weapons including a suicide bomb and machine gun. He was caught after approaching MI5 officers, who were posing as a fellow extremist, via social media. Syed was sentenced to a minimum of 16 years and six months. Last year, his brother was jailed for life for plotting to behead someone on Remembrance Sunday. Judge Michael Topolski QC said Syed wanted to carry out \"an act of mass murder\" and therefore a discretionary life sentence was warranted. Prosecutors say Syed's plans ranged from becoming a suicide bomber to staging a gun attack, and while he initially boasted of working with others, those people did not materialise. Instead, over the summer of last year, he made increasingly urgent efforts to secure weaponry. After he went online looking for help, a purported jihadist fighting overseas, known only as Abu Isa, introduced him to another extremist going by the name Abu Yusuf. This second man was, in fact, a group of MI5 officers who were playing the role of a jihadist in what became weeks of social media chat with Syed. Teen admits planning 'London bomb attack' Duncan Penny QC, prosecuting, told the Old Bailey there was initially some \"suspicion on both sides\" before Abu Yusuf concluded that Syed was a \"committed brother\" he could deal with. Syed then began talking about his aspirations and gave his contact a shopping list, saying he wanted \"do martyrdom\" after first causing \"damage\" with a machine gun. \"Can you get the gear?\" asked Syed. \"You will be involved right? \"Two things. Number one, machine gun and we need someone who can make a vest you know the dugma [button] one. So after some damage with machine gun then do itishadi [martyrdom] ... that's what I'm planning to do.\" The undercover officer told Syed guns were expensive - but he might be able to get someone to build a bomb. Syed floated the idea of going to fight overseas with his new-found friend - but revealed his passport had been cancelled by the authorities. He tried and failed twice to get fraudulent loans of thousands of pounds to cover the cost of firearms - and eventually agreed to meet his contact in a coffee shop in Slough, Berkshire, to finalise an alternative plan. Over two meetings, he talked about his aspirations and then handed over \u00c2\u00a3150, asking for a bomb packed with nails. The conversation was secretly recorded. \"I was thinking of Oxford Street,\" he told his contact. \"If you put those things inside called nails, do you know what that is, nails? Those sharp things - lots of them inside. \"Good man, can't wait akhi [brother]. If I go to prison, I go to prison. If I die, I die, you understand? I have got to get to Jannah [heaven].\" The undercover officer later told Syed a \"bomb-making brother\" would have the device ready within days - and the suspect went online to narrow his list of targets. His web searches included \"packed places in London\" and \"Elton John, Hyde Park, 11 September\" - a major concert hosted by BBC Radio 2 which also featured Status Quo and Madness. Prosecutors say Syed's character had begun to change outwardly in late 2014, coinciding with the growing support among British extremists for the self-styled Islamic State group. During the course of the investigation, detectives found his web searches jumped about as he tried to satisfy himself that an attack on civilians was theologically justifiable. One of his last searches, a week before his arrest, was: \"How can I stop being upset about the UK killing innocent Syrians and get on with my day?\" When counter-terrorist detectives arrested him in September and asked him for the password for his phone, he replied: \"ISIS - you like that?\" Syed's was one of 18 terror plots to have been foiled since 2013. Mitigating, Mark Summers QC said it was a \"crude, ill-thought-out\" plan made at the behest of others. The court heard Syed had fallen under the influence of members of banned extremist group Al-Muhajiroun, and that he now publicly rejected his past beliefs and condemned the recent bomb attack in Manchester. But Judge Topolski told Syed: \"You were not lured, you were not enticed, you were not entrapped. \"You became, and in my judgement as shown by your online activities away from your contact with Abu Yusuf, deeply committed to the ideology of a brutal and barbaric organisation that sought to hijack and corrupt an ancient and venerable religion for its own purposes and you wanted to be part of it.\" Deb Walsh, deputy head of the counter-terrorism division of the Crown Prosecution Service, said: \"Haroon Syed is clearly a danger to the public who was prepared to carry out indiscriminate attacks against innocent people. \"The compelling evidence presented by the CPS left him with no choice but to plead guilty.\"",

The aid package, worth 500m euros (\u00a3365m), was announced at a meeting of EU farm ministers in Brussels. It is understood the bulk of the money will be used to support the dairy sector in the various member countries. But there will be no increase in the milk intervention price, a key demand of Northern Ireland's dairy industry. It is the price at which Europe buys milk and milk powders to shore up the market and currently stands at about 16 to 17p. The commission said raising the price was not the \"appropriate policy\" and would not solve the current market problem. It added that it would create an \"artificial outlet\" for EU dairy products, pushing market prices further down. The commission's aid package is intended to help farmers' cash flow problems and stabilise agricultural markets. However, DUP MEP Diane Dodds said it \"falls well short\" of what is needed. She called on EU Agriculture Commissioner Phil Hogan to rethink and do more, especially on the milk intervention price. Agriculture Minister Michelle O'Neill said:  \"We have thousands of farmers on the streets of Brussels here today waiting for answers and waiting for a glimmer of hope in terms of what support they're going to achieve. \"That information still isn't clear at this minute in time.\" During the talks, thousands of European farmers held protests near the EU headquarters over falling farm produce prices and many blocked streets with tractors. Representatives of Northern Ireland's farming industry were among those attending the demonstrations, 23 of them from the UFU. In the meeting, the commission said it would give member states the flexibility to advance up to 70% of direct subsidy payments to farmers and 85% of rural development payments from 16 October. They are normally paid in December. The commission said it would allow for flexibility about the checks normally done before payment. However, the UFU questioned whether, given the complexity of checks under the new Common Agricultural Policy payment system, farmers would get their money any earlier. The aid package includes new private storage schemes for dairy protein products and pigmeat; an attempt to remove trade barriers in non-EU countries and more missions to non-EU countries in an attempt to open new markets. Farmers have been under pressure for some time, due in part to a Russian ban on EU food imposed in response to EU sanctions over Ukraine. A slowdown in the Chinese economy and the shrinking of markets in some oil producing countries has also had an impact. Northern Ireland's farmers have the complication of a weak euro, making their exports to the Eurozone more expensive. In the dairy sector, 85% of milk produced in Northern Ireland is destined for the export market. Latest figures show that in July, farmers in Northern Ireland got 18.87p a litre for milk - about 10p a litre below production cost.",

        "article": "Partick Thistle will finish in the Scottish Premiership's top six for the first time after beating Motherwell, who slipped to second bottom. Chris Erskine crossed low for Kris Doolan to tap home and give the Jags an early lead. Adam Barton and Steven Lawless came close to doubling the hosts' advantage. After a poor first half Well carved out chances to score in the second, Zak Jules's header kept out by goalkeeper Tomas Cerny. Media playback is not supported on this device With one more round of fixtures to play before the Premiership splits in two, Thistle have a seven-point gap over Kilmarnock and will face Celtic, Aberdeen, Rangers, St Johnstone and Hearts in the final few weeks of the season. Before then, they will visit Rangers next weekend, when Motherwell host basement side Inverness Caledonian Thistle. Having come from a goal down to beat Ross County last week and drawing away to champions Celtic on Wednesday, Thistle's confidence was high and they were in a hurry to make that count. Doolan scored both goals against County - his 100th and 101st for the Jags - and the striker marked being captain for the day with a simple finish off Erskine's ball across from the left. Barton's free-kick drifted narrowly past the left-hand post and Lawless's shot was deflected on to the crossbar. And Doolan should have got Thistle's second following an incisive pass by Ryan Edwards, the striker firing across the face of goal from the right of the six-yard box. Other than an early Scott McDonald header that was blocked out for a corner, Motherwell failed to seriously trouble their hosts in the opening period. Manager Stephen Robinson needed a reaction in the second half and sent on Keith Lasley and Lionel Ainsworth in place of Elliott Frear and Craig Clay. Shea Gordon flashed the ball across goal but the stretching McDonald could not apply the finish, Cerny clawed away Jules's header and Lasley's effort did not trouble the Jags goalkeeper. A late scramble in the box did not provide the telling shot at goal the visitors needed as Thistle held on, leaving Motherwell four points above Inverness and below Lanarkshire rivals Hamilton Academical on goal difference. Lawless dragged a shot wide after driving at the Well defence but Alan Archibald's side struggled to create as many openings in the second half. But one goal proved to be enough to ensure they will claim their highest top-flight finish since 1981. They had been bottom of the division in December, a couple of months after Archibald stayed at the club following an approach by Shrewsbury Town. He will now have the chance to get Thistle even higher in the Premiership with only three points separating the Jags from Hearts. Match ends, Partick Thistle 1, Motherwell 0.

        "article": "Astronomers have identified the most distant object yet in the Solar System. Observations with Japan's Subaru telescope reveal the likely icy body to be some 15.5 billion km from the Sun - about three times further away than even far-flung Pluto. Scientists say their initial studies suggest that the object - catalogued as  V774104 - is some 500-1,000km across. It will need to be tracked over time to learn the shape and extent of its orbit through the Solar System. The discovery was announced at the 47th annual meeting of the American Astronomical Society's Division for Planetary Sciences, taking place in National Harbor near Washington DC. The team behind the find is led by Scott Sheppard, from the Carnegie Institution for Science, and Chad Trujillo, from the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii. They specialise in detecting Solar System outliers. The previously recognised most distant object is the dwarf planet Eris. This body, which has a moon, Dysnomia, moves between 5.7 billion km and 14.6 billion km from the Sun. To put some of these numbers in context: Earth is 149 million km from the Sun, and even the most distant major planet - Neptune - seems close at 4.5 billion km, by these standards. That said, the Voyager 1 probe is further away - just. The epic robotic explorer has now ventured 20 billion km from home. The big question is whether V774104 sweeps inwards from its present location, like Eris, or outwards, like the objects known as 2012 VP113 and Sedna. These bodies are currently slightly closer in than Eris, but investigations of their orbits show they will reach far deeper into space, out to 66 billion km and 140 billion km, respectively. Models for Solar System formation suggest that such objects were probably not created in these weird, eccentric orbits. One explanation is that they have been perturbed gravitationally and pulled on to their strange trajectories by a passing planet - perhaps one that was expelled from our Solar System early in its history. Some scientists even speculate that such objects could have been stolen from a star that formed from the same \"nursery\" of gas and dust as our Sun 4.6 billion years ago.

        "article": "So, is Northern Ireland better off inside or outside the European Union? The Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader Colum Eastwood, who visited Brussels this week, is in no doubt. He described the prospect of the UK's withdrawal from Europe as \"the biggest immediate threat to the economy of Northern Ireland and to the island as a whole\". He insisted a Brexit - the inelegant shorthand for Britain leaving Europe - \"would undermine and destabilise the fabric of successive Anglo-Irish agreements\". It would \"undermine and destabilise our north-south institutions\", he added, and would \"resurrect borders and resurrect barriers for business\". In Northern Ireland Questions in the House of Commons, the Democratic Unionist Party's (DUP) Sammy Wilson took the opposite view. He maintained a vote to leave the EU would \"help the Northern Ireland economy insofar as it would release \u00a318bn every year for expenditure on public services\". He also said it would \"enable us to enter a trade agreement with growing parts of the world and release us from the stifling bureaucracies of Europe\". Finance Minister Mervyn Storey, Mr Wilson's DUP colleague, attended an event this week to welcome the allocation of more than \u00a3400m in EU peace and cross-border funding for Northern Ireland. Earlier this month, Emma Pengelly, another DUP minister, described the peace money and the European Task Force on Northern Ireland as \"essential to making Northern Ireland work and building that better future we want to see\". At the same time, DUP politicians tell you it is only right that Northern Ireland should get its share, pointing out that the UK puts \u00a31.50 into the European pot for every \u00a31 it gets back. In the Commons, the SDLP, the Scottish National Party and the Labour Party appeared to be intent on exposing the difference between what they termed the \"mixed messages\" emanating from the Eurosceptic Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers and Ben Wallace, her Europhile junior minister. When it came to calculating the amount Britain puts into Europe, Mr Wilson set the bar high at \u00a318bn. Both the DUP's deputy leader Nigel Dodds and First Minister Arlene Foster recently quoted far more conservative estimates of about \u00a39bn. That, coincidentally, is about the same amount as Northern Ireland's fiscal deficit with Westminster, according to the latest Stormont budget. This BBC backgrounder opts for a UK EU contribution figure of \u00a311.3bn. Mr Dodds told the BBC's Question Time that Northern Ireland and the UK could survive quite well outside the EU. Both he and Mrs Foster are sticking to the official DUP line that they will not make their minds up definitively until Prime Minister David Cameron has completed his negotiations for EU reform. But given Mr Wilson's belief that Mr Cameron's renegotiation is doomed to fail, and the DUP MEP Diane Dodds' previous criticism of the prime minister's \"barrenness of ambition\", it appears almost certain that the DUP will end up campaigning for EU withdrawal, together with the Tradional Unionist Voice and the UK Independence Party. The SDLP, Sinn F\u00e9in and the Alliance Party will be in the pro EU camp. The Ulster Unionists are still in wait-and-see mode. If Mr Cameron does opt for a summer referendum, voters in Northern Ireland will barely have time to recover from May's assembly election before they are asked to go to the polls again. The campaign will no doubt feature plenty of financial arguments, not just about the UK's membership fees but also regarding the impact of any withdrawal on future trade between the UK and the rest of the EU. Mrs Foster told me she would like more clarity about Westminster's plans for Northern Ireland's financial subvention in the event of the UK leaving the EU and the consequent loss of peace and cross-border cash. Whether she gets such clarity is doubtful, given that the prime minister may be reluctant to contemplate such a possibility. Away from the numbers game, with the Irish government watching on with concern and nationalists and unionists likely to be polarised, expect plenty of good old-fashioned traditional politics. Sinn F\u00e9in MEP Martina Anderson has said a Brexit \"could see the re-emergence of passport checkpoints and customs controls\" along the Irish border that would hinder \"free movement and disrupt the lives of nearly a million people living in the border region\". Mrs Foster said that is \"scaremongering\" and appears convinced that \"practical solutions\" will mean cross-border trade and the free movement of people would continue unaffected. Just like the Scottish independence referendum, the EU campaign in Northern Ireland may ultimately be more about hearts and minds than it is about facts and figures.",

The DUP also believes that the UK's contribution to the EU is \u00a318bn, while the SDLP and other parties suggest a lower figure. The issue is likely to be a topic of debate in the upcoming assembly election and referendum on EU membership.",

Media playback is not supported on this device Shareholders at the meeting called by King, who owns 14.5% of shares in Rangers International Football Club plc, voted Derek Llambias and finance director Barry Leach off the board. King's consortium received about 85% of the votes cast. And the new board has already appointed shareholder Douglas Park as a director. David Somers, who was chairman, and James Easdale had already resigned from the board before the EGM. King addressed fans after being voted on to the board and said the EGM was a \"turning point in the future of the club\". And later, he said: \"We want Rangers to get back to being in its rightful place in Scottish football. Media playback is not supported on this device \"The club is pretty much broken. It's broken in many areas. Pretty much everything has to be looked at. \"There will be other appointments. The fans' groups have been absolutely superb. We think that should be recognised. We want to work with fans in terms of getting representation on the board.\" And Murray added: \"We'll take time to build the board out. We're not involved in short-term fixing.\" Murray also addressed the issue of appointing a new manager. Ally McCoist is on gardening leave after leaving the post late last year and caretaker Kenny McDowall is working his year-long notice period. \"We're laying the foundation for a long-term project here and appointing a first-team manager is a crucial decision,\" said Murray. \"We're going to take some time and get it right.\" Outgoing chief executive Llambias and Leach are associates of Sports Direct and Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley, who was this week fined \u00a37,500 by the Scottish Football Association for breaching rules on dual ownership. Media playback is not supported on this device He has loaned \u00a310m to the club and holds lucrative commercial contracts relating to its business. Llambias and Leach still have executive employment contracts at Rangers. King was confident ahead of the vote that he had enough votes for a simple majority to have the five resolutions passed - two for the removal of Llambias and Leach, who were not present at the meeting, and one each for the appointment of King himself, Murray and Gilligan. And his chances were boosted when it emerged that the bloc of shareholders represented by Sandy Easdale, chairman of the club's football board, abstained from the vote. It was initially thought they would use their combined share of a little more than 20% to vote against the King consortium. Many shareholders had voted by post or by proxy since the EGM was originally due to be held in London. That decision prompted a backlash and the two hotels chosen to host pulled out. King, an ex-pat Glaswegian who lives in South Africa, had appealed for shareholders attending the meeting to act \"with calmness and dignity\". He was applauded as he took his seat in the stand. Rangers will also have to appoint a new nominated advisor - the company that manages Rangers International Football Club's listing on the Alternative Investment Market. The company's previous 'nomad', WH Ireland, resigned ahead of the EGM, which resulted in the shares being suspended. A new nomad must be appointed within 30 days or the company will be de-listed from the Stock Exchange. King has stated Rangers need more than \u00a320m invested in the near future to get the club into a competitive position.

        "article": "The five world champions on the current grid have all secured at least one title in Brazil and on Sunday they could be joined by a sixth - if Nico Rosberg wins the race, team-mate Lewis Hamilton's hopes of an unlikely late-season comeback will be over. First, though, the German has to negotiate one of the most intense weekends of the year. The Brazilian Grand Prix throbs with a passion and fervour matched by few others. Interlagos and Sao Paulo are inextricably linked with Formula 1 even if the days of a winning Brazilian driver may be some time in the past. Brazil's first legendary grand prix driver, Emerson Fittipaldi, was born there, and his successes on the world stage laid the path for all others to follow. Ayrton Senna was, likewise, a Paulista, and is buried in Morumbi cemetery a few miles away. He was a hero to Rubens Barrichello, who grew up metres from the race track and forged his passion watching Senna there, before graduating to F1 a couple of years before his death, befriending him, and then taking up his mantle. Felipe Massa, another local boy, followed suit. The fans know the glory days have long gone, that a Brazilian victory is as unlikely as a day without a traffic jam in one of the world's most crowded cities. But still they come, packing the grandstands and singing and chanting from early in the day. What draws them there? A deep-seated passion for the sport, for one. The almost-certainty of a great sporting spectacle, for another. Interlagos has a knack for producing exciting races. Drama is synonymous with the track, not least because of its position at the business end of the season. It is a claustrophobic place. The circuit winds around a natural amphitheatre, high on a hill, the sprawl of Sao Paulo both a backdrop and crushing in from all sides. The heavy humidity, and almost-permanent threat of rain, add to the atmosphere. It feels locked in, and not just because of the cramped old paddock, a fraction of the size of anything Bernie Ecclestone finds acceptable these days. The track is a splash of vibrant green in an ocean of concrete grey and smog brown; the city butting up against the perimeter fence, endless tower blocks filling the skyline. Twenty years ago, a favela sprawled up the hill all the way to the perimeter wall. There has been an attempt to spruce things up a bit, the old corrugated-roof shacks replaced by flats closest to the circuit, houses of naked breeze blocks a bit further down the road. But down at heel, to say the least, it remains. There is an unmistakable edge. The road up to Interlagos is not a place for a stranger to linger. Inside, the track feels like a haven. One of the shortest laps on the calendar somehow packs in a long straight - superb for overtaking - and a challenging sequence of long corners, the best the uphill double right-hander of Ferra Dura/Laranha and the fast downhill left of Mergulho. It's a great race track, with emphasis on the \"race\". They are corners with a history - the new track is about half of the old one. Part of a previous era, it was a magnificent five miles of twists and turns, uphill and down, which started with two incredible, banked, high-speed left-handers, taken absolutely flat out by some, still visible outside the modern Turns One, Two and Three. It all adds to the character of the place. Loud, intimidating, crazy, invigorating, rough-around-the-edges. But, in its own way, brilliant.

It was one of several measures European and African leaders agreed to reduce the flow of people into Europe. The leaders said their aim was to \"address the root causes of migration\". The Europe-Africa meeting was planned after around 800 migrants died when their boat sank off Libya in April. Senegal's President Macky Sall, who currently heads the West African regional group Ecowas, told journalists on the sidelines of the summit that the money pledged was \"not enough for the whole of Africa\". Later, at the closing press conference, he said he was pleased with the trust fund, but said he would like to see it \"more generously financed\". Niger's President Mahamadou Issoufou echoed the Senegalese president's sentiments and added that \"reform of global governance\" was also needed, to make world trade fairer, Reuters news agency reports. While Somalia's Prime Minister Omar Abdirashidali Sharmatke told the BBC:  \"What Africa needs today is not charity, but investment.\" EU Council President Donald Tusk said the summit had agreed \"a long list of very concrete actions to be implemented by the end of 2016\". These include setting up a joint European and African team in Niger to tackle people smuggling and increasing the number of visas available to students and researchers. \"We are under no illusions that we can improve the situation overnight but we are committed to giving people alternatives to risking their lives,\" Mr Tusk said. The European trust fund is supposed to \"foster stability... and to contribute to better migration management\", according to a European Union statement. It is also aimed at \"promoting economic... opportunities, security and development\" in the 23 African countries named which, along with Senegal, include Nigeria, Eritrea and Libya. The money will be spent on: \"Financial aid to accept deportation of thousands\" declares Algerian daily El-Khabar, before quoting human rights groups warning that Europe was \"forcing African countries to play the role of policeman\". However, Germany's tabloid Bild asks: \"Why is Chancellor Merkel negotiating with Africa's despots?\" in its account of the \"tricky Valletta summit\". Similarly, the Sueddeutsche Zeitung says the EU's offer of money for fewer refugees from Africa was making critics \"accuse the EU of showing its real values by cooperating with unjust regimes\". In neighbouring France, Le Figaro urges President Francois Hollande to \"have the courage\" to drastically cut all kinds of aid for migrants. \"In the short term, what is he waiting for to close the Calais 'jungle'... and change the policy against clandestine immigration?\" In Russia, state-controlled Channel One TV describes the summit as \"another attempt by Europe to stop the chaos\", noting that \"whilst Europe and Africa are bargaining with each other, thousands are embarking on fatal trips in the Mediterranean\". The $1.9bn fund is in addition to the $20bn the EU already spends on development assistance in Africa every year, Mr Tusk said. The fund is also supposed to be boosted by contributions by individual member states, but only a small amount had been pledged. The UN says some 150,000 people from African countries such as Eritrea, Nigeria and Somalia have made the dangerous journey across the Mediterranean. But this has been dwarfed by the arrival of some 650,000 people - mostly Syrians - via Turkey and Greece. There have been more than 3,000 deaths as people try to make the crossing.

        "article": "The UK economy grew by 0.3% in the three months to June, driven in part by a booming film industry, said the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The initial estimate showed growth picking up from the first quarter of the year, when it was 0.2%. The ONS said the growth was driven by services, particularly retail, which more than offset falls in output in the manufacturing and construction sectors. It added there had been a \"notable slowdown\" in growth from last year. However, the figure for the second quarter was in line with economists' expectations. Analysts said the rise in growth was unlikely to change expectations that the Bank of England will keep interest rates at their current record low next week. ONS head of national accounts Darren Morgan said: \"The economy has experienced a notable slowdown in the first half of this year.\" Film production in the UK, plus box-office receipts from cinemas, was one of the best performing parts of the economy during the period. \"While services such as retail, and film production and distribution showed some improvement in the second quarter, a weaker performance from construction and manufacturing pulled down overall growth,\" Mr Morgan said. On Monday, the International Monetary Fund downgraded its forecast for UK economic growth this year because of the weak first-quarter figure. The IMF said it expects UK GDP to grow by 1.7% instead of its previous projection of 2%. Chancellor Philip Hammond said the UK economy had now grown consistently for four-and-a-half years. \"We can be proud of that, but we are not complacent,\" he added. \"We need to focus on restoring productivity growth to deliver higher wages and living standards for people across the country.\" Labour shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: \"Today's GDP figures reveal weak growth under a weak government, and expose the last seven years of Tory economic failure. \"Growth for the first half of 2017 is below expectations, and it follows continued data showing working families are being squeezed with wages not keeping up with prices.\" Aberdeen Asset Management chief economist Lucy O'Carroll said: \"This pick-up will be taken as good news, but it really doesn't amount to much. \"The figures are the first estimate of growth, based on very patchy data. They always get revised over time, and often substantially so. \"It's the underlying trends that matter. They don't look favourable at the moment, given the uncertainties around Brexit and the pressure on household budgets from higher inflation.\"",

        "article": "It is a day when women from Merseyside are encouraged to dress in their finest clothes and enjoy a day at the races at Ladies' Day. Yet the sophisticated image of the Grand National is far removed from the images in newspapers the day after of women falling over, or with underwear showing after being caught by gusts of wind. It is something that Liverpool women academics, stylists and commentators are tired of, and the fight back has begun. Liverpool fashion student Hannah Ramsay, who now lives in London, said that people there regard her accent as something \"hysterically funny\". She wrote a paper on the north-south fashion divide as part of her degree course. \"I think the gap is closing between the north and the south in terms of fashion,\" she said. \"There are always going to be people who want to do Liverpool down and resort to stereotypes no matter what we do, there are people who want to rip it to shreds.\" She said she will not go to Ladies' Day as she does not want to judge other people subconsciously. \"People in Liverpool do want to look good and not adhere to the norm,\" she added. Gemma Ahearne, a sociology and criminology lecturer and PhD student, said the negative coverage is part of the \"vilification of the working classes\", who are \"not regarded as being worthy of being at the races\". She used Aintree as a case study when she examined how the media portrays women and she believes it targets women and defines them as \"Chavs\" who are held up as \"defective\" and to be mocked. Ms Ahearne said: \"I don't go to the National as it's cruel to the horses, but I have friends who go and hate how women are treated and portrayed as caricatures,\" she said. She believes the media are \"misogynistic and disapproving of women who are hyper-confident, and such coverage aims to regulate their behaviour\". \"The comments below the line on these articles are disgusting and you get a differentiation at Cheltenham and Ascot, where the language and semantics talks of fashionable fillies,\" she added. Jennina O'Neill, manager of the Met Quarter shopping district in Liverpool, said it was disappointing the press focus on the same stereotypes year after year. She said: \"It's important to celebrate individuality, but the focus should be on style, it would be nice to see more stories showcasing some of the great looks at the races.\" Interestingly, she does not believe it has a major impact on the city as she said \"every city has to deal with certain stereotypes.\" She agreed that women in Merseyside take pride in their appearance, but said there were lots of different looks in the city. \"One thing we notice from our shoppers is the appetite for individuality\", she added. Andy Heath, the deputy managing director of Merseyrail, said they had seen a marked change in the behaviour of racegoers - for the better - over the last four or five years. \"There is a well-trodden stereotype of Ladies' Day that people turn up in their finery and stagger out at the end of the day,\" Mr Heath said. Merseyside Police Supt Paul Wilson said anti-social behaviour would not be tolerated and he asked people to treat the area with respect. Last year, there were just 16 arrests during the three-day festival - five on Ladies' Day. None were women, the force said. Merseyrail has introduced bylaws that prevent people who are extremely intoxicated travelling. Music is played and coffee sold in pop-up stores to create a good atmosphere. Over the three days, Mr Heath said the rail company transports 100,000 people - half on Saturday and 30,000 on Ladies' Day. Trains double in frequency to every seven minutes and 12,000 flip-flops are handed out. The flip-flop giveaway also prevents escalator accidents at Liverpool stations, Mr Heath added. While not denying that people may indulge too much, he said they were \"a very small minority.\" \"You don't get this sort of publicity at other events such as York or Ascot,\" he added. \"It's a very jaundiced and unfair reflection on women in Liverpool.\"",

        "article": "John Whittingdale is to take over from Sajid Javid as UK culture secretary, Prime Minister David Cameron has said. Mr Whittingdale has been chair of the House of Commons Culture, Media and Sport select committee for a decade. One of his first duties will be to oversee negotiations for the BBC's charter renewal. He has described the TV licence as \"worse than a poll tax\", although he has said it is likely to survive until at least the 2020s. He will also face the prospect of cuts to his department - the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) - as the new government seeks to eliminate the national budget deficit. And press regulation will be on his agenda. He has previously argued against statutory regulation of the press and said the Leveson Inquiry into media ethics \"strayed\" far beyond its remit. When it comes to understanding the brief, you would be hard pressed to find anyone better. Previous appointments have suggested the department was seen as a post to test out rising stars to see if they were up to running one of the big government departments. John Whittingdale's appointment is different. He is there to do a specific job - decide the future of the BBC. He is no fan of the licence fee, but has said he accepts it will probably survive for the next 10 years. And secondly, almost forgotten now - the issue of press regulation lurks. His summoning of Rupert Murdoch to the culture committee was one of the key moments in the hacking scandal. But anyone waiting for further action to enforce a \"Leveson-compliant\" system of press regulation will probably have to wait a good while longer. Figures from the media and arts worlds have been reacting to his appointment on Twitter: The BBC's royal charter determines the level of the licence fee, currently \u00c2\u00a3145.50, and the other terms under which the corporation operates. The current charter will run out at the end of 2016. As culture secretary, Mr Whittingdale will lead the government's negotiations with the BBC over its renewal. In February, Mr Whittingdale concluded that the TV licence is \"becoming harder and harder to justify\" given changes to technology. As the culture select committee published a report into the future of the BBC, he said there appeared to be \"no realistic alternative to the licence fee\" in the short term, but that the BBC must prepare for the possibility of a change in the 2020s. It could be replaced by a compulsory levy on all households, or be reduced, with some BBC services only available by subscription, the report suggested. In October, he said the licence fee was \"actually worse than a poll tax because under the poll tax, if you were on a very low income you would get a considerable subsidy\", according to The Daily Telegraph. A BBC spokesperson said: \"We're looking forward to working with the new secretary of state.\" Last November, Mr Whittingdale's committee also published a report into the way Arts Council England funds cultural organisations. It concluded that there was a \"clear funding imbalance\" in favour of the capital, and urged Arts Council England to \"restore some balance\" across the country. Arts Council England is funded by the DCMS. However, many in the arts world are braced for further funding reductions as the government seeks to eliminate the budget deficit without raising VAT, income tax or National Insurance. As chair of the select committee, Mr Whittingdale also oversaw recent inquiries into the promotion of tourism in the UK, society lotteries and opportunities for women in sport.",

The 2012 Tour de France champion's assertion was questioned after leaked World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) documents revealed he had been given three injections of allergy medication. \"Brad stands by his comment concerning the use of illegal intravenous needle injections,\" a spokesman said. Wiggins' medical records were leaked by the 'Fancy Bears' hacking team. The records show Wiggins was given permission to take two banned substances on several occasions between 2008 and 2013, prior to competitions including the 2011 and 2012 Tours de France and the 2013 Giro d'Italia. One of the substances, triamcinolone, was taken for an allergy to pollen, according to the certificates. It is the same drug for which disgraced American cyclist Lance Armstrong tested positive at the 1999 Tour de France. However, Wiggins' use of the substance was legal as it was covered by a therapeutic use exemption (TUE) relating to his asthma. In his 2012 book My Time, Wiggins said he had \"never had an injection, apart from I've had my vaccinations, and on occasion I've been put on a drip, when I've come down with diarrhoea or something or have been severely dehydrated\". In a statement, Wiggins' spokesman said his comments in the book referred to the \"historic and illegal practice of intravenous injections of performance-enhancing substances, which was the subject of a law change by [cycling's governing body] the UCI in 2011\". \"The triamcinolone injection that is referred to in the Wada leaks is an intramuscular treatment for asthma and is fully approved by the sport's governing bodies.\" Wiggins also denied controversial Belgian doctor Geert Leinders had had any involvement in the decision to apply for TUEs before major races. Leinders was hired by Team Sky, Wiggins' team at the time, in 2011 and worked for them on a consultancy basis until his name appeared in the United States Anti-Doping Agency's investigation into Armstrong in 2012. Leinders was subsequently banned for life for multiple doping violations carried out when he worked for the Rabobank cycling team between 1996 and 2009. \"Brad has no direct link to Geert Leinders,\" the statement added. \"Leinders was 'on race' doctor for Team Sky for a short period and so was occasionally present at races dealing with injuries sustained whilst racing such as colds, bruises, etc. \"Leinders had no part in Brad's TUE application; Brad's medical assessments from 2011-2015 were processed by the official Team Sky doctor, and were verified by independent specialists.\" A TUE allows an athlete, for medical reasons, to take a prescribed substance or undergo treatment that is otherwise prohibited. British athletes must contact their national governing body or follow UK Anti-Doping (Ukad) guidance before applying for a TUE. There are strict criteria for one to be granted: Ukad says it has \"a number of robust controls in place to make it as difficult as possible\" for athletes to misuse the system.",

They show that there has been an overall increase of 53% in the number of women being treated for the disease in the last 20 years. The rise was described as dramatic by Royal Victoria Hospital statisticians. Dr Anna Gavin, who led the research, said the health system needs to prepare itself as the figures are set to climb. \"I think the services need to gear themselves up because we have done some work looking at past trends,\" Dr Gavin said. \"We see that, in total, the cancer number is expected to increase by two thirds again, about 65% in 20 years. \"The service needs to be aware of that. We need to be thinking of ways to cope because it is largely driven by the aging population.\" Meanwhile, one woman who is living with the disease is calling for greater awareness of inflammatory breast cancer. Lynette McHendry, from County Antrim, is due to have both breasts removed next week. The 37-year-old patient said she believed some inflammatory breast cancer cases are being misdiagnosed. The mother of two is appealing to clinicians to become more aware of the symptoms surrounding this aggressive disease, after her cancer went undetected for over a month. \"The symptoms I had were a pain in my left breast - it was hard, tender and heavy,\" Mrs McHendry said. \"It started to swell up and ended up twice the size. It also became red, inflamed and the skin became dimply. And there was no lump.\" She is in the unusual position of having invasive or regular cancer in one breast and inflammatory cancer in the other. The latter went undetected because, in cases of inflammatory breast cancer, a lump does not appear in the mammogram. Mrs McHendry is one of the almost 2,800 women who were referred last year to the Belfast Cancer centre. Ninety-three percent of those cases were not malignant - but hers was. Mrs McHendry said that although women are better educated about breast cancer, there is little or no public information about inflammatory breast cancer. \"I had to join a support group online based in England,\" she said. \"By talking to those women, including one woman from Larne, I discovered so many weren't diagnosed until much later in their cancer journey, which can make a difference between being diagnosed at stage 3 or stage 4.\"",

Der Tagesspiegel agrees, and tells the EU to \"reform or be destroyed\". But it also warns that there is a \"shocking gulf\" between remedies offered by the political elites - closer integration, especially in economic terms - and the expectations of ordinary Europeans. The answer, it concludes, is \"more openness, more transparency\", as well as a stronger focus on welfare. Under a picture of French and Dutch far right leaders Marine Le Pen and Geert Wilders, an article in Der Spiegel voices alarm at the rise of the \"great simplifiers\", saying they threaten democracy by appealing to the irrational. \"The populists are on the loose, and not just in Great Britain,\" it warns. \"They are dragging Western Europe towards its downfall.\" \"Populism is tearing Europe apart,\" a commentary in Spain's El Pais agrees, but warns that any changes to the EU should not try to appease their \"anti-establishment\" discourse. \"Populist parties have grown by exploiting the idea that the EU is to blame for an economic crisis caused by the whims of the markets,\" it argues Instead, it calls for policies that \"promote stability\" and \"reject blaming Europe for our ills when it is part of the solution\". An article entitled \"the dictatorship of democracy\" in El Mundo voices the fear that other countries could follow Britain's example. \"What is disturbing is that, after Brexit, fools can say with greater strength and certainty: 'Yes you can.'\" In Italy's La Repubblica, a commentary says the vote for Brexit reflects rising general discontent by the \"excluded\" that is driving the rise of the likes of Donald Trump in the US, as well as of Italy's own populist Five Star Movement.

Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, has criticised the UK government for a lack of action and said the appeal against the term was happening in \"secret\". It is understood it is being held in Tehran on Wednesday. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 38 has spent time in solitary confinement since her arrest at Tehran Airport last April, with her two-year-old daughter Gabriella. The child has remained in Iran after the government confiscated her passport and is being looked after by her grandparents. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was sentenced to five years in jail in September on charges that have not been disclosed. Mr Ratcliffe said the family could not go to his wife's appeal hearing and did not know when to expect a result as it was \"another of these secret trials\".

There was a gap of about four weeks between his wife's trial and the verdict, he added. Mr Ratcliffe said his wife had felt suicidal and had started a hunger strike during her time in jail but there was \"more fight in her\" since being moved out of solitary confinement over Christmas. He told BBC Breakfast the outcome of the appeal was \"unpredictable\" as it could see her sentence quashed, reduced or increased.

Striker Diego Costa went off injured for Atletico early on and Barcelona capitalised as Alexis Sanchez smashed in a superb opener. Atletico came out strong in the second half as David Villa hit the post before Diego Godin headed an equaliser. Barcelona would have won the title with a win and Dani Alves went close with a fierce drive, but Atletico held on. The final whistle was greeted by wild celebrations from the Atletico players and coaching staff, while the entire Nou Camp stood to applaud Diego Simeone's side as they finally ended the Barcelona-Real Madrid duopoly in Spanish football. The draw meant Atletico finished first with 90 points, three ahead of Barcelona and Real. It completed what has been a superb season for Atletico, which has seen them take victory at city rivals Real, as well as win nine league games in succession to go top of the table in March. Their run faltered slightly towards the end, as they lost to Levante and drew at home to Malaga, but they went into the game against Barcelona knowing a point would be enough to win the title. If that gave Atletico players any psychological advantage, it was swiftly eradicated when Simeone's side lost two of their key players inside the opening 20 minutes. Their first casualty was Costa. The striker, with 27 goals in the league this season, had only just returned to the side after missing last week's draw with Malaga, and he lasted just 14 minutes before his hamstring went after a brief sprint. Costa limped off in tears and just seven minutes later it got worse for the visitors. Arda Turan, so often the creator of Atletico's better moves this season, landed on his back awkwardly when challenging for possession and he too was unable to continue. To Atletico's credit, they did not let that double blow disrupt them as they managed to keep Barcelona at arm's length, whilst also threatening occasionally themselves. Atletico's Tiago directed a header over the bar from Koke's inviting cross, before Pedro missed with a similar attempt for Barcelona soon after. There had barely been a shot on target in the first half hour but it was a moment of brilliance from Sanchez that gave Barcelona the lead. Cesc Fabregas curled a ball into the box for Lionel Messi who, with his back to goal, chested the ball into the path of an onrushing Sanchez, who smashed a first time effort from the tightest of angles just inside the top right of the Atletico goal. The half-time whistle provided Simeone the chance to offer words of encouragement to his players, and whatever he said evidently worked as the visitors made a storming start to the second half. Villa's shot on the turn struck the post, before the former Barcelona striker saw a low, left-footed effort saved by Pinto, but their pressure paid dividends just five minutes after the restart when Gabi whipped a corner into the middle of the area where Godin rose highest to send a bullet header low into the back of the net. Barcelona needed to regain the initiative if they were to successfully defend the league title and the balance of play quickly swung back in their favour, with the visitors seemingly content to soak up pressure and try and hit the hosts on the counter. Messi, quiet for large periods of the game, had the ball in the net midway through the second half, but the Argentine's effort was ruled offside, before Alves struck a shot from distance that seemed destined for the top corner, only for Atletico keeper Thibaut Courtois to react superbly to push the ball over his goal. The Atletico players held their nerve to keep Barcelona at bay in the final 10 minutes before the final whistle confirmed their status as league champions. With one trophy secured, Simeone will now switch his attention to the Champions League, with Atletico taking on Real Madrid in the final on Saturday, 24 May.",

Is digital going to replace it? What are we losing if that happens and what are we gaining?,'\" says Keanu Reeves. The actor serves as producer, narrator and interviewer on Side by Side, in which he sets out to examine cinema's transition from film to digital formats. It seems a niche subject, but Reeves and director Chris Kenneally say they were conscious about making the film for a mainstream audience. \"We wanted to take something that was quite specialised and share enough information so people could understand what we'd be speaking about,\" Reeves says. But does the average cinema-goer care or notice what format the film they're watching is in? \"If you're not an aficionado, probably not, as long as it was working,\" admits Reeves. \"If you go and expect to see a Hollywood studio movie and it looked terrible you'd go like, 'what is that?' So I think it could impact in that sense. \"But a perfect film print projected is something that is remarkable and unique.\" Side By Side makes no assumptions that audiences will know the technical aspects of filmmaking, so spends some time explaining how cameras work, the photochemical process of developing film and how the introduction of digital cameras has led to the progression of editing and special effects. And helping to explain is a cast that reads like a Who's Who of cinema. Directors Martin Scorsese, Christopher Nolan, David Fincher, David Lynch, James Cameron, Danny Boyle, George Lucas and cinematographers Wally Pfister (Inception, The Dark Knight) and Roger Deakins (Skyfall, True Grit) are all present. Female filmmakers are represented by the likes of legendary editor Anne Coates, who worked on movies like Lawrence of Arabia and The Elephant Man and Lena Dunham, one of Hollywood's hottest talents thanks to her TV show Girls. Reeves conducted a large share of the interviews himself, which not only helped the filmmakers gain such unprecedented access but also made for a series of relaxed, open conversations. \"I can't say it didn't help that I've been in the industry for however many years - I was a known quantity in that sense,\" he says. It took around 18 months to round up and interview all the film-makers. Luckily, a large number of contributors attended an annual cinematography festival in Poland. However others weren't so easy to get. Directors such as Steven Spielberg and Quentin Tarantino are notably absent. \"There were people who weren't available or who didn't want to speak,\" he says. \"We got turned down a few times which sucked.\" Although mainstream Hollywood films have been shot digitally for about the last 12 years, the first digital film to win an Oscar for best cinematography was Slumdog Millionaire in 2009. Cinematography Oscars followed for Avatar in 2010 and Hugo in 2011 - also shot digitally. Some see this as a shift in the attitude towards digital film, which had previously been considered inferior in quality. Filming on celluloid is an expensive and time consuming process. Reels of film that each contain about 10 minutes of footage are developed overnight, creating \"dailies\". Viewing them is the first chance a director will get to see the product of his previous day's work. It is only then they discover if they have the right shots or if they have to go back and re-shoot. The advent of video cameras showed not only that film-making could be done at a fraction of the cost, but that you could see the results immediately. It also enabled anyone to effectively become a film-maker. The invention of low price digital cameras further democratised the film-making process. However, advocates for celluloid include Inception director Christopher Nolan and cinematographer Wally Pfister, who maintain digital images will never have the depth or clarity of film, which they insist on using. On the other side, the likes of George Lucas, James Cameron and David Lynch profess their love for digital and swear they'll never go back. Another issue addressed in the documentary is digital film archiving and preservation - where the introduction of new formats every couple of years is proving to be problematic. Indeed, Se7en director David Fincher says he has videos from the early days of his career in unplayable formats, as the hardware no longer exists. As a result, when he finishes a film, he now stores the relevant player alongside the rushes in his archive, to ensure he is able to watch them back at a later date. And even with modern technology, hard drives can fail, leading to the loss of digital content. It is something Reeves admits he had not considered. \"I had no idea about the situation we're in right now where there is no standardised means of archiving digital information.\" \"I didn't know anything about how it could all just go away - it was a bit jaw-dropping.\" The irony is that celluloid is the only format that has stood the test of time over the past 100 years and will continue to do so as long as there are projectors to play them on. Throughout Side by Side, Reeves maintains his impartiality but with filming complete, he is able to share his thoughts. \"Going into the film I was definitely biased to 'what are we losing?'. Film was being held up as the gold standard and digital was this idea of replacing [it],\" he says. \"But what I've come to learn is that it's not necessarily replacing it - but that it's something else. And if it is that, then film has a better chance. \"I'm still confident that it's going to hang around.\" Side By Side is out in cinemas from Friday, 15 February through Axiom Films.",

The Tower Blocks - Our Blocks project has been described as a \"Domesday Book\" of the UK's post-war reconstruction. It will include images of towers which have been demolished over the past 30 years, as well as those which are still standing. It has been created by social and architectural historians from Edinburgh College of Art. The project is to receive a \u00c2\u00a352,900 grant of Heritage Lottery funding. This money will go towards digitising the 3,500 photographs, as well as supporting local outreach initiatives which the team hope will encourage high-rise residents to tell their stories. Glasgow's Red Road flats and Gorbals housing schemes will be among the multi-storey housing projects on show in the publically accessible digital catalogue. Other well know high rises to feature in the archive include the Everton flats in Liverpool, Birmingham's Chelmsley Wood, Manchester's Hulme redevelopment, and London estates such as Broadwater Farm, Thamesmead and Roehampton. The project is due to be completed by late 2017. Prof Miles Glendinning, head of the Scottish Centre for Conservation Studies at the college of art, said: \"We hope this project will help contribute to the ongoing shift in public attitudes towards the post-war Modernist housing heritage, which is fast turning from an object of dislike and alienation into a force for potential community empowerment. \"Council tower blocks were once the most prominent and dramatic legacy of the post-1945 reconstruction drive, but mass demolitions over the past 35 years, still continuing today, have depleted this vast heritage, leaving it obscured or incomprehensible to the public at a time when popular interest in post-war Modernist heritage is sharply increasing.\" Colin McLean, head of the Heritage Lottery Fund in Scotland, said: \"Without archives, vast segments of our nation's history would be missing. \"As the high rise towers that have dominated many towns' and city's skylines begin to disappear, it is important for us to capture this heritage and give voice to the experiences of those who live in these flats and communities.\" Glasgow 2014 chiefs faced criticism when they planned to demolish the Red Road flats as part of last summer's Commonwealth Games opening ceremony. They eventually ditched the proposal to blow down five of the six remaining 1960s blocks live on television amid fears of a public protest. Critics said it was insensitive to former residents and to the asylum seekers who still occupied the sixth block. When they were built between 1964 and 1969, the Red Road flats were the highest in Europe at 292ft (89 metres).",

The result comes a day after the bank confirmed Jes Staley would be joining as its new chief executive. Barclays said it had seen slow progress with its so-called non-core businesses, which it is selling. Losses for the package of businesses, which includes some investment bank assets and parts of the European retail banking operation, more than doubled to \u00a3337m.

        "article": "The government needs to set out how it will devolve further fiscal powers to Scotland following the rise of the SNP, a former Scottish secretary has said. Lord Forsyth of Drumlean said the SNP election result was a \"revolution\" and could not be overlooked. Meanwhile, former Labour chancellor Alistair Darling said Mr Cameron had the chance of \"building a constitution for the 21st century\". The SNP won 56 of the 59 Scottish seats at Westminster last week. Mr Darling added that in his opinion the rising success of the SNP had \"completely  overtaken\" any agreements made in the Smith Commission - which outlined increased devolution proposals in the wake of the independence referendum last year. Lord Forsyth, a Conservative peer, told the BBC that the big advantage of giving Scotland more powers was that it would prevent SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon producing \"fantasy manifestos\" without raising the cash to pay for it. He said: \"I think we have to recognise what happened in Scotland last Thursday was a revolution. \"The Conservative in me was full of joy for what David Cameron had achieved but the unionist is greatly dismayed. \"We used to say if the SNP won a majority in seats in Scotland then they could have independence. \"They got 50% of the vote and 95% of the seats and the reality is you have to respond to that and I think what the government needs to do is produce a White Paper which sets out how fiscal autonomy, devo-max, call it what you will, would work in practice so people are aware of the advantages and the disadvantages.\" The Conservatives have outlined in their manifesto an \"English votes for English laws\" proposal, which would give MPs for English seats a veto on issues which affect only England, including on income tax. Mr Cameron promised firm proposals within 100 days of forming a government, which would be \"fully implemented\" by the time of the Budget in March of the following year. But Mr Darling warned that such a law could break up the union. He told the BBC: \"...by saying that essentially English MPs will decide tax and spending, you are well on the way to breaking up the Union.\" SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon has previously said if there were matters that were genuinely English only, and had no impact in Scotland, there would be \"a strong case\" for Scottish MPs not voting on them. \"The problem is there's a lot of issues characterised as English-only issues that are anything but - matters relating to the English health service for example. \"Decisions taken on that have a direct impact on Scotland's budget,\" she said.

Hampshire, who chose to bowl, had Essex 0-1 when Nick Browne was caught off the bowling of Fidel Edwards. Rain then caused a lengthy delay, but Cook (114 not out) and Westley (111) dominated when play resumed. Kyle Abbott finally ended their stand, bowling Westley with the last ball of the day as Essex closed on 243-2. England opener Cook's ton was his second of the season, with the former Test captain averaging 81.75 with the bat through five first-class innings this season. He was ably supported by Westley, whose century was his first of the season in first-class cricket. Hampshire could take few positives from a difficult first day, especially after a shoulder injury to fast bowler Edwards, but Abbott's late removal of Westley will leave them with some hope of limiting the hosts' score. Essex batsman Tom Westley: \"It's good to get that first score out of the way. That first Championship hundred of the season is always nice. It was tough going, but it's pleasing to get some runs. What's most pleasing is the position we're in after being put in to bat. \"We would have wanted to bowl first in those conditions. It did nip around in the first hour and a half. It's a good cricketing wicket, but there is definitely a bit in it for the bowlers, but also if they miss their length you feel you score. \"I don't think Cookie will mind me saying we both played and missed. On another day you can nick them and we can be 100 for three or four. But sometimes you have to ride the luck and Cookie's was a chanceless hundred. They bowled well at him, so it wasn't easy going. It's great having him at the other end. He just loves scoring runs. He's a huge asset for the club.\" Hampshire coach Craig White: \"We'll assess Fidel Edwards' injury in the morning, but it looks a bit sore and he'll struggle to take a further part in the game. \"Every game it seems this year we've had a bowler go down. It's not ideal, it's just frustrating. Injuries happen I know but when it happens every game and you're a bowler down you wonder if you're doing something wrong.\" \"It was a frustrating day. At the start we wouldn't have thought they'd only be two wickets down at the end of play. I'm a little bit shocked really. It was great conditions to bowl in and we probably early on didn't get enough balls consistently in the right areas. But you have to take your hat off to those two. They played really well.\"",

Lord Advocate James Wolffe said that without them, Scots' safety and security would be diminished. Writing in an online publication, he backed Scottish government calls for the UK to sign up to new regulations governing EU police agency, Europol. Unless the Home Office opts in, the UK will lose membership by May 2017. The Lord Advocate is meeting MEPs and senior lawyers in Brussels on Wednesday. Writing in EurActiv, he said: \"I firmly believe that it would not be in the interests of Scotland, of the United Kingdom, or of Europe, if we were, as a result of the referendum result, to turn our back on the mechanisms of criminal justice co-operation. \"Indeed, I believe that we should remain a fully committed and active participant in these mechanisms - so that we can maximise our ability to contribute to their work, and to their future development.\" The UK must decide whether to opt into the new Europol regulation by the end of December 2016. Scotland's Justice Secretary Michael Matheson has urged the UK government to confirm it will do so. James Wolffe backed that call and said participation in Europol and Eurojust was in Scotland's vital interest. He said: \"Without them, the safety and security of our citizens will, in my view, be diminished. \"The threat posed, today, by transnational criminality is surely too urgent and real for us to contemplate any weakening of our commitment to police and judicial co-operation with our colleagues in Europe.\" Brandon Lewis, UK policing and fire minister, said: \"The prime minister has stated that law enforcement co-operation will continue when the UK is outside the EU and we will do what is necessary to keep our people safe. \"The government will take a decision on whether to opt-in to the new Europol regulation in due course. \"The UK remains a full member of Europol, and because of our justice and home affairs opt-in, we have the option to seek to opt-in to Europol's new legislative framework. This option remains open to us while we are a member of the EU.\" Since 2011, there have been 541 cases in Scottish courts in which proceedings were taken after an arrest on a European Arrest Warrant (EAW), which are carried out by Europol. A total of 367 individuals were extradited from Scotland through this procedure. In addition, the Crown Office has issued 45 EAWs to bring people back to Scotland quickly to face trial for serious crimes. In the past year the EAW system has been further enhanced within the UK by access to the Schengen Information System. That means EAWs are \"flagged\" on police databases across Europe within hours of issue - minimising the risk that police officers allow wanted individuals to slip through their fingers because they are unaware of the warrant. Eurojust operates in a similar way.

        "article": "Prime Minister David Cameron will later attempt to halt the civil war in his party caused by Iain Duncan Smith's resignation from the cabinet. Mr Duncan Smith has warned the government risks dividing society with politically-motivated spending cuts. Mr Cameron is to reject this - and No 10 has rubbished claims of a rift with George Osborne, saying the chancellor still has the PM's full confidence. The disability cuts Mr Duncan Smith quit over will be shelved. Downing Street said the changes to Personal Independence Payments (PIP) announced ahead of Mr Osborne's Budget last week would not go ahead \"in their current form\". But alternative proposals for saving the \u00c2\u00a34bn earmarked for the savings would not come until the Autumn Statement towards the end of the year. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has called for Mr Osborne's resignation and Conservative MPs have spoken out against the leadership with Mr Duncan Smith's former ministerial team divided in their responses to his resignation. Treasury minister David Gauke is answering an urgent Commons question from Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell on changes to the Budget - Mr McDonnell had called for the chancellor himself but this appears to have been ignored. This will be followed by a statement from Mr Cameron - ostensibly on last week's EU summit - at which he is expected to restate his commitment to \"compassionate Conservatism\" and reject Mr Duncan Smith's criticisms of his style of government. Former Tory leader Lord Howard urged MPs to \"listen to what the prime minister has to say\" and to \"calm down\". Mr Duncan Smith set out the reasons for his surprise resignation in an interview with the BBC's Andrew Marr, in which he said the way Mr Osborne had cut benefits in his Budget at the same time as cutting taxes for the better off was \"deeply unfair\" and that he had become \"semi detached\" from government. Ross Hawkins, BBC political correspondent George Osborne: chief tactician and patron, a man whose word makes or wrecks careers. That was the view of many Tory MPs for a very long time. Now, many doubt he will ever be their leader, or even the chancellor much longer. It's not that they think David Cameron is poised to sack him or that he's about to resign, as Labour demand. They simply believe a swift leadership election is highly likely whatever the result of 23 June's EU referendum. If it does come that soon, there will be - one predicts - a \"genocide of the Cameroons and Osbornites\". A stubbornly enduring deficit, a tax credit U-turn, and the sheer numbers of MPs who have chosen to back a leave vote at the referendum have seen Osborne's authority leak. A weekend of melodrama has - in one Tory MP's view - burst the dam. Read more from Ross Lord Howard played down Mr Duncan Smith's criticisms of government policy - but Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston said they were \"very serious\". \"Today, when David Cameron stands up, he has to reaffirm the message that led many people like myself to join the Conservative Party in the first place when he became leader,\" she said. \"Are we about social justice? Are we about spreading the burden fairly? We need to hear that very clear message today.\" She suggested pensioner benefits - which the Conservatives pledged to protect in their manifesto - should be cut to make up the shortfall. A number of senior Conservative figures have questioned Mr Osborne's credentials to replace David Cameron as prime minister when he steps down. Former chief whip Andrew Mitchell described Mr Osborne's abortive attempt to reform PIP as a \"cock-up\". He said Mr Osborne was \"not the only candidate\" for the party leadership and there were a \"large number\" of alternatives. Influential backbencher David Davis told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire the \u00c2\u00a34bn welfare savings should be cancelled and suggested Mr Osborne should be moved to another department if he wants to be a successful replacement for David Cameron as prime minister. London Mayor Boris Johnson, seen as Mr Osborne's main rival for the top job, is returning from a skiing holiday and has yet to comment. BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said it was understood Mr Cameron had urged Mr Osborne to avoid any major controversy in the Budget so as to avoid fuelling discontent among Tory MPs ahead of the EU referendum. Despite this, our correspondent said, Downing Street insists \"the two men remain as close as ever\", and have dismissed reports that the prime minister will seek to distance himself from Mr Osborne. Number 10 has stressed that PIP will still have to be reformed in the future as the cost is \"unsustainable.\" Mr Corbyn told the BBC Mr Osborne should be \"considering his position\". \"His Budget simply doesn't add up and it unravelled within hours of him presenting it. This isn't the first time a George Osborne Budget has unravelled,\" the Labour leader told BBC1's Breakfast programme. \"It seems to me we need to look at the very heart of this government, at its incompetence, at the way it puts forward proposals that simply don't add up and expects the most needy in our society to take the hit for them.\" Who would the disability changes impact?",

Regular judges Matthew Fort and Oliver Peyton will return for the 12th series. Leith, who is also a novelist, said she had enjoyed \"eating and judging the very best in modern British cooking\". She said: \"From the first Great British Menu for the Queen's 80th birthday to honouring those who fought on D-Day, I've been repeatedly amazed at the inventiveness and skill of the chefs. \"I am very proud of the banquets we've put together.

She said: \"It's such an iconic programme and I have watched it religiously from the very beginning. \"I love that it celebrates the extraordinary levels of culinary excellence in this country, so being part of that and having the chance to taste some truly incredible food from the best chefs in the country is hugely exciting.\" She first appeared on TV in the band Rip, Rig and Panic with Neneh Cherry, and has also presented from the Brit Awards and Glastonbury Festival. Her daughter is TV presenter Miquita Oliver. Peyton said it was a \"massive shock\" to learn Leith was leaving, describing her as \"a legend\". \"I will truly miss Prue but I'm a huge fan of Andi's and can't wait for her to join us,\" he said. Fort said he would miss Leith's \"elegant presence, good humour, practical culinary sensibility and occasional verbal clip around the ears\". He described her replacement as \"charming, funny and blessed with sound gastronomic judgement\". Chefs to have taken part in the series over the past 11 series include Angela Hartnett, Simon Rogan, Marcus Wareing, Lisa Allen and Jason Atherton. Friday's finale saw Mark Abbott, Tommy Banks, Mark Froydenlund and Adam Reid - who have five Michelin stars between them - serving their dishes at a banquet for people who have been honoured by the Queen, in an event to mark her 90th birthday.

The British-born writer, sister of actress Joan Collins, died in Los Angeles, her spokeswoman said. Collins's raunchy novels of the rich and famous sold more than 500 million copies in 40 countries. In a career spanning four decades, all 32 of her novels appeared in the New York Times bestseller list. The family statement said the writer lived \"a wonderfully full life\", adored by family, friends and readers. \"She was a true inspiration, a trailblazer for women in fiction and a creative force. She will live on through her characters but we already miss her beyond words,\" it added. Collins was diagnosed with stage-four breast cancer six-and-a-half years ago, according to US celebrity magazine People. She told the magazine in her last interview on 14 September that she had told few people about her diagnosis other than her three daughters, and did not regret her decision. \"I did it my way, as Frank Sinatra would say,\" she said. \"I've written five books since the diagnosis, I've lived my life, I've travelled all over the world, I have not turned down book tours and no-one has ever known until now when I feel as though I should come out with it.\" She was in the UK less than a fortnight ago on a promotional tour for her latest book. Her sister Joan, 82, who only learned the news herself in the last fortnight, told People magazine she was \"completely devastated\". \"She was my best friend. I admire how she handled this. She was a wonderful, brave and a beautiful person and I love her,\" she said. Jackie Collins, who was born in London, began writing as a teenager, making up racy stories for her schoolfriends, according to a biography on her website. Her first novel, The World is Full of Married Men, was published in 1968 and became a scandalous bestseller. It was banned in Australia and branded \"disgusting\" by romance writer Barbara Cartland. In 1985, her novel Hollywood Wives was made into a mini-series by ABC, starring Anthony Hopkins and Candice Bergen. Collins said that she \"never felt bashful writing about sex\". \"I think I've helped people's sex lives,\" she said. \"Sex is a driving force in the world so I don't think it's unusual that I write about sex. I try to make it erotic, too.\" Collins had lost her mother, second husband and fiance to cancer. She told the Press Association earlier this month that she had chosen to celebrate life rather than mourn those she had lost. \"I refuse to mourn people, because everybody dies,\" she said. \"Death and taxes, you can't avoid either\". Private memorial services are due to be held for her family in both the UK and in the US.",

        "article": "Brunhilde Pomsel, the former secretary to Nazi Germany's propaganda boss Joseph Goebbels, has died aged 106. Her job brought her into close contact with Goebbels - one of the worst war criminals of the 20th century. She was one of the last surviving members of staff from the Nazi hierarchy, who only spoke about her experience later in life. In a recent documentary, she said she had known nothing of the murder of six million Jews during the Holocaust. In \"A German Life\", which was released last year, she said she felt no guilt - \"unless you end up blaming the entire German population\". Born in January 1911, Ms Pomsel worked as a writer for a Jewish insurance broker for a number of years during her late teenage years, before taking a similar job with a right-wing writer. Although she claimed that she had always been apolitical, she joined the Nazi party when they took power in 1933, in order to take a government job with German national radio. Her skill as a typist, she said, brought her to the role of Joseph Goebbels' secretary in 1942, during the war, when he was minister of \"public enlightenment and propaganda\". She described Goebbels as \"a good looking man ... a bit short\", who was always well-groomed and well-dressed - but arrogant. She said she was simply a secretary and knew little of the Nazi's brutal actions during the Holocaust. \"The people who today say they would have done more for those poor, persecuted Jews\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I really believe that they sincerely mean it,\" she said in interviews for A German Life. \"But they wouldn't have done it either.\" But she always maintained that she did not share in the blame for the actions of her superiors. \"I wouldn't see myself as being guilty,\" she said. \"Unless you end up blaming the entire German population for ultimately enabling that government to take control. That was all of us. Including me.\" Her Jewish friend, Eva Lowenthal, disappeared in November 1943. Sixty years later, Ms Pomsel discovered she had died in the Auschwitz concentration camp. Ms Pomsel was captured by Soviet troops at the end of World War Two - and spent the following five years in detention camps, before rejoining German broadcasting in 1950, where she worked for the next 20 years. She would not speak openly about her time serving the senior Nazi official until a 2011 newspaper interview, and more extensively in the 2016 documentary. She passed away in Munich a few weeks after her 106th birthday.",

Concerns for her welfare were raised by Paul Netherton, assistant chief constable at Devon and Cornwall Police. He spoke out on Twitter on behalf of the girl, who had been held in a cell since Thursday because, he said, no beds were available anywhere in the UK. NHS England said the 16-year-old would be moved on Saturday night. A spokesman said: \"After details were provided to NHS England about the girl and her condition, a place was found locally within a few hours. \"We are grateful for the help of the NHS in the area in identifying the place. \"It is worth noting that mental health crisis services have been expanding so that the number of people ending up in police cells is in fact down - but clearly more needs to be done.\" Earlier on Twitter, Mr Netherton had described the situation as \"unacceptable\". He tweeted: \"We have a 16yr old girl suffering from mental health issues held in police custody. There are no beds available in the uk! \"The 16yr old was detained on Thursday night, sectioned Friday lunchtime and still no place of safety available. This can't be right! \"Custody on a Fri & Sat night is no place for a child suffering mental health issues. Nurses being sourced to look after her in custody !?!\" He later  tweeted: \"Just heard that a place of care has been found for our 16yr old. Good result.\" Mr Netherton told BBC News the girl had been arrested at Torbay Hospital on Thursday after a breach of the peace and sectioned under the Mental Health Act on Friday because she was \"obviously very unwell\". \"We shouldn't have children, a schoolgirl, staying overnight in a custody block,\" he said. According to the officer, 750 mental health patients had been placed in police cells across Devon and Cornwall so far this year. Shadow health minister Luciana Berger described the teenager's predicament as \"an appalling reflection of the crisis in mental health services\". \"People shouldn't face the indignity of being kept in police cells when they are at their most vulnerable,\" she said. Mark Winstanley, chief executive of mental health charity Rethink, said: \"Each year thousands of people with serious mental health problems are being held in police cells, including many children and teenagers, because the right services either don't exist in their community or are completely overstretched. \"Many people are being turned away from places of safety, because of staff shortages or lack of spaces. \"In some parts of the country, there are no health-based places of safety full-stop. \"As a result, people end up being held in police stations, or are simply left to fend for themselves. This has to change, as it's costing lives. \"Someone going through a physical health emergency would never be treated this way, so why should it be acceptable for people experiencing a mental health crisis?\"",

        "article": "A State Department official \"pressured\" the FBI to change the classification of a Hillary Clinton email in a \"quid pro quo\", according to FBI documents. Under Secretary of State Patrick Kennedy asked the bureau to unclassify the message so it could be archived, \"never to be seen again\". He made the request in relation to an email about the 2012 attacks on the US diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya. But the FBI said it did not change the classification level. The email in question described reports in November 2012 that Libyan police were arresting suspects in the attack of two months earlier, which left Ambassador Christopher Stephens and three other Americans dead. Other interesting revelations from the newly released FBI documents include: The 100-page FBI document published on Monday says an unnamed FBI official was \"pressured\" in summer last year to change the classified Clinton email to unclassified. The official said he had received a call from a colleague - whose name is also redacted - at the FBI's International Operations Division. The colleague said he had been contacted by Mr Kennedy asking him to change the email's classification level in \"exchange for a 'quid pro quo'\". The State Department, the FBI document says, offered to \"reciprocate by allowing the FBI to place more Agents in countries where they are presently forbidden\". Mr Kennedy, according to the FBI documents, followed up on this matter at a subsequent meeting, spending 15 minutes attempting to influence the FBI to unclassify the Clinton email. He also pressed FBI assistant director of counterterrorism Michael Steinbach on the issue. Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said the revelation \"bears all the signs of a cover-up\". Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump tweeted: \"Unbelievable.\" Mr Kennedy, who has spent more than four decades at the State Department, was already a lightning rod for Republican criticism. He oversaw both diplomatic security during the 2012 attacks in Benghazi and the records and IT departments during Mrs Clinton's use of a private email server. But State Department Deputy spokesman Mark Toner denied any wrongdoing by Mr Kennedy. \"Under Secretary Kennedy sought to understand the FBI's process for withholding certain information from public release,\" Mr Toner said. \"As has been reported, there have been discussions within the interagency on issues of classification.\" The email in question was among some 100 messages recovered from Mrs Clinton's private email server that the FBI would ultimately designate as classified. The FBI and State Department engaged in a review of the former secretary of state's emails as they were being made ready for public release. FBI Director James Comey concluded in his investigation Mrs Clinton had been \"extremely careless\" in handling the classified material. The scandal has fuelled the perception among many voters she is untrustworthy. The emails scandal relating to her private server is different from the messages that Wikileaks have been releasing recently.",

        "article": "Public satisfaction with the NHS has dropped by a record amount, the British Social Attitudes Survey suggests. The poll indicates satisfaction fell from 70% to 58% last year - the largest annual drop since it started in 1983. The King's Fund think tank sponsored the NHS questions put to more than 1,000 people and said their answers appeared to be a comment on reforms and spending squeezes and not care quality. The government said the survey contradicted its poll among patients. The survey formed part of the wider British Social Attitudes Survey, which covers a whole host of policy areas. When asked what they think of their care, most patients are grateful for their treatment and give the NHS a thumbs up. This is illustrated by the results of the latest annual patients survey, which reveals nine in 10 would rate their care as good, very good or excellent. Understandably, ministers have highlighted that research to suggest that all is rosy in the health service. But that does not mean that the findings of the British Social Attitudes Survey are not important. They are in effect an emotional stock-take of what the public thinks the present and future holds for the health service. The NHS - like the rest of the public sector - is facing a tough challenge. Rising demands and a squeeze on finances means the pressure is on - and this drop in satisfaction suggests the public are worried. The 1,096 respondents to the health questions were asked \"how satisfied or dissatisfied\"  they were with the way in which the National Health Service was run. The King's Fund released the findings on the NHS as it has taken on responsibility for funding that element of the research after the government pulled out last year. Prof John Appleby, chief economist at the King's Fund, said the poll was important because it had tracked satisfaction over such a long period of time. \"It is not surprising this has happened when the NHS is facing a well-publicised spending squeeze. \"Nevertheless, it is something of a shock that it has fallen so significantly. \"This will be a concern to the government given it appears to be closely linked with the debate on its NHS reforms.\" The King's Fund said it had reached that conclusion because performance measures, such as waiting times and hospital infection rates, remained low. When the figures are broken down in more detail they show similar patterns. Satisfaction fell among supporters of all three main political parties - although unsurprisingly if dropped most among Labour voters. The falls were similar when England was compared with Scotland and Wales combined. While the NHS reforms apply only to England, the King's Fund suggested there could be some \"leakage\" into the public consciousness elsewhere. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said the survey results \"clearly reflect David Cameron's disastrous decision to reorganise the NHS at a time of financial distress. Patients are beginning to see the signs of a service in distress.\" He said A&E waiting times over winter, reports of patients on trolleys in corridors, redundancies, and \"reports of services being restricted\" were \"leading people to feel worried about the future of the NHS\". And Mike Farrar, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, added: \"These results give us a sharp indication that the public have become worried and confused about what is going on with the NHS.\" But Health Minister Simon Burns said the findings contradicted the government's own research which showed satisfaction rates remained high. In particular, he highlighted the annual patient survey which showed that 92% of patients said their experience was good, very good or excellent. \"The British Social Attitudes Survey targets the general public rather than targeting people that have actually used the NHS, so responses are influenced by other factors. \"By its nature it is not as accurate a picture as the data from patients.\"",

        "article": "In the arts, 2016 has been a year of farewells, in Northern Ireland as across the globe. While music fans around the world mourned the loss of artists like David Bowie, Prince and Leonard Cohen, two important local voices were also silenced. After a career playing alongside figures like Joe Cocker, Paul McCartney and Jimi Hendrix, legendary guitarist Henry McCullough died in June. Meanwhile, Mark Knopfler of Dire Straits and Van Morrison were among those to pay tribute to Belfast singer-songwriter Bap Kennedy, who succumbed to cancer aged only 54 in November. Artist Basil Blackshaw also passed away this year and, in December, poet John Montague died in his adopted home of France. Both had reputations in their respective arts which spread far beyond Northern Ireland. It was also announced this year that a permanent memorial to another local legend, Rory Gallagher, was planned. A statue of the great guitarist is to be put up in 2017 outside the Ulster Hall, where Gallagher played regularly throughout the Troubles in Northern Ireland. There were also a number of notable musical birthdays in 2016. BBC Radio Ulster's Across the Line, which has always championed local music, celebrated its 30th, while The Undertones marked 40 years together with a special BBC gig. Despite recent doubts over its future, the Ulster Orchestra celebrated its half century with a special day of 50 concerts across Belfast in September. After putting it on a more stable financial footing, Sir George Bain stepped down as chair late in the year, replaced by Stephen Peover. Money worries elsewhere in the arts did not disappear, however. With the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure (DCAL) abolished, the arts became the responsibility of the Department for Communities (DfC) under a new minister, the DUP's Paul Givan. The new department subsequently cut their grant to the Arts Council of Northern Ireland by \u00c2\u00a3500,000 in July. As the Arts Council is the main funding body for many arts organisations, this led to more concerns over sustainability for some. One major artist also announced she would be leaving Northern Ireland early in 2017. Former Belfast poet laureate Sinead Morrissey announced she was departing the city for a new post at Newcastle University. She is one of Britain's leading poets having won the world-renowned TS Eliot prize in 2014 for her collection, Parallax, following in the footsteps of both Seamus Heaney and Paul Muldoon. There were, however, some notable successes on the big and small screen for Northern Ireland linked productions. In September, Game of Thrones broke the record for the highest number of Emmy Awards won by any fictional series with a total of 38. However, in August, US broadcaster HBO confirmed that the series would end after its eighth season in 2018. As it is mainly filmed in Northern Ireland it will leave a big gap, although NI Screen also said it would leave a strong legacy of local expertise in the industry. Elsewhere, Belfast production company Sixteen South won a children's Bafta, while World War Two drama, My Mother and Other Strangers, which was set and shot locally, was broadcast on a prime Sunday night slot on BBC 1. At the prestigious Venice film festival in September the red carpet came out for the global premiere of The Journey, written by Bangor's Colin Bateman. The drama was a fictional account of the relationship between Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness and the late first minister Ian Paisley, starring Colm Meaney and Timothy Spall. An artistic portrayal of an even more notable figure was unveiled in November. County Down artist Colin Davidson was present as his portrait of the Queen was unveiled by the monarch in London. Mr Davidson said that he felt the work was a \"symbol\" of the Queen's role in advancing a closer relationship between Britain and Ireland. One art form which has taken Irish culture to the world put on a show at Belfast's Waterfront Hall in November. Around 1,600 competitors from all over the globe took part in the week-long 2016 All- Ireland Irish Dance Championships, bringing a dash of colour to what had been, at times, a dark year.",

        "article": "The most disappointing thing about watching Northern Ireland start Euro 2016 with a defeat to Poland was our lack of threat in the final third. Media playback is not supported on this device Our set-pieces were poor and we should have kept possession far better in open play. The midfield three who were meant to be supporting Kyle Lafferty did not get forward enough and, when he was up front on his own, he got no decent service at all. Yes, Poland dominated the game but Northern Ireland are used to that happening and I could tell from listening to their captain Steven Davis talk after the final whistle that he also felt they should have done better with the ball at certain times. You have got to remember these players are in the finals of a major tournament for the first time and maybe it will take them time to adapt to it. It certainly looked as if they gave Poland a little bit too much respect, especially in the first half, but there were some positives, too - as a defensive unit, we were excellent. For all of Poland's possession - and in the first half it was 68% - they did not batter Northern Ireland and it took them until the 29th minute to force Michael McGovern into a save. Michael O'Neill's team were excellent at staying compact and forcing the ball into wider areas but, as I said to Gary Lineker at half-time, the 10-15 minutes after the interval were vital. Unfortunately the Poles scored six minutes into the second half and I kind of saw it coming. When your team has been defending and concentrating so much for the entire first 45 minutes, it is difficult to quickly get back up to the same levels again straight after the break and they just got caught cold. Media playback is not supported on this device Northern Ireland are usually big on set-plays whoever they play and they would have worked on them a lot in the run-up to this game because they know they are not going to play through teams at this level. But apart from one well-worked free-kick where the ball just ran away from Davis in front of goal, they just did not nail them in Nice. When O'Neill brought on Conor Washington in the second half and switched to playing two up front, we carried a bit more of a threat. You could not question the effort and application of our players and the thousands of travelling fans, and everyone back home, should be very proud of them. Even so, Poland deserved to win. It was a disappointing result but it has not changed much about the Ukraine game from a Northern Ireland point of view. For me, they are not as strong as Poland or Germany and it was always the easiest-looking game in Group C. If we want to qualify out of this group, then we are going to have to win in Lyon on Thursday. How will we do it? Well, I think O'Neill might start out by being cautious to begin with. He will want to keep his favoured three-centre-halves intact but I think he will be tempted to go with two strikers so a 3-5-2 formation would work. That is the approach I would favour. Yes, we have lost our first match but one win could get us to the last 16 and, with Germany to play in our final group game, the best chance of us getting that will be against Ukraine.

        "article": "\"You gotta roll with it,\" blares out Liam Gallagher as the Oasis hit combines with the rain  thundering onto the roof of Manchester City's indoor academy pitch. The racket threatens to drown out coach Simon Davies. The City Under-21 assistant coach is using digital technology to explain to a bunch of slightly unfit reporters how he wants a coaching drill involving the use of overlapping players to develop. And just as Mr Davies successfully cuts through the surrounding noise, so the club is attempting to cut through the increasing business \"noise\" - all the playing and supporter data it is endlessly accumulating and managing. The club, which has been at the forefront of data analytics, has signed a new deal to help it make sense of all this data. The City Football Group (CFG), which comprises Manchester City, New York City, Melbourne City and Yokohama Marinos, has entered into a global, multi-year marketing and technology partnership with German software giant, SAP. \"The intersection between sport and technology might change the landscape about what we do in the future,\" says Ferran Soriano, chief executive of both Man City and CFG. At the more prosaic - but financially important - level, CFG says the SAP deal means it will be able to operate more interactively as a global football business. All four clubs will be \"speaking the same business language\" by using the same systems, and swapping best practice when it comes to marketing, for example, as well as enabling the quartet to stay efficiently inter-connected. However, on the more visionary, and, as Mr Soriano says, \"emotional\" fronts, CFG believes the SAP tie-up will be of huge value in revolutionising both their playing and fan operations. All Premier League clubs have data analysts, as do many in the lower divisions, with stats crunched on everything from the distance covered by a player in a game to the number of crosses played with either foot. In fact, every step on the pitch is monitored now. Similarly, away from match day, thousands of hours of training data is accumulated, while injury, dietary, sleep and medical data is also harvested and studied. Assisted by SAP, which worked with the successful German 2014 World Cup-winning squad, the teams will use the insights derived from this data to produce everything from individual player coaching and training programmes, to tactics tailored to counter each opposition team. But CFG, which is owned by the Abu Dhabi United Group, believes that all this sports data could eventually be condensed and a whole whole new way of playing emerge. \"Technology will allow us to play better football,\" says Mr Soriano, who formerly worked at Spanish giant Barcelona. \"We are going to work together in finding new ways of understanding the game, and designing a better game to help us win.\" That vision of creating a new way of playing - a new Total Football or tiki-taka for the future - is shared by colleague and former player, Brian Marwood. He won a league title with Arsenal in 1988/89, and is managing director of the football group's City Football Services. He oversees the recruitment, development, training and management of hundreds of players in Manchester and at other global training centres. \"We have a great opportunity to lead in football, and are searching for the next trend. which will keep us ahead of everyone else,\" says Mr Marwood. \"We have got a team of people trying to find out what the next 10 to 20 years of football will look like. We want to be ahead of the game.\" To that end, a research and innovation group for all four clubs is being created. Another major goal is to use data to enhance the fan experience. CFG believes that with SAP's assistance they can change the way supporters of the group's four teams access and consume football data. Tom Glick, president of New York City FC says that CFG will be looking to enhance the viewing experience of fans, whether \"glued to the action\" at the stadium, or sitting at home watching on TV. \"The task of finding new ways to get this information to the fans starts now,\" he says. \"We will be asking them what additional information and data about the game and players they would look to see - what is important to them.\" The first innovation in this area will be a large digital statistics wall installed at Man City's Etihad Stadium from next season, which will show player and match statistics from the previous game. \"I can see the attraction in providing supporters with access to match data, particularly among the younger tech-aware generation in their teens and twenties,\" says Kevin Parker, secretary of the Man City supporters club. \"We have all got an opinion on how our players are playing during a game and whether a particular player - for example Fernandinho - has worked as hard or not as it appears to fans at the game,\" he says. \"Or you can confirm whether David Silva or Yaya Toure have played those key passes that you thought they had. That can all add to the whole spectacle and enjoyment of the game, and provide talking points.\" But he warns that \"some of the more vociferous elements at a match might get on a player's back\" if their match data was not impressive.

MPs on the Public Accounts Committee accused them of making corporate taxable income \"vanish into thin air\". But the tax chiefs, including from PwC and KPMG, said many common assumptions about avoidance schemes were wrong. Jane McCormick, KPMG's tax head, said there was \"no appetite among clients\" to do anything outside the law. The committee was taking evidence from the Big Four accountancy firms, which also includes Deloitte and Ernst & Young, at a time when issues of tax avoidance have moved centre stage. Revelations about the tax arrangements of companies including Google, Amazon and Starbucks - which use the Big Four - have sparked a debate about tax avoidance. Last week, Prime Minister David Cameron said countries had to work together to clamp down on aggressive avoidance schemes. The tax heads defended the use of tax havens, arguing that it was wrong to say that companies just routed money through \"doors with a brass nameplate\". If a company is registered in a tax haven, it has to have staff and facilities there, said Kevin Nicholson, PwC's head of tax. \"If there was no substance there, the advice would not work,\" he said. The panel of experts also rejected suggestions that by advising companies to avoid tax, they were breaching the spirit of the Companies Act, which requires directors to act in good faith and maintain high standards. Asked by PAC chairwoman Margaret Hodge about the legality of some avoidance advice, the tax heads accepted that 10 or more years ago, the advice may have sailed closed to the wind. However, John Dixon, tax head at Ernst & Young, said: \"The advice we give is based on substance and fact. I think that the world you refer to is gone.\" The four experts were also questioned on their relationship with government. All the Big Four provide technical advice to Whitehall on the drafting of tax legislation. The MPs accused the firms of then advising corporate clients on how to avoid this legislation. Ms Hodge said the firms should be barred from getting government contracts in order to avoid a conflict of interest. But PwC's Mr Nicolson said: \"The role we play makes the tax system work.\" As the committee hearing came to a close, the tax experts also took exception to Ms Hodge's parting shot. She praised their abilities, intelligence and expertise, adding: \"You could give so much more to the public good, but you choose to work in areas that reduce resources\" for schools, hospitals and society. All the experts replied that they were very proud of what they did.",

        "article": "Government plans to ring-fence the banks - protecting retail banking from the riskier investment side - \"fall well short of what is required\", a report has warned. The Banking Standards Commission wants the government to \"electrify\" the fence so banks won't try to \"game\" the rules. That means regulators having the power to fully break up a bank if it does not follow the ring-fence proposals. The bank reforms will go before Parliament early next year. The Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards, known as the Banking Commission for short, was asked by Chancellor George Osborne to study the draft version of the government's Financial Services (Banking Reform) Bill. This follows last year's recommendation by the Independent Commission on Banking, which was led by Sir John Vickers. Sir John concluded that ring-fencing was the best way to protect \"core\" retail banking activities from any future investment banking losses, such as were seen during the global financial crisis. Banking reform: What has changed since the crisis? The government's proposed bill hinged on three main aspects: But the government's draft legislation was a watered-down version of the Vickers report which proposed quite a high degree of separation, said Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Banking Standards Commission. \"The proposals as they stand [in the Bill], fall well short of what is required,\" he said. \"What we've done with the Commission proposals is to put back some of that stiff separation into the ring-fence and then make clear that the key problem - that banks are going to be at the ring-fence all the time, which will be a nightmare for regulators - needs to be dealt with,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \"And the way to do that is to say to banks 'If you don't try to game this ring-fence we won't see the need to separate you.' \"Then they will have a massive incentive to get to a point where banks have certainty [not to be broken up].\" \"That is why we recommend electrification. The legislation needs to set out a reserve power for separation - the regulator needs to know he can use it.\" Under the draft bill, ring-fencing would ensure that retail services of a struggling lender can be carried on independently and smoothly even if authorities let the rest of the group fail. For example, in the case of a failing banking group, regulators could sell off its core activities - thereby maintaining continuity for depositors - while allowing the rest of the organisation to go through a bankruptcy process. Secondly, retail deposits (but not pension liabilities) would be ranked ahead of the claims of other bank creditors in the event of a bank insolvency. Thirdly, banks are to hold a sufficient capital buffer - as outlined by global regulators - which means that if banks do fail, losses can be absorbed by shareholders and other creditors rather than the taxpayer. Ring-fenced banks would also be prohibited from carrying out a range of investment and wholesale banking activities, including the sale of complex derivatives, which are highly complicated contracts designed to hedge borrowers against certain risks but can lead to heavy losses if they go sour. But in a concession, the Banking Commission proposal agreed to the use of simple derivatives, such as currency hedges, for banks within the ring-fenced body. Under the draft legislation, the Treasury would have the authority to decide which banks ring-fencing should apply to, as well as specific activities to be undertaken within ring-fenced banks. The Prudential Regulation Authority, which will become the UK's regulator for deposit-taking institutions in April under the Bank of England, would have the power to ensure the ring-fenced bank to carry on with its business. Mr Tyrie has also called on independent reviews of the effectiveness of the ring-fence proposals across all banks to take place at least once every four years. \"Remember at the moment banks will probably behave, but in the long run they will find a way to gaming the ring-fence if they don't have a strong disincentive to do so,\" he told the BBC. \"In 10-20 years time... people will get complacent. At that point it's crucial to have a set of rules to keep banks well away from testing this ring-fence.\" Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said: \"As Ed Miliband and I said at the Labour conference this year, if the letter and spirit of the Vickers proposals are not delivered and we do not see cultural change in our banks, full separation will be necessary. \"The Commission is clearly right to say the jury is still out and to demand a reserve power for full separation of the banks.\" The Commission's report comes a month after Mr Osborne urged its members not to send the government's proposed reform \"back to square one\" by \"unpicking\" the consensus on how it should be carried out. Business Secretary Vince Cable, who has often been at loggerheads with Mr Osborne over how tough banking reforms should be, said: \"I think we originally came out at it from opposite directions, but we've come to a common view that the ring-fencing solution is the best way forward.\" \"I think he [George Osborne] is quite right to say the last thing we want is to create more uncertainty,\" he told the BBC. However, the banking industry was less enthusiastic about the proposals, saying lingering uncertainty about the future shape of the banking industry threatened banks' ability to lend and to compete. \"The risk here is creating uncertainty,\" Anthony Browne, the chief executive of the British Bankers' Association (BBA), told the BBC. \"If it's perpetually hanging over the banking sector that individual banks or the whole sector could be broken up at some point, then it's going to be difficult to return to having an investable banking sector that can be customer-focused and globally competitive and do what it should be doing, which is lending to homeowners and businesses.\" Mark Field, a Conservative MP whose constituency includes the City of London, also warned of the dangers of uncertainty hanging over the banking sector. He said the 2019 deadline for banks to fully implement the reforms - as the Vickers report proposed - needed to be brought forward. Mr Cable said the government wanted to \"crack on with it\". \"We want to make sure that by the end of this parliament we have something proper in place,\" he said. \"But if there are good proposals coming from parliamentarians to deal with the strengthening of the ring-fence - as Sir John said it has to be effective, that's the whole point of it - then we obviously will have to look at that.\"",

In a dismal Dons performance, Samir Hadji gave the hosts a deserved lead when he raced onto a loose ball and lashed it home just before half-time. As Aberdeen continued to create little after the break, Emmanuel Francoise thumped the ball off the post. But despite dominating, the hosts could not find the second goal they needed. The Dons live to fight another day and will face Latvian side Ventspils in the second qualifying round, with the first leg at Pittodrie next Thursday. But they were well short of their best, with Fola Esch claiming their first-ever win in a  European tie. It was Fola who were the more dangerous of the two sides in the opening minutes as they attempted to pull back the two-goal deficit from the first leg. An audacious effort from the halfway line almost caught out Dons goalkeeper Joe Lewis, before Hadji raced to the near post and tested the Englishman from close-range. The hosts pressed again when Mehdi Kirch sent a left-foot shot wide from distance, before Shay Logan had a similar strike at the other end with Aberdeen's first effort of the game. Peter Pawlett, making a rare start for the Dons in place of the rested Niall McGinn, cut a neat ball across from the byline for Jayden Stockley and goalkeeper Thomas Hym had to be alert to deny him from close-range. The best chances were continuing to fall to the hosts, though. Hadji was not too far away with a back-post header from a corner, before Stefano Bensi volleyed over. A goal was coming and it was no surprise when Hadji found the net on the stroke of half-time. Bensi stabbed the ball through the heart of the defence, and with Ash Taylor caught between the player and the ball, Hadji raced past him and fired beyond goalkeeper Joe Lewis. Manager Derek McInnes' frustration was apparent with a double substitution at the interval, with Pawlett and debutant Anthony O'Connor being replaced by Willo Flood and Mark Reynolds. The Dons though continued to toil and goalkeeper Lewis twice denied the hosts in quick succession; first tipping Bensi's curling effort wide before getting to Tom Laterza's low shot from the resultant corner. A second goal from the hosts would have been enough to send the Dons out of Europe, and that nearly became a reality when Logan stood off Francoise and allowed him to rattle the ball off the inside of the post. Flood appeared to have injured himself in a clumsy challenge on Fola's Ryan Klapp, and with Aberdeen having used all three substitutes, he was a passenger for the final 20 minutes. That allowed the home side to continue to go forward in numbers, and Gerson Rodrigues should have done better with a weak shot from the edge of the box. Adam Rooney was booked for diving after going down in the box in a rare reprieve from late Fola pressure, with Hadji nearly poking a cross beyond Lewis in the last minute.",

        "article": "\"Maverick\" is a word that seems to follow Craig Venter around. The biologist and entrepreneur turned the effort to map the human genome into a competitive race and, in so doing, was vilified by the scientific community. Dr Venter has certainly not gained a reputation for modesty about his achievements. \"Is my science of a level consistent with other people who have gotten the Nobel? Yes,\" he was once quoted as saying. And he is a very wealthy user of Lear Jets and private yachts. But his efforts in the field of human genomics have undeniably helped speed up the entire process. After the publication of the human genome, Dr Venter turned his attention to another grand project: the creation of a synthetic life form. Scientists at the US-based J Craig Venter Institute have been busily working on the endeavour for more than a decade. They have now published details of the result, an organism called Synthia, in the prestigious journal Science. Born in 1946, as a boy, Dr Venter did not exemplify good scholarship and at 18 he chose to devote his life to the surfing pleasures of the beaches in Southern California. Three years later, in 1967, he was drafted into the Vietnam conflict. As an orderly in the naval field hospital at Da Nang, he tended to thousands of soldiers wounded during the Tet offensive. This inspired two important changes in him: a determination to become a doctor and a conviction that time should never be wasted. \"Life was so cheap in Vietnam. That is where my sense of urgency comes from,\" he said. During his medical training he excelled in research rather than practice. By the 1980s, the early days of the revolution in molecular biology, he was working at the government-funded US National Institute of Health and soon realised the importance of decoding genes. But the work was messy, tedious and agonisingly slow. So, in 1987, when he read reports of an automated decoding machine, he soon had the first one in his lab. This speeded things up - but not enough. Then came Dr Venter's real breakthrough. He realised that he did not need to trawl the entire genome to find the active parts, because cells already use those parts naturally. He switched his attention from the DNA blueprint to the messenger molecules (called RNA) that a cell makes from that blueprint. He was then able to churn out gene sequences at unprecedented rates. His success shocked some, most notably the co-discoverer of DNA, James Watson, who famously dismissed the relatively crude results obtained as work \"any monkey\" could do. The criticism, and the failure to secure further public research funding, prompted Dr Venter to leave the NIH in 1992 and set up a private research institute, The Institute for Genomic Research. And, in 1995, he again stunned the scientific establishment by unveiling the first, complete genome of a free-living organism, Haemophilus influenzae, a major cause of childhood ear infections and meningitis. His greatest challenge to the establishment came in May 1998, when he announced the formation of a commercial company, Celera Genomics, to crack the entire human genetic code in just three years. At that point, the public project was three years into a 10-year programme. Both efforts published their results in 2001. What some saw as Dr Venter's disregard for scientific conventions such as open access to data brought him opprobrium in some circles. Nevertheless, the financial rewards were enough to leave him in a highly unusual position for a scientist - with enough money and resources to do the science he wanted without having to tap the usual bureaucratic sources for funding and infrastructure. In 2006, he formed the J Craig Venter Institute which would spearhead the labour to create the world's first synthetic life form. Dr Venter kept the scientific journals and the media abreast of developments, trumpeting several key advances as he edged closer to his goal. But he has pursued other projects in the meantime. Dr Venter has roamed the oceans in his yacht, Sorcerer II, collecting life forms in an unprecedented genetic treasure hunt. The project aims to sequence genomes from the vast range of microbes living in the sea, to provide scientists with a better understanding of the evolution and function of genes and proteins. The synthetic life breakthrough, when it was announced, was not without controversy. But Dr Venter will have come to expect that. \"I think they're going to potentially create a new industrial revolution,\" he said of the synthetic microbes. \"If we can really get cells to do the production that we want, they could help wean us off oil and reverse some of the damage to the environment by capturing carbon dioxide.\"",

Venter's work has been driven by a sense of urgency and a desire to revolutionize the field of medicine, which he believes is too slow and inefficient.

Ministers want all pupils in England to study maths, English, science, one of history or geography and a modern language at GCSE. But some young people \"will find it a problem\" Sir Michael Wilshaw, told the Times Educational Supplement (TES). Sir Michael said vocational subjects would suit some pupils better. In particular he questioned whether the academic subjects included in the government's Ebacc would be the best thing for pupils who wanted to take apprenticeships when they left school. \"I can think of youngsters, even at the highest-performing schools, who will find it a problem and who would have been better suited to do English, maths and science and a range of vocational subjects,\" he told the magazine. In June, the Education Secretary Nicky Morgan confirmed she wants all pupils to have to study the five traditional subjects included in the Ebacc school performance measure. According to Mrs Morgan the move would ensure all pupils received a rigorous academic education and avoid pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds being put off academic subjects. In addition, the Conservative manifesto pledges that schools which do not have 100% of pupils studying this set of subjects at GCSE should not be able to obtain Ofsted's top rating of \"outstanding\". Both policies will be subject to a government consultation later in the autumn. Sir Michael told the TES he agreed more young people should be studying these subjects - but said the combination was not suitable for everyone. The Association of School and College Leaders, which represents secondary heads, welcomed Sir Michael's challenge to government policy. General Secretary Brian Lightman said the union shared his concerns. He said a recent survey by the union found almost 90% of school leaders disagreed with making these subjects compulsory for all pupils. \"It is unfair on young people to take a one-size-fits-all approach to their education. \"We are concerned that creative, technology and vocational subjects will be squeezed out of the curriculum.\" Mr Lightman said the union would urge ministers to make the choice of GCSE subjects more flexible. The Department for Education said an additional league table measure, Progress 8, allows pupils to study a wider range of subjects. \"As part of Progress 8, pupils will be able to study up to three of our new gold-standard Tech Awards which will provide a real foundation for progression on to vocational courses including apprenticeships,\" said a spokesman.",

Alesha O'Connor, Rhodri Miller, Corey Price, all 17 and from Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, and Margaret Challis, 66, from Merthyr Tydfil, were killed near Storey Arms, Brecon, in March 2015. The Aberdare inquest heard Rhodri was driving the teenagers in one car. The coroner concluded all four died as a result of a road traffic accident. The inquest was told Rhodri's car was one of seven vehicles in a convoy going on a drive from Barry on the night of 6 March. Rhys Hunter, a passenger in the car, said Rhodri had passed his test a few days earlier. He said before the group set off someone warned him \"be careful, we're on a mountain\" and at one point during the journey the driver ran a red light. Minutes before the crash, Mr Hunter took a picture and the speedometer in the car he was in showed 75 mph (120km/h). But Mr Hunter said Rhodri was not trying to catch up with the vehicle in front of him and had not been trying to overtake another vehicle. \"Rhodri started to lose control and we collided with the other car,\" he said. \"I'm not sure why it happened or why the car was out of control. Probably because of the way it was driven.\" Joseph Fetter, who was driving behind Rhodri's car, said he was driving consistently around five car lengths behind and no racing had taken place, but he had seen Rhodri's brake lights come on several times. \"I think it was inexperience that made him lose control,\" he said. \"I wasn't pushing him on - I didn't know the road at all. It was dark.\" Passengers in some of the other vehicles said Rhodri was not overtaking but did lose control of his car on the bend, swerving from one side of the road to the other. But survivor Emlyn Williams, who was in the other car involved in the crash along with friend Mrs Challis, disputed some of the evidence. \"The car was coming down by a bend. I saw another car overtaking it. The car hit me, that was it,\" he said. \"The only thing I knew was a bang, the windscreen broke and the airbag came out. \"I tried to get out and see to Mrs Challis. I went to the other car. It was quiet, silent. There was no opportunity to steer out of the way.\" Drivers and passengers in vehicles travelling in the direction of Merthyr Tydfil described in police statements seeing the cars leave a lay-by at Storey Arms minutes before the collision. The inquest was told they pulled out too quickly and too close to each other. One witness said: \"Boy racers. It's obvious they were on a mission.\" Dyfed-Powys Police Insp Gary Jones told the inquest messages found on mobile phones showed those in the convoy had discussed speed. One read: \"It's madness. Everyone's racing there are 9 cars\" while another read \"why would I want to go along cars with turbos - I'll be the slowest there\". PC David Stacey, who investigated what had happened, said it was \"like nothing I had seen in 20 years service. It was a distressing scene\". He told the inquest he believed what Mr Williams had seen was Rhodri's car out of control, possibly caused by approaching the unmarked bend at too high a speed and braking in the turn, but not overtaking. Rhodri and Corey were pronounced dead at the scene while Alesha and Mrs Challis died at Prince Charles Hospital, Merthyr. The inquest heard new road signs had since been put in place on that section of road but the coroner recommended that signage should warn about the upcoming bend. In a statement, Rhodri's family described their son as \"the child every parent would dream of\", adding: \"Our hearts have been ripped out, and nothing is the same.\" The family said they would like to see lessons learned and for young drivers to be made to realise the implications of serious car accidents in the same way as those who are caught speeding do.

        "article": "Midwives in Northern Ireland staged a four-hour strike from 08:00 BST and 12:00 BST on Thursday in a pay dispute. The strike is over a 1% pay rise that was awarded last year to all midwives in England, Scotland and Wales. The Department of Health said officials worked to ensure a safe service was provided during the stoppage. It said midwives in Northern Ireland had the same settlement as colleagues in England. \"While we would like to be in a position to have done more in 2014/15, it is important to recognise midwives and other non-medical staff received a minimum of 1% extra with the average rise through incremental progression being 3.7% and some staff receiving 6.7% more,\" a spokesperson said. While the most senior midwives in Northern Ireland got the rise in a one-off payment last March, those on lower pay bands did not. Instead, most received the annual uplift of around \u00c2\u00a31,500. According to the Royal College of Midwives (RCM), all midwives should receive the 1% increase like elsewhere in the UK, regardless of their band, as well as the uplift in salary that is built in to the pay system. It has emerged that talks resumed on Tuesday between the Department of Health and some of the health unions. While those negotiations have been described as positive, further industrial action is planned, including claiming for all overtime. Amy Leversidge of the RCM said the department was \"being cheeky\" to suggest that midwives in Northern Ireland had received the same pay rise as their English colleagues. She said staff on higher pay bands had received a 1% \"temporary uplift\" to their basic pay in February, but at the start of the financial year in April, their pay went back to 2013 levels. Incremental progression based on experience and performance was a part of the NHS pay structure rather than a pay rise, the union's employment relations adviser said. \"We don't want to wait until February 2016 to find out what's happening - we want to negotiate a solution now,\" she said. Midwife Hazel McAllister told the BBC: \"We are not any less passionate, caring or hard-working than colleagues in other parts of the UK who have gained this 1% pay rise. \"We feel very undervalued by the powers-that-be who have refused to pay this. \"I have been a midwife for 37 years - it's a fantastic profession but I would worry about its future.\"",

The disease can be more serious and harder to treat than conventional, human tuberculosis. The world has committed to being free of tuberculosis by 2035. But bodies including the World Health Organization (WHO) say animal TB has been neglected for decades. Raw or unpasteurised milk is one of the most common sources of the infection. But animal tuberculosis - officially known as zoonotic tuberculosis - also affects those in close contact with infected animals including vets, farmers and butchers. Dr Francisco Olea-Popelka, from the Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease, said zoonotic tuberculosis was \"far more common than previously recognised\". The best estimates suggest there are around 121,000 new cases of animal TB each year. The figure is tiny compared to human TB, which is the biggest lethal infection in the world. But Dr Olea-Popelka told the BBC News website: \"I think we should care.\" \"This is a well-known problem and has been neglected for decades, it is a disease that is preventable, treatable and curable and yet still today we have hundreds of thousands of people suffering from it. \"Ten thousand die every year from this disease, that's a lot of cases compared to many other diseases, why not care?\" he added. He is part of a group - including the WHO, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization and the Stop TB Partnership - that has published a call to action in the Lancet Infectious Diseases medical journal. One of the biggest issues the report raises is the unknown scale of the problem. Studies in Mexico suggest 28% of all tuberculosis cases are down to zoonotic TB but a study in India put the figure at 9% and one in children in California suggested a figure of 45%. Dr Paula Fujiwara, from the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease, added: \"With approximately nine million individuals contracting TB globally each year, even relatively low percentages of zoonotic TB lead to large numbers of people suffering from this form of the disease.\" \"People living with zoonotic TB require specialized care, but in the vast majority of cases, they are not even adequately diagnosed,\" she added. Animal TB is caused by Mycobacterium bovis, which is a different infection to human TB caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. M. bovis is inherently resistant to one of the key drugs used to treat human TB - pyrazinamide. And Dr Olea-Popelka added: \"Once you get zoonotic TB it is often extrapulmonary TB, meaning it is not only in the lungs, but in other organs; that complicates the diagnosis and makes it more difficult to treat.\" How to tackle animal tuberculosis will be one of the themes of the Union World Conference on Lung Health taking place later this month. Dr Olea-Popelka said the key strategies for preventing zoonotic were: Each is easier said than done. Follow James on Twitter.",

Robbie Parry slotted the Welsh visitors into a half time lead as the rain lashed down in West Lothian. Steven Saunders doubled the advantage from close range on 58 minutes before Quigley curled in a wonderful strike. As Livingston toiled to make inroads in attack, TNS passed up chances to make their victory even more comfortable. The runaway Welsh Premier League leaders, on their way to sixth successive title, now join Scottish Championship trio Dundee United, Queen of the South and St Mirren in Monday's draw. TNS were content to sit back for long spells, with Scottish League One leaders Livi finding it hard to get a glimpse of goal. When they did, Raffaele De Vita headed straight at goalkeeper Paul Harrison and then shot over from a tight angle before Liam Buchanan sent an angled strike narrowly wide. The visitors went ahead on 36 minutes when Simon Spender cut in from the right and his blocked shot fell to Parry, who calmly picked his spot with a first-time finish. Livi improved for a brief spell at the start of the second half, with Buchanan slamming a shot into the side-netting shortly after Harrison had done well to push away a strong header from De Vita. TNS moved further ahead from a corner as the home side cleared off the line but the ball was sent back into the danger area and an unmarked Saunders scuffed home from inside the six yard box. The contest was over when Quigley cut in from right and arced a sweet shot into the opposite top corner with his left from junction of the penalty box. Late on, Christian Sergeant broke clear of the ragged Livi defence and looked certain to score but keeper Gary Maley got a slight touch on his chipped effort to slow the ball down, with Michael Miller sliding in to complete the clearance. Maley had to look lively again, pushing over a rising shot from Parry as TNS ended the evening well on top. TNS's Craig Harrison: \"It was very tough physically but we matched them. Overall, it was a very professional performance and we were ruthless in the final third. \"We have a strong squad and we go into every competition wanting to win it. The whole club, from top to bottom, has that mentality.

        "article": "Limiting in-work benefits to new EU arrivals will help tackle the effects of record migration to the UK since 2004, the EC's president has said. Jean-Claude Juncker said the UK imposed no migration controls on eight central European and Baltic nations joining the EU in 2004 and the new proposals would \"address the consequences\" of that. But he said the emergency brake would only apply in \"exceptional cases\". Eurosceptics say it is ineffectual and could make the situation worse. Speaking in the European Parliament, UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the plan was a \"handbrake turn\" by David Cameron. The prime minister has hailed a plan to allow the UK to limit the amount of tax credits paid to new EU migrants for up to four years as one of the key elements of a draft package of reforms to the UK's membership of the EU - the details of which he will set out to the UK Parliament later. He has said the emergency brake, which would take effect if it could be proven that high levels of migration were putting an extreme strain on the UK's benefits system, could be triggered almost immediately. But many Tory MPs have criticised the plan, saying it is a watered-down version of the total four-year ban the PM was hoping for and that new migrants would still receive \"graduated\" rates of in-work benefits over the four year period and the full amount after that. They are also unhappy that the brake would have to be approved by other EU nations and the UK could not apply it unilaterally. Defending the proposals and the rest of the draft deal in the European Parliament, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said that the entire package - which must be approved by the EU as a whole, was \"fair to the UK and fair to the other 27 EU states\". On welfare, he said: \"We propose to create a safeguard mechanism tailor-made to the concerns of the UK, that would allow it to restrict the excess of EU workers newly entering its Labour market to in-work benefits in a graduated manner for a period of up to four years. \"The duration of the mechanism will be limited in time - that is a crucial characteristic of a safeguard mechanism, necessary to make it compatible with the (EU) treaties. It will apply in exceptional cases as all derogrations from the freedoms (of movement rules) should.\" Mr Juncker pointed out that the then Labour government had had the option to introduce transitional controls on migration when countries such as Poland and Hungary entered the EU in 2004 but, unlike Germany, decided against doing so. One of the most controversial decisions of Tony Blair's time in office, several former Labour ministers have since said it was a mistake and acknowledged the government hugely underestimated the number of people who would come to the UK. Mr Juncker said \"as a result\" of that decision \"over the past decade, the UK attracted a record number of mobile EU citizens\". He added. \"In effect, we will enable the UK to use the safeguards mechanism to address the consequences of that decision.\" But UKIP leader Nigel Farage, also speaking in the European Parliament, said the safeguards were totally insubstantial and would not allow the UK to reduce levels of annual net migration, which rose to 336,000 in the year to June 2015. \"We have an emergency brake on migrants benefits. Wow. It was supposed to be a total ban on migrants benefits for four years. So it is hardly an emergency brake, it is more of a handbrake turn.\" Mr Farage said Mr Cameron would not be able to get any further concessions out of the EU and the forthcoming referendum on the UK's future in the EU would be a battle between \"vested self-interests and people power\". Former Belgian prime minister Guy Verhofstadt, who is now a leading MEP, suggested that if the UK voted to leave the EU, it would be a boost for Russia and China. \"I think Britain without Europe - ok it's a dwarf, let's be honest,\" he claimed. \"We Belgians, we know that we are dwarfs but maybe they're going to know it also. And at the other hand Europe without Great Britain, yes, doesn't count, is not a counterweight against China, against Russia, against the United States. \"It is Vladimir Putin, in fact, who wins in this game in the end because Putin likes a divided Europe.\"",

        "article": "England hammered home their advantage over Australia in the first Test on a fast-moving third day to put themselves in pole position to take the lead in the Ashes. The hosts claimed Australia's last five wickets for 44 runs on Friday morning to bowl them out for 308 and secure a first-innings lead of 122. Ian Bell and Joe Root both scored 60 and Ben Stokes 42 as England surged further ahead in the afternoon session to the delight of a buoyant Cardiff crowd. And although wickets fell regularly in a frenetic finale, Mark Wood's unbeaten 32 helped England reach 289 all out to set Australia an improbable 412 to win. Only two teams in Test history have successfully chased that many runs, with Australia's best effort the 404-3 by Don Bradman's 'Invincibles' at Headingley in 1948. England set the tone for a near-perfect day with an electric performance on the third morning, executing their plans to perfection to finish off the Australia innings. Shane Watson's vulnerability to lbws was brilliantly exploited as Stuart Broad dismissed him for 30 in the second over of the day before Wood pinned Nathan Lyon in front of his stumps. James Anderson found swing with the new ball to induce edges from Brad Haddin and Mitchell Starc, with Broad removing Mitchell Johnson in between. In little more than an hour, England had advanced from a position of relative strength to one of total control. After a nervy start with the bat - failures for Alastair Cook and Gary Ballance left England teetering on 22-2 - their second innings found momentum. Adam Lyth showed his mettle with a fluent 37, but the main catalyst was Bell, who put a dreadful sequence of 56 runs in nine innings behind him with a fine half-century. The Warwickshire batsman went on the front foot from the off, lashing two cover drives in one Mitchell Starc over and peppering the third-man boundary with his trademark late cut. He reached fifty off 75 balls, and underlined his new-found confidence by crashing Johnson over cover for his 11th four. The next ball brought Bell's undoing however, as, clearly expecting the short ball, he backed away slightly and was clean bowled to give Johnson his first wicket of the match. By the time of Bell's dismissal, England were flying and the in-form duo of Root and Stokes kept them airborne, with both finding the boundary nine times. A mini-collapse from 207-4 to 245-8 in the last session gave Australia a glimmer of hope, only for England to find inspiration from an unlikely source. Swinging from the hip, Wood took the lead role in a 43-run partnership for the ninth wicket with Moeen Ali and was still at the crease when Anderson became Lyon's fourth victim in the very last action of the day. England's brilliance has set up the possibility of a four-day finish, and the hosts would be wise to do their utmost to wrap things up on Saturday because of heavy showers forecast for Sunday. Australia will no doubt still fancy their chances of pulling off a record-breaking victory, but in reality the Welsh weather represents their best chance of avoiding going into next week's second Test at Lord's 1-0 down. Australia spinner Nathan Lyon: \"We're definitely still in it. If we bat two days the result will go our way. There's no reason why we can't dig deep. \"We've got to learn from our first innings with the bat - be more patient. There were too many 30s in the first innings, so we need to try and push on a bit more and have a couple of our top five get big hundreds.\" England batsman Ian Bell: \"There are no gimmes and we expect more tomorrow. We are going to have to work hard to win.\"",

        "article": "A boosted youth vote is believed to have contributed to Labour's shock election result, but what made young people turn out to vote? In 2015, voter turnout among 18- to 24-year-olds was estimated to be 43%, compared with a 66.1% turnout overall. This year, YouGov puts the youth turnout at 58%. Polling traditionally shows that a majority of young people vote Labour.  This year, the proportion has jumped to 63% for 18-29-year-olds, according to YouGov. So how did this change happen? Sam Jeffers, co-founder of Who Targets Me, which monitored the use of social media adverts by the political parties during the general election, said it seemed clear that Labour defeated the Conservatives in the social media battle. Labour's adverts had consistently been shared more widely by social media users, he said. Part of this appears to be down to the difference in tone of the adverts. While the Conservatives had almost entirely focused their adverts on the strength of Prime Minister Theresa May and the weakness of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, Labour's social media adverts had been more positive, seeking to emphasise that the party was building a social movement, he said. And this had been combined with the repeated use of adverts with practical messages designed to increase youth voter turnout by giving instructions on how to register to vote and where to find local polling stations. Adverts also appeared to have been released on specific days on the basis that their message was likely to cut through for only a limited amount of time, Mr Jeffers said. For example, Labour had invested heavily on adverts attacking the Tories' so-called \"dementia tax\" on social care costs, days before the 8 June election. The aim of this appeared to be to suppress the older, potentially Conservative, vote or get them to switch to Labour at the last minute, Mr Jeffers said. Labour also focused its attention on more of the UK, targeting 464 constituencies in the final two days of the election campaign. The Tories targeted 205. Was it Facebook wot swung it? While the Labour Party paid for targeted adverts on social media, Momentum - the group that was set up to support Mr Corbyn's leadership bid and now campaigns for Labour - had a different social media strategy. Rather than pay for advertising, it instead sought to create content it hoped social media users would share voluntarily. The group created videos - many of them parodies - it hoped would become viral. These included Daddy, why do you hate me? - a mock political broadcast telling people to vote for Theresa May \"because your children deserve worse\" - which Momentum says has been viewed more than 7.6 million times across social media platforms. Its Facebook and Twitter pages feature a mixture of content, from posts mocking Theresa May's record to videos of Mr Corbyn hugging some of his supporters. Joe Todd, from Momentum, said the group had felt its strategy was working when it had realised many of the people sharing its content were not typical supporters of Mr Corbyn. Increasingly, users liking its Facebook page had been people who also liked the pages of TV programmes not known for their political audiences, such as Ant and Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway and Match of the Day, he said. \"We were breaking out of the leftie bubble,\" Mr Todd said. Using message services to reach the young - and in some cases mobilising them into an army of potential canvassers - had been important in reaching the youth vote, Mr Todd said. Momentum says it reached some 400,000 people through the messaging platform WhatsApp, which data shows is used most by 18-to 29-year-olds, in the UK. The group also set up mynearestmarginal.com - a website that enables activists to pool together, and often lift share, to canvass in marginal seats. Momentum says the website was used by about 100,000 people - more than four times as many as its 24,000 membership. This meant young people with no experience of canvassing could team up with those with previous election experience for targeted canvassing. \"If you have a young person telling another young person, 'You should get out and vote because this election is important', it's more convincing,\" Mr Todd said. There was also an unashamed pitch for the youth vote at the heart of Labour's manifesto For the Many, Not the Few - and that was the eye-catching promise of scrapping tuition fees for university students and the pledge to reintroduce their maintenance grants. Further policies pitched with the young in mind included the ending of zero-hour contracts and unpaid internships, a rise in the minimum wage, and a pledge to build more than one million homes. Of course, Labour wasn't the only party that targeted young people and it's hard to quantify the effect of the manifesto in getting the young out to vote, but Mr Todd felt it was among the most significant factors. \"It conjured up a sense of hope,\" he said. The Labour campaign also featured large rallies that accompanied Jeremy Corbyn's speeches around the country. Mr Corbyn had been a long-standing supporter of the protest movement, and the veteran anti-war campaigner was well placed to appeal to a growing number of young people who had become engaged in politics through these movements, according to Sam Fairbairn, national secretary of the People's Assembly protest group. Although the People's Assembly does not endorse individual parties or candidates, Mr Fairbairn said the group - and its numerous local affiliates and sister organisations - had encouraged members to join Mr Corbyn's campaign rallies. \"It's no accident Jeremy has been part of these movements since he's been in politics. This is how many young people have got into politics in the last 10 years,\" Mr Fairbairn said. \"What we saw was the result of the work all these movements have done.\" A string of endorsements from anti-establishment celebrities and musicians, including from the world of grime - a genre of music that blends garage and jungle and  has a Jamaican influence - also, arguably, further bolstered Mr Corbyn's youth credentials. Mr Corbyn also took part in interviews with outlets - such as rock magazines NME and Kerrang, and football YouTube channel Copa90 - outside of the political mainstream that were more likely to reach younger audiences. Becka Hudson, from the #Grime4Corbyn campaign, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme Mr Corbyn had \"offered young people a programme they can believe in and a better future\". The question is what happens next with that youth support. Is there the danger the young will be discouraged by the election result and be less likely to turn out at the next election, whenever that may be? Mr Todd thinks the opposite is the case. \"For most people this project was something they believed in, but it seemed like it might not be possible. Now the prospect of victory is really realistic,\" he said.",

The takeover sees 100% of the club's shares and assets transferred from previous owner Steve Morgan to Fosun in a deal thought to be worth \u00a345m. In an open letter to supporters, Morgan said Fosun had \"made a commitment to invest between \u00a320-\u00a330m over the next two years\" into the club. Chief executive Jez Moxey will also step down after 16 years at Molineux. Wolves, who had been put up for sale by Morgan in September 2015, are the second Championship club to have Chinese owners after Midlands rivals Aston Villa were sold to Dr Tony Xia earlier this year. The new-look board at Molineux will consist of four members, including Jeff Shi, who led the negotiations on behalf of Fosun and will become the club's representative, while local businessmen and Wolves supporters John Bowater and John Gough will also continue to serve as non-executive board members. Moxey will remain as chief executive for the next three months as the club, which finished 14th in the Championship in 2015-16, search for a permanent replacement. \"We are delighted to have completed the deal to become the new owners of such a famous and historic club as Wolves,\" Shi told the club's official website. \"We owe a great debt of gratitude to Steve Morgan for taking such good care of the club and for placing his trust in us to become the new custodians of Wolves. \"During our conversations Steve's great passion and vision for the club and Wolverhampton was very clear and we feel privileged to pick up the baton from him. \"And also to Jez Moxey for his tremendous contribution to Wolves. We are sad to see him leave.\" Shi continued: \"We would also like to thank the hugely loyal and passionate Wolves supporters, and all of the club staff, for their patience whilst our discussions were ongoing. We hope they will be pleased with, and supportive of, our exciting plans for Wolves. \"Our goal is crystal clear: we will do our very best to help take Wolves back to the Premier League as soon as possible and to stay there. \"We believe the club and the fans belong at the top of English football and getting there is our first and top priority.\" Under the chairmanship of billionaire businessman Guo Guangchang, Fosun are one of the largest investment groups in China. They have stakes in various leisure and entertainment projects around the world, including Club Med and Cirque du Soleil, and currently have interests in several UK companies including Thomas Cook. Fosun also has links with super-agent Jorge Mendes, who represents Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho and Real Madrid striker Cristiano Ronaldo among others. Mendes sold a minority share of his agency Gestifute to a subsidiary of Fosun late in 2015 and is expected to play a part in recruitment at Wolves. I don't think there's any significance in the West Midlands suddenly appearing to be the hotbed of Chinese interest as far as English football's concerned. Two factors have combined - the Chinese government encouraging its big economic players to get involved in European football and the stagnant state of the top West Midlands clubs. Since Aston Villa's League Cup win in 1996 only Birmingham City have won one of English football's major trophies, beating Arsenal to win the same competition in 2011. Too many false dawns, too many disillusioned owners. A regional powerhouse stagnating. Enter the Chinese on the wave of a massive interest in football, with their own Super League prospering, serious players being lured by fabulous contracts and TV coverage of English football soaring in scope. The president has said he wants the World Cup staged in China within 20 years. The onward march into English football - and stakes in Atletico Madrid and AC Milan - is just one manifestation of that long-term aim. The money is available to snap up these West Midlands clubs. Other bidders are just being blown out of the water by Chinese money.",

        "article": "Sales of British salmon helped the UK to export a record value of food and drink in the first half of the year, according to industry figures. Exports of the fish jumped more than 53% by value to \u00a3408m, the Food and Drink Federation (FDF) said. UK food and drink exports rose 8.5% to \u00a310.2bn, helped by the fall in the pound after last year's Brexit vote. But the FDF warned that without a favourable Brexit trade deal, British exports could become less competitive. Whisky remained the top export, while salmon was second, and beer rose to third, overtaking chocolate. But while the volume of salmon exports rose by 24%, whisky exports actually fell 1% by volume, and beer exports fell 2.2%. The pound has fallen sharply against the dollar and euro since the UK voted to leave the EU in June last year, giving a boost to UK exports, as they have become relatively cheaper. However, the weaker pound has also pushed up costs for British businesses that bring in food and raw materials from abroad, the FDF said. It said the UK's food and drink trade deficit - the difference between how much the UK imports and exports - widened 16% to \u00a312.4bn over the period. British salmon is becoming more popular globally, according to Andy Bing, sales director of Loch Duart Salmon in North West Scotland. \"This half we've sold more than we ever have,\" he said, adding that the firm's main export markets were France, the US, Italy, and Switzerland. UK salmon exports have grown after Chilean producers suffered problems in 2015 with algal blooms that killed a large amount of their fish, he said. Looking ahead, the firm is optimistic about the eventual post-Brexit trade deals that can be struck with EU countries. \"Europe needs lovely Scottish salmon just as we need lovely French wine and wonderful German cars,\" he said. However, he added that Loch Duart was \"finding it difficult to plan without better guidance\" from the government about Brexit. The two biggest importers of UK food and drink are Ireland and France. If there is no deal and World Trade Organization (WTO) tariffs with the EU are brought in, \"food and drink would face significantly higher tariffs than most other products,\" an FDF spokesman said. For example, some fruit and vegetables would face tariffs of 157%, and for some drinks products, importers would have to pay 152% tariffs. Goods \"could face lengthy delays at border for checks and inspections that would add delays and cost to products, particularly those with short shelf lives,\" the spokesman added. However, the free market think tank, the Institute for Economic Affairs, said it would not be a \"disaster\" if the UK failed to strike a deal with the EU. Jamie Whyte, IEA research director, said: \"In fact, we could unilaterally eliminate all import tariffs, which would give us most of the benefits of trade and export to the EU under the umbrella of the WTO rules.\" A UK government spokesman said it wanted to reach a deal with the EU \"allowing for the most frictionless trade including in food and drink as possible\". Source HM Customs and Excise In the first half of the year, UK food and drink exports rose faster to EU countries, up 9%, than to countries outside the EU, with growth of 7.6%. But the market which saw the most growth in the first half was South Korea, up 77%, in the main due to beer exports. Food Minister George Eustice said: \"We have ambitious plans to produce and export more of our fabulous foods around the world and more businesses are trying exporting for the first time. \"Last week we announced further market access to China for pork producers and UK beef will soon be heading to the Philippines. We will continue to work with industry to open new opportunities.\"",

        "article": "A 94-year-old man who survived a prisoner of war camp next door to the Auschwitz-Birkenau extermination camp believes a football league which the guards allowed them to set up may have helped save his life. As Ron Jones, from Newport, prepares to mark Holocaust Memorial Day on Friday with a service at the city's cathedral, he says that amongst all the terrible memories, there will also be a few which will make him smile. He was captured in 1943 fighting in the Middle East, and after nine months in Italy, was transferred to forced labour camp E715, part of the Auschwitz complex. There he spent 12 hours a day, six days a week, working with hazardous chemicals in the IG Farben works, but on Sundays they were permitted to play football. \"I think the Germans thought that letting us play football was a quick and easy way of keeping us quiet,\" he said. \"The Red Cross would bring us food parcels, and when they heard about our football, they managed to get us strips for four teams: England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland. I was always the Wales goalkeeper. \"It kept us sane, it was a bit of normality, but it sounds wrong somehow to say I've got fond memories of playing football, considering what was going on just over the fence.\" He says as well as keeping up spirits, football played a major role in his survival, and that of many of his fellow prisoners, when they were forced on one of the series of extremely long marches westwards from PoW camps during the final stages of the conflict. Whilst many of Mr Jones's friends died on the march, he believes it is no coincidence that those who had been involved in the Auschwitz football league fared better. \"You could say the football we'd played saved our lives. The football lads were fitter, yes, but more than that, they belonged to a group which kept each other going on the march.\" E715 was located close to Auschwitz III, Monowitz, which held mainly Polish resistance fighters, political dissidents, homosexuals and some captured Soviet troops. Whilst this was not officially a death camp, Mr Jones says it did not take long for him to realise that the inmates at Monowitz were far from safe. \"In the nights you could hear shots coming from Monowitz,\" he said. \"Not bursts like you had when you were fighting, but deliberate, regular every few seconds; like they had a system going. \"We didn't know who they were or why they'd been killed, and we couldn't help but be terrified that we'd be next.\" But when the British PoWs were allowed out to play football, they would be taken to fields next to Auschwitz II, Birkenau, where killing was on an altogether more industrial scale. \"The first Sunday we went to the playing fields, we saw these people - well walking skeletons they were really - digging trenches,\" he said. \"We asked, 'Who are those poor sods?' and the German guards shout 'Juden', Jews, as if it had been a stupid question. \"We could only play in the summer, because everything was covered in snow through the winter. But when it was hot, this awful stench would waft across from the crematoriums. \"Your imaginations pretty much filled in the gaps for you, but we'd carry on playing football. \"Scoring a goal, making a save or arguing about an offside was the only way you could stop yourself from cracking up.\" Mr Jones says he has spent a great deal of time since the war wondering about how much his German guards had known and cared about what was going on inside Birkenau. \"You have to remember that our guards weren't SS like in Birkenau; they were conscripted squaddies like us,\" he said. \"Dozens of them would come and cheer our football matches and have a laugh with us, and if you got them on their own, you could tell that they were ordinary, decent blokes. \"But if you asked them about Birkenau they'd get angry and scared. 'We didn't need to know', 'they didn't know', 'it was nothing', and even if it was, then 'it wasn't their fault, they weren't SS'.\" \"I had nightmares about Auschwitz for years after the war, but I bet mine were nothing compared with what those Germans must have gone through. \"Some would say they deserve it, but most likely they couldn't have done any more about it than we could have ourselves.\" As the Red Army closed in, on 21 January, 1945 German guards burst into Mr Jones's hut in the middle of the night, and ordered him to leave immediately with whatever he could carry. The Soviets liberated Auschwitz on 27 January, 1945, confirming for the first time the stories of the Holocaust's mass murder, which the Allies had hitherto rubbished as too extreme to be possible. But by the time the Russians arrived, Mr Jones was long gone; as part of the death march west, which killed anywhere between 3,000 and 8,000 Allied PoWs. \"We were on the road for 17 weeks, and God knows how many hundreds of miles we traipsed, through Poland, Czechoslovakia, Germany and Austria.\" \"I was 13 stone (82kg) when I was captured, and when I was liberated by the Americans in April 1945, they weighed me, and I was seven stone.\" Mr Jones considers himself one of the lucky ones. \"I was very lucky. I came home to a good wife, who helped me get over it. But lots never really recovered at all,\" he said. \"I think I'm probably the last now. There was another of the footballers who I got Christmas cards from, but there was nothing this year. So at 94, I think it's probably time to tell the story before it's too late.\"",

A director of the Chartered Trading Standards Institute said that local authorities are forced to make a \"wicked\" choice between what services they provide because of austerity. Adam Scorer was speaking after it emerged that the Grenfell Tower fire started in a Hotpoint fridge-freezer. Some 79 people are feared dead. He told 5 Live's Wake Up to Money that while councils were responsible for trading standards, there was no central system to relay information about products to the public. \"Consumers should be confident that most products are safe, but we do know that the regime is as strong as its weakest link,\" Mr Scorer said. \"We don't have a central organisation of technical resources, we don't have core funding where we can be sure of who is going to be around to do this testing, and we don't have the right level of strategic communication to make sure that risks are placed on the system, flags are alerted and people are able to go in and do the right level of investigation of all the products that are concerned.\" Former Business Secretary Sir Vince Cable told the programme that trading standards were a problem area because they were not a statutory obligation of local government. \"There are some things local government is required to do - trading standards not so,\" he said. \"So when local councils are under financial pressure it is something they can cut back on.\" Although the Department of Business provides \u00c2\u00a315m annually for national trading standards activities, the vast majority of services are funded by local authorities. The departments were once known as Weights and Measures. Sir Vince suggested imposing an obligation on local authorities to strengthen trading standards, adding: \"Or you could give them some financial support, which I think is what we should be probably doing, to have some ring-fenced money that supports what is currently a declining service.\" He was Business Secretary when former BBC presenter Lynn Faulds-Wood was commissioned to investigate product safety. She claims the government ignored her report. \"I think Lynn Faulds-Wood's concern is she made recommendations that were very modest and did not entail public cost, [but] even they have not been acted on and that was where she is enormously frustrated.\" Sir Vince added: \"There is a tendency at the moment to look at whether the costs are to business rather than whether the costs are to society as a whole.\" A Department for Business spokesperson said: \"Funding and prioritisation for trading standards are decisions for local authorities - accountable to local communities and the people they serve. Government recognises that consumer protection goes beyond local authority boundaries, which is why we provide \u00c2\u00a315m per year for coordinated Trading Standards activity in the UK.\"",

We have to see games out.\" Cardiff have conceded almost 30% of their goals between 80-90 minutes this season, including in their last three games. The Bluebirds were held by Birmingham last time out as Lukas Jutkiewicz bundled in a rebound after his header was saved. Cardiff also conceded an injury-time equaliser against Blackburn, while defeat at QPR in their previous fixture came courtesy of an 83rd-minute own goal by Jazz Richards. \"The last couple of games we have controlled and then let slip right at the end,\" said Morrison. \"We need to learn lessons now for next season, which is what the gaffer is trying to build on, finishing well this year.\" Morrison also says the whole team has a responsibility to improve their \"game management\". \"It does start from the front, it is not just the defenders and a goalkeeper,\" he said. \"It is game management, one of the boys made a good point yesterday. He said 'we can win a game 1-0'. \"You don't have to win two or three; you don't get any more points for scoring an extra goal. \"And there are certain periods in the game we just need to see it out. \"That nous and knowhow is down to us, the players.

However, Morrison believes knowing that Warnock has grand plans to strengthen City is only going to have a positive effect on the current squad. \"We know there will probably be new faces next year so it is about building a solid base to give it a right good go. \"Maybe we are driven by knowing new players are coming in.

At least 60 people were injured when Iraqi troops drove back thousands of mainly Shia Muslims protesting against corruption and security failures. Soldiers fired real and rubber bullets at the protesters, as well as tear gas. Some reports, citing hospital sources, said four people had been killed and 90 injured in the clashes. On Saturday two coffins draped in flags were driven through part of the city, flanked by mourners. Iraqi President Fuad Masum called on protesters to \"abide by the law and apply self-restraint\". In a statement published on the presidency website, Mr Masum said violent rallies would distract security forces from preventing terror attacks. It was the second time this month that protesters managed to break into the city's government area. Shia Muslim cleric Moqtada Sadr condemned the use of force by the police, and voiced support for the demonstrators' \"peaceful [and] spontaneous revolt\". The protesters accuse the government of neglecting much needed reforms, as it struggles with its campaign against the so-called Islamic State group (IS) and declining oil revenues. The Sunni jihadist group controls parts of western and northern Iraq and has been behind a wave of recent attacks that have left dozens killed. Some demonstrators managed to break into the prime minister's office and parliament. Baghdad's Green Zone houses the parliament, key government buildings and many foreign embassies. The authorities later said they had completely regained control of the area and the protesters had withdrawn. The Shia cleric and his militia group, the Mehdi Army, gained prominence after the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. galvanising anti-US sentiment. Mr Sadr's followers clashed repeatedly with US forces, whose withdrawal the cleric consistently demanded. An arrest warrant was issued for Mr Sadr in 2004 in connection with the murder of a rival cleric. His militia was also blamed for the torture and killing of thousands of Sunnis in the sectarian carnage of 2006 and 2007. Mr Sadr fled to Iran during that period. In 2011, Mr Sadr returned from his self-imposed exile to Iraq, taking a more conciliatory tone and calling for Iraqi unity and peace. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, who came to power in 2014, has promised to stamp out corruption and ease sectarian tensions.

The government wants migrants to wait four years before they can claim tax credits, to reduce immigration. The aim is opposed by many EU countries - particularly in eastern Europe - who say it would be discriminatory. The PM has indicated he would consider other ways of reducing migrants' incentives, to get a deal with the EU. In a speech on 10 November, David Cameron said: \"We have proposed that people coming to Britain from the EU must live here and contribute for  four years before they qualify for in-work benefits or social housing. And that we should end the practice of sending child benefit overseas. \"Now, I understand how difficult some of these welfare issues are for other member states. And I am open to different ways of dealing with this issue.\" Options being considered are understood to include imposing the benefit curbs on Britons too, so they are non-discriminatory, or reducing the proposed amount of time migrants would have to work in the UK before they could claim benefits. But the work and pensions secretary, Iain Duncan Smith made clear his belief that the prime minister should stick to the plan to curb benefits for four years, emphasising repeatedly that this is a Conservative manifesto commitment. He also said that the UK had the private support of several EU countries in this matter. The Conservative manifesto said: \"We will insist that EU migrants who want to claim tax credits and child benefit must live here and contribute to our country for a minimum of four years. This will reduce the financial incentive for lower-paid, lower-skilled workers to come to Britain.\" Mr Duncan Smith told reporters: \"It was in our manifesto. The prime minister has made this clear. He is going to complete these discussions in the new year. He is going to present his case to the council. \"The important point, as I understand, is that the prime minister remains resolved on this matter.\" Asked what alternatives to the four-year ban he would personally be ready to accept, Mr Duncan Smith replied: \"That they agree with us. That's an alternative to the way the EU sometimes goes about its business.\" The work and pensions secretary also put further pressure on Mr Cameron by comparing his negotiations with former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's successful campaign in the 1980s to make big cuts to Britain's EU contributions. He said: \"I'm working very hard with the PM to get the deal he needs\u2026 it's early days in the process. \"It's worth also saying to people that when Mrs Thatcher went to Brussels over the budget rebate almost everybody, your predecessors, said 'it's not feasible, they won't agree it'.\" He added: \"You had a letter like this one saying 'well nothing is agreed yet' and everyone said it won't happen and then she came back with a huge budget rebate. \"My point is if you play the system hard and you go in and make very clear what you want, I'm surprised that the system itself will probably at the end of the day give you what you really need.\" Mr Duncan Smith also claimed that Britain had allies in the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark which had expressed sympathy with Britain's argument to limit welfare payments. \"Quietly, behind closed doors, they all think this is an issue in Bavaria as much as in Birmingham,\" he said. His comments follow Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, saying in a letter this week that there was \"presently no consensus\" among EU members state over the UK's planned benefit reforms.",

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the US would consider working with Russia in some areas but would stand up for its own interests. Meanwhile, US Defence Secretary James Mattis said Washington was not ready to collaborate militarily with Moscow. US President Donald Trump has called for improved ties with Moscow. But the new administration's diplomatic initiative comes as questions are raised about the Trump team's dealings with Russia dating back to last year's election campaign. US intelligence services have concluded that Moscow hacked into emails of President Donald Trump's Democratic opponents during the election. Rex Tillerson may be on a steep learning curve in the transition from oil executive to top diplomat. But the State Department press corps is also adjusting. We'd become accustomed to the garrulous John Kerry, now we have his opposite: The Quiet Man. So far Mr Tillerson has spared only a few words for us, a \"Good Morning, y'all\" as we boarded the plane in Washington. And he diligently refused to respond to questions shouted out during brief moments of press access at the beginning of his meetings in Bonn, Germany. So we gleaned what we could: he chatted about his flight with the Saudi foreign minister and about jetlag with the Turkish foreign minister. Boris Johnson, the British Foreign Secretary, made him laugh with a joke about the Commonwealth. \"Good try,\" Mr Johnson muttered as we lobbed another question, prompting more laughter but no answer. We were heartened when Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov made opening remarks, and perplexed when we were ushered out just as Mr Tillerson began to respond. He did give us a 43-second statement on Russia afterwards. And eventually a few spontaneous words as the questions continued. All in a hard day's work And three of Mr Trump's aides have been forced out over allegations about their links with Russia, including National Security Adviser Mike Flynn earlier this week. Mr Tillerson met Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on the sidelines of a G20 meeting in Germany as part of his first foreign trip in his new job. He said the US was willing to co-operate with Russia if Moscow lived up to its commitments. \"As I made clear at my Senate confirmation hearing, the United States will consider working with Russia when we can find areas of practical co-operation that will benefit the American people,\" he said. \"Where we do not see eye to eye, the United States will stand up for the interests and values of America and her allies. The secretary of state added that he expected Russia to honour its commitment to the Minsk agreements aimed at ending the conflict in Ukraine, and to work to stabilise the region. Russia's role in backing separatists in the east of the country has soured relations with the West since the conflict began in 2014. Mr Lavrov said the two sides had agreed to co-operate in areas where their interests coincided, particularly in the fight against terrorism, over Syria and in other countries in the Middle East where \"terrorism has put down roots\". However, he said that they did not discuss US sanctions against Russia, first imposed when Moscow annexed Crimea from Ukraine nearly three years ago. Mr Tillerson, who as ExxonMobil CEO was perceived to be close to the Russian leadership, told his nomination hearing in the Senate that he would consider reviewing the sanctions. Mr Tillerson also met the UK's Boris Johnson and other foreign ministers from the G20, made up of developed economies and emerging nations including China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, South Africa and Brazil. At a Nato meeting in Brussels, Gen Mattis rejected calls by Russian Defence Minister Sergey Shoigu to \"restore co-operation with the Pentagon\". \"We are not in a position right now to collaborate on a military level, but our political leaders will engage and try to find common ground or a way forward,\" he told reporters.

Five first-half Wigan scores laid the platform with two for Joe Burgess to add to tries from Sean O'Loughlin, Liam Farrell and Sam Powell. George Williams then converted his own try, and Frank Paul Nuuausala and Liam Marshall put the game beyond doubt. Salford, who have lost the past seven games. scored through Niall Evalds try.

Despite their poor form, Ian Watson's Salford are only two points behind with four games left to play in the Super 8s. Any fears that an imminent Wembley appearance would distract Wigan were blown away emphatically by a dominant performance, and a result which - in the light of dropped points for Wakefield, Hull, St Helens and Salford - keeps the Warriors well in the hunt for Old Trafford and the defence of their Super League title. England half-back Williams had a big hand in the victory, combining devastatingly in particular with winger Burgess to cause the Red Devils problems down their right edge.

Salford were a bit busted and a lot of things went our way but I'm very happy to get the win. \"I was happy with a lot of things we did, having a decent lead at half-time and it can be hard to stay mentally focused but we finished sets in the areas we wanted. \"We were quite patient and that was the most pleasing thing.\" Salford head coach Ian Watson: \"We had a little bit of possession on their try line at the start and we probably needed to just take a couple of points there to try and turn the tide. \"It would have given us a foothold in the game, but we didn't and they marched us the full length. \"I thought their middles were outstanding, they absolutely dominated us to be fair.

        "article": "Lewis Hamilton equalled Michael Schumacher's all-time record of 68 Formula 1 pole positions at the Belgian Grand Prix. The Mercedes driver did a sensational lap to beat title rival Sebastian Vettel of Ferrari, who was on top form himself, by 0.242 seconds. Hamilton was 0.541secs ahead of team-mate Valtteri Bottas, who was third ahead of Kimi Raikkonen's Ferrari. Max Verstappen headed team-mate Daniel Ricciardo to an all-Red Bull third row. The key to Hamilton's pole was arguably a stupendous effort through the middle sector of the lap at the demanding Spa-Francorchamps track in the Ardennes mountains. The Ferrari had been quicker than the Mercedes through sector two throughout the weekend but Hamilton pulled something out of the bag on his final run to set the pace there by 0.2secs. Afterwards, F1 sporting boss Ross Brawn delivered a message from Schumacher's family. Brawn said: \"His wife Corinna said that Michael always believed records were there to be broken, and they want to offer their congratulations.\" Schumacher has not been seen in public since the skiing accident in 2013 that left him with severe head injuries and in a coma for some months. His family have consistently said his recovery will be long and hard and have given no other news of his condition. \"It's a special day,\" said Hamilton. \"I knew it was on the horizon and knew I'd get the 68th pole, but I haven't thought about it much. \"But now being there it is an unusual place to be. I remember coming here in 1996, my first grand prix, and watching Michael come by and the engine vibrated my rib cage and that was when my love for the sport took another step. \"And I have now equalled him on poles and it is very surreal. It is a humbling experience knowing Michael is such a legend. It is an incredible feat he achieved and I am very proud to be up there with him. \"To be able to put a lap together like that is a dream. I have the best job in the world. It's a pleasure to be here. \"To hear the message Ross just gave, I have to say a big thank you. I followed Michael and raced against him and always admired him. My prayers are for him and the family and he will always be one of the greatest of all time.\" As good as Hamilton's lap was, Vettel's was equally impressive. The German had been struggling for pace for much of the weekend compared to team-mate Kimi Raikkonen and was half a second down on Hamilton after the first runs in the top-10 shootout. When Hamilton reduced his own time by a further 0.354secs on his final run and Bottas popped up in second place ahead of Raikkonen, Vettel appeared to have problems. But he produced his own mega-lap to join Hamilton on the front row. \"It was the right lap at the right time,\" Vettel said, adding that he had been helped by a slipstream from Raikkonen in the final sector, where the German set the fastest time of all in a part of the track where Mercedes have dominated all weekend. The stage is therefore set for a titanic battle between the two title rivals in the race, which Vettel starts 14 points ahead of Hamilton. Behind the Red Bulls, Renault's Nico Hulkenberg was seventh, a place that appeared set to occupied by his team-mate Jolyon Palmer. The Englishman, who has had a difficult start to the season, had the edge on Hulkenberg all day and was seventh in the second part of qualifying. But he suffered a loss of gearbox oil pressure on his out-lap at the start of Q3 and pulled off track in a cloud of smoke. Palmer will thus start 10th, as the final Q3 runner, behind the Force Indias of Sergio Perez and Esteban Ocon. McLaren's Fernando Alonso was 11th, bemoaning a loss of power on his final lap in Q2. McLaren had used team-mate Stoffel Vandoorne, who has a 60-place grid penalty for engine and gearbox transgressions, to 'tow' Alonso to try to compensate for the Honda engines lack of power on both his runs. Alonso was 10th after his first run but on his final lap, which looked set to be quicker, the engine lost hybrid energy deployment between Pouhon and Stavelot and he had to abort the lap. \"No power, no power,\" he screamed over the radio. But after getting over the frustration he said it was a generally positive weekend because 11th with choice of tyres might be better for the race and that the car had been surprisingly competitive on such a power track.

        "article": "Iraqis go to the polls on 30 April in parliamentary elections overshadowed by violence and sectarian tension. Prime Minister Nouri Maliki is bidding for a third term, presenting himself as the only candidate capable of defeating a growing al-Qaeda-inspired insurgency. But Sunni Arabs and Kurds accuse Mr Maliki of being too authoritarian and pro-Shia. Some observers think his re-election could endanger Iraq's fragile democracy. These elections are likely to have a big influence on the future stability - and possible even unity - of Iraq. Following five years of sectarian violence in the wake of the 2003 US invasion, the three main ethnic-religious groups - the Shia Arab majority, Sunni Arabs and Kurds - achieved some degree of co-operation and power-sharing, but there are fears this may be breaking down. A worsening of violence in Iraq - or even the break-up of the country - could have major implications for a region already strained by power rivalries, tensions between Shia and Sunni communities and the Syrian civil war. Iraq: Prospects of partition as violence takes its toll Iraqi politics is dominated by shifting alliances or blocs, usually rooted in one of the ethnic and religious communities. Prime Minister Maliki's mainly Shia State of Law bloc only came second at the last election in 2010, which saw the Shia vote split between two rival blocs. It took nine months of difficult negotiations before a government was formed, and Mr Maliki held on for a second term at the head of a Shia-dominated coalition. Since the last election, Mr Maliki has increasingly centralised power in his hands, gaining control over the security forces and - according to some - strong influence over the theoretically independent courts. He says this is needed to deal with Iraq's problems, but many Sunnis argue he has a sectarian agenda and favours the majority Shia. Several key Sunni figures have been arrested and some of them tried in what they claimed was political persecution. Mr Maliki's tough manner of dealing with anti-government protests in majority Sunni areas has further alienated Sunni opinion. Even some Shia groups have become critical. Maliki: Iraq's shrewd operator Against the backdrop of growing political tensions between the majority Shia and minority Sunnis, sectarian violence saw a resurgence last year. The UN reported that at least 7,818 civilians and 1,050 security forces members were killed in Iraq in 2013 - the highest death toll for five years. It seems to be linked to decreased stability in Syria, the Iraqi government's crackdown on Sunni protest camps, and the perception that the Shia-led government is not treating Sunnis fairly, which has strengthened al-Qaeda's position in Iraq. Moderate Sunni tribal militias that fought the radicals and had a role in ending the civil war have become suspicious of the Shia-dominated Baghdad authorities. Buoyed by the conflict in neighbouring Syria, al-Qaeda-inspired Sunni Islamist militants have seized some areas in Sunni-dominated Anbar province. They have also been increasingly carrying out suicide attacks in mainly Shia areas ahead of the election. UN: Iraq's death toll highest in five years Iraq Anbar violence sparks civilian search for safety Voters are frustrated with rampant corruption and poor public services, but see that solving them depends on improved security. Growing violence has shaken Iraqis' confidence in the government's ability to protect people, especially among the Shia majority. Mr Maliki has responded by promoting his determination to deal with the insurgency, using force if necessary. But critics say this is fraught with the danger of further alienating Sunnis. What Iraqis have to say about the elections This is tricky to predict. Iraq operates a form of proportional representation, which gives smaller parties slightly better chances to win seats, making it hard to win an overall majority. Who ends up running Iraq could mainly depend on the post-election coalition talks. Mr Maliki is seen has having a good chance of winning again, if only because his State of Law alliance has escaped the fragmentation seen by other blocs that competed in the last election. His main rival then, former Prime Minister Iyad Allawi, is seen as less of a contender this time round, but could still do well among Sunnis. His secular Iraqiya bloc, which included both Shia and Sunni and came first in 2010, has fractured, and Mr Allawi (a Shia) is now seen as a more overtly pro-Sunni figure. The main threat to Mr Maliki is seen as coming from other Shia blocs. One is led by the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq (ISCI), and has a strong focus on welfare and public services. The other is the Ahrar bloc, although this has been weakened somewhat by the surprise resignation of its leading figure, the Shia cleric Moqtada Sadr, whose Mehdi Army fought US troops during the occupation.

        "article": "The president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) Thomas Bach says he has \"no regrets\" about letting Russia compete at the Rio Games this summer, despite a state-sponsored cheating programme. Media playback is not supported on this device In an exclusive interview with the BBC, Bach stands by his handling of the crisis, but admits there are \"deficiencies\" in the current anti-doping system. Speaking at a meeting of the Association of National Olympic Committees in Doha, the German pledged to increase funding in the fight for clean sport, if the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) was reformed. Meanwhile, Bach said he was considering a request to appear at a hearing next month of a US Congressional committee investigating anti-doping. The 62-year-old also insisted that the Rio Games had been a \"great success\" despite a troubled build-up and concerns over the cost of staging the event. \"Achieving this under extremely difficult circumstances to make it the most watched Games in history is a great demonstration of the relevance and success of the Olympics,\" he said. The IOC has been heavily criticised for resisting calls from Wada to impose a blanket ban on the Russian team in the wake of a damning report by Professor Richard McLaren into systemic, state-assisted cheating and the manipulation of samples. In August, Bach rejected this as a \"nuclear option\" and instead gave responsibility to international federations to make decisions about their specific sport. The IAAF, athletics' world governing body, had already banned the country's track and field athletes, but hundreds of Russians competed in Rio, with the team coming fourth in the medal table. When asked if he had any regrets, Bach said: \"In general, no. Take the Russian decision; we have such broad support within the Olympic movement, the national Olympic committees, the international federations, the major athlete representatives, and in the political world, where this decision was highly appreciated. \"I was always sure, because with this decision we were defending our values and I always was sure we should not take a political decision. We should take a decision for sport, a decision which is doing justice to the athletes. \"If you are convinced of your values then you can also weather a storm because you know in the long run - once the dust has settled and the storm is over - then the people will realise that the values have been respected. This is why in this point I don't have any regrets.\" McLaren's second report into Russian doping at the Sochi 2014 Winter Games is expected early next month with speculation it could lead to pressure for further sanctions against the country for the 2018 Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea. When asked how long it could take before Russia could be trusted again, Bach said: \"That depends on the report because I don't know what's going to happen. \"We have to wait and then anticipate this final report of the IOC as we've created two commissions who will also give the Russian side a chance to be heard. This is a fair procedure and then the IOC will take all of the necessary measures and sanctions.\" Wada holds a board meeting in Glasgow this weekend where there will be an attempt to agree a new roadmap for reforms to the global anti-doping system. Some in the anti-doping community want the agency to be strengthened and empowered with greater independence and sanctioning power. However, Bach said: \"I strongly believe that the prosecutor should never be the judge and this is why the IOC made sanctioning independent - we delegated it to the Court of Arbitration for Sport to have a clear separation of power. This separation of power should also be applied in the fight against doping.\" The IOC, which contributes around half of Wada's $30m (\u00a324m) annual budget, matching funding from governments, has come under pressure to give more money to the fight for clean sport. On his vision for the future of anti-doping, Bach said he wanted \"a Wada anti-doping system which is independent from the sports organisations as well as from national interests, where an independent entity determines with the international federations an anti-doping programme, not only for each sport but also each discipline, to ensure a level playing field and to make this transparent for all athletes\". Asked if the system is broken, he said: \"It has its deficiencies. \"These have to be corrected and this is why we're making these far-reaching proposals - and if it needs more investment we are ready, the Olympic movement is ready. \"This is why we have said we want reforms to be approved and implemented and then we are ready with governments to provide the necessary financing - you cannot just give money and wait to see what someone will do or not do. I'm confident the athletes will regain their trust in Wada and the anti-doping system.\" Meanwhile, the BBC has learned that Bach has been asked to appear next month in front of an investigations hearing of the US House of Representatives' Committee on Energy and Commerce - whose jurisdiction includes funding for US anti-doping and oversight of sports. \"We are carefully considering all of the invitations we get from all over the world,\" said Bach. A Wada independent observers report recently highlighted \"serious failings\" with the IOC's anti-doping programme at the Rio Games. It found that many athletes who had been targeted for testing could not be found and on some days, 50% of tests were aborted. More than 4,000 athletes had no record of any testing in 2016. Despite this, Bach said: \"Overall there was progress in the fight against doping and overall the integrity of the tests was not affected, so we are not happy with the challenges, but on the other hand we did deliver a reliable programme.\" Russia is continuing to host winter sports events, despite the IOC urging sports to look for alternative venues following the doping scandal and to freeze any preparations for major championships in the country. In September however, Russia was awarded the 2021 Biathlon World Championships. \"This is something the IOC cannot impose,\" said Bach. \"The international federations are autonomous from the IOC, we can only give guidelines.\"",

        "article": "Mark McGhee has been appointed manager of Scottish Premiership club Motherwell for a second time, with the Scotland assistant boss signing until May 2017. And the 58-year-old says Gordon Strachan has asked him to carry on in his national role should the Scotland boss decide to remain in charge. \"I was really keen to get back into club management, but the destination was important,\" said McGhee. \"It was important I returned at a club close to my heart and was a challenge.\" Motherwell, who sit ninth in the Scottish Premiership, sacked Ian Baraclough last month. McGhee was in charge at Fir Park for two years before leaving to join Aberdeen in 2009. The former Scotland striker, who also managed Reading, Leicester City, Wolves, Millwall, Brighton and Aberdeen, had his last managerial stint at Bristol Rovers in 2012 but lasted less than a year. McGhee, who has been Strachan's assistant since January 2013, said \"I've had several things put to me over the last few years\" in his desire to return to club football. \"I am delighted to be back at Fir Park and Motherwell, a club in which I have a real affection for after some fantastic highs and tragic lows in my last spell,\" he said. McGhee steered Motherwell to a third-place finish and European qualification for the first time in 13 years in his debut season. During his time at Fir Park, he was short-listed for the Scotland manager's post, losing out to George Burley. Asked about inheriting someone else's squad, McGhee said: \"I have done it before and have no worries about that. \"I am not getting ahead of myself here, but I went to Brighton after a few games and we got promoted through the play-offs and I went to Millwall after a few games and won the title.\" As for his targets, he said: \"I think not being in the embarrassing situation they were in last season and scrambling at the end to avoid relegation. \"After that, the expectations have not been defined.\" Youth team coach Stephen Craigan had been appointed on an interim basis while a successor to Baraclough was sought. Majority shareholder Les Hutchison added: \"The football committee have undertaken a very rigorous selection process and considered over 80 applicants and interviewed a very strong shortlist of candidates before making their recommendation to the chairman and myself. \"I was delighted to talk in detail with Mark about the future plans for the club and he demonstrated a real enthusiasm for the task ahead. \"I was pleased he was the unanimous choice of the board.\"",

        "article": "Men's professional tennis has enjoyed another high-powered year, with record attendances at the Association of Tennis Professionals' (ATP) World Finals in London last month, as well as a number of major new sponsor deals signed. Meanwhile, the big four of Djokovic, Federer, Nadal and Murray show no signs yet of retiring, while others such as Wawrinka, Berdych, and Nishikori also provide competition and excitement for fans and backers of the sport. So it may come as something of a surprise to learn that ATP chief executive Chris Kermode, the man behind the continued upwards trajectory, is about to launch a major review looking ahead to what direction men's tennis should take from 2018 onwards. \"We will start the process in 2016, taking a hard look at the long term, and what the ATP stands for,\" he tells me. \"Can we offer a better service to players and tournaments? Can we do better in our marketing and promotion, and use social media and digital better? \"We will look at how we connect with our audiences, at our TV coverage, our structure of tournaments. Also how many should be in the calendar, and where they should be based? It will be a major work.\" He says there are \"five tennis stakeholders\" to consider - players, tournaments, fans, sponsors and the media. The ATP's review comes after another successful sell-out World Tour Finals at London's O2 Arena, where close to 263,000 fans watched the top eight players compete.  It brought the overall attendance on the 2015 ATP World Tour season to an all-time record of 4.5 million fans (excluding Grand Slams). Mr Kermode says some 15% to 20% of the ATP's annual revenue's annual revenues come from the end of year finals, so as an event it is \"financially very important\". Now, the finals will stay in London until 2018, beyond the original 2016 deadline. And Mr Kermode says that while other cities offered more money, they did not provide the profile - or \"statement for tennis\" - he says they currently enjoy at the O2. The 50-year-old also says he has made a conscious effort to present the ATP finals in a different way to other London tournaments, Wimbledon and the Aegon at Queen's (where he used to be tournament director). \"We have made it an entertainment event as much as a sports event,\" says Mr Kermode. World Tour Finals sponsor Barclays will pull out after the end of 2016, as it cuts back its sport sponsorship, but Mr Kermode says the ATP is confident of finding another big backer. \"The issue for us at present is whether we go for a two year sponsor deal around London, or a longer deal that is linked to London and another venue somewhere else,\" says the keen Neil Young music fan. \"We are talking to five companies as potential sponsors, and want to be quick in securing a deal.\" The ATP has been boosted by the fact that in the past six months it has secured deals worth $160m (\u00c2\u00a3106m) over the next five years. These include a deal with Emirates, reportedly worth $50m, to replace beer brand Corona as an ATP World Tour sponsor.  The airline's logo will replace those of the Mexican beverage on nets at events. New deals have also been signed with Peugeot, Maui Jim Sunglasses, Indian IT services group Infosys, and Chinese online video business Letv. Infosys has been given the task of crunching numbers and stats for tennis fans, and sports media, in the same way that IBM does at Wimbledon and SAP does for the WTA women's tour. \"In the US sports stats are of huge interest, historically less so in Europe,\" says Mr Kermode. \"But many new-generation fans are interested in player statistics, and it is an area we want to focus on. \"The more knowledge we acquire about our sport, the more fans want it.\" With the sponsorship tank nearly full, he says that there is still room to sign other player-focussed deals with firms providing things like medical services and applications, and fitness products. Mr Kermode, who is approaching the last 12 months of his current three year term, says he is keen to stay on for another period in office, but that the final decision lies with the ATP board, not him. One projected development he still wants to get off the ground is an end-of-year finals event for the top eight under-21 players in the world.  Originally envisaged for the 2016 calendar, he now says that deadline may be looking tight. \"A final decision has still to be made,\" he says, but - whenever launched - it is envisaged the event will slot in between the Paris Masters in late October and ATP finals in London in mid-November. As well as giving young players experience of high-level, pressurised, competition in the global spotlight, and thus increasing their ability to compete at the top ends of ATP events and Grand Slams, he also plans to use the event to innovate. One of these proposed changes might be to the player warm-up, he says. \"We currently bring the players dramatically on court at the O2, as though they are coming out for a boxing match, which everyone finds very exciting, \" he says. \"But then you get the player warm up, and things cool off for about 10 minutes. It does not matter if you are in the stadium, there is still that buzz, but it can be bit of a dampener for TV viewers.\" Meanwhile, he remains sanguine about the day when the \"Big Four\" male players start retiring. \"Genuinely, I am not worried about it all,\" says Mr Kermode. \"It is like when you had the Borg and McEnroe era, then they retired and you had players like Becker, Agassi, and Edberg, coming through.\" He points to players such as Nishikori (\"huge in Asia\") , Roanic (\"that North American presence\"),  and Dimitrov (\"still to fulfil his potential\"),  as well as youngsters such as Kyrgios and Coric. \"There is a great contrast in styles, and good geographical spread,\" he says.  \"Sport is a very simple business model, basically it is about caring about someone winning against someone else, and that will continue.\"",

It doesn't sit that comfortably with me,\" Keown said on Match of the Day. \"If you're assistant manager to Ranieri and he's walked, why is it you suddenly want to be the manager?\" Shakespeare, 53, has never managed full-time and was brought to Leicester by Ranieri's predecessor Nigel Pearson. He says he expects to speak with the Leicester hierarchy about his future next week. \"You have personal ambition, but I think it's almost out of order that he wants to jump in for that job,\" said Keown. \"Surely they'll go for a manager who is bigger with more experience.\" Former Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy added: \"While Craig Shakespeare is winning, leave him in charge. Why change? Let him carry on.\" Speaking after his side moved five points clear of the relegation zone, Shakespeare said: \"My remit was to win these two games and that's what we've done,\" he said. \"The owners will make a decision for the good of the club and until I talk to them I don't know what that will be. But as I have said previously, I'm comfortable with that. \"I can't control it and there's no point worrying about it.\" Leicester had not scored a league goal in 2017 until Shakespeare took charge, but have now scored six in two games - twice as many Premier League goals as they did in their last 10 matches under Ranieri. Shakespeare has never managed a club before but has a long association with the Foxes. The Englishman was assistant manager to Nigel Pearson for two years from 2008, following Pearson to Hull in 2010 before they both returned to Leicester a year later. Following Pearson's sacking in 2015, Shakespeare remained at the club as Ranieri's assistant. Leicester are believed to have spoken to a number of potential candidates to replace Ranieri, but could also consider giving Shakespeare the job until the end of the season. The Foxes have held informal discussions with former England boss Roy Hodgson.

But there has been controversy over \"consensual searches\", where people are searched without any legal basis. If approved by parliament, the code will end consensual searches from May. Ministers asked an advisory group of experts to draft the code following a BBC Scotland investigation which revealed that hundreds of children under the age of 12 were being subjected to consensual stop searches. The new code states that stopping and searching members of the public is a \"significant intrusion into their personal liberty and privacy\". It must therefore be done for a good reason, and be both \"necessary and proportionate\", it says. This means that the officer must have a \"reasonable suspicion\" based on \"facts, information and/or intelligence\" that the person being searched is likely to be carrying an illegal item. But officers will not be allowed to search someone based purely on their appearance - for example age, race or gender - or because they have previous convictions. The codes states: \"A stop and search will not be carried out in a manner which is abusive, discriminatory, or which amounts to harassment or intimidation.\" The person being searched must understand why it is being carried out, with the officer also required to carry it out \"with respect for individual needs - including religious and cultural values and beliefs.\" And officers must be \"fully accountable\" for the searches they carry out, with all stop and searches accurately recorded, and open to scrutiny. The code also sets out specific guidelines for dealing with children and vulnerable adults, and acknowledges that that they may require additional support to help them comprehend and participate in the search process. It says: \"In taking a decision to search a child or a young person, a constable must treat the need to safeguard and promote the well-being of that child or young person as a primary consideration. \"Where a constable believes it to be more harmful to a child or young person to carry out a search than not, then the search should not proceed and other measures to safeguard them should be considered.\" It also says that officers should use \"age-appropriate terms\" when speaking with children and young people and avoid the use of technical or legal language, unless required to do so by law. The Scottish government announced on 4 November 2016 that there is not enough evidence to support creating a police power to search children for alcohol at this time. The situation will be re-assessed after the code has been in force for 12 months A code of practice underpinning the use of stop and search is required under The Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2016. Justice Secretary Michael Matheson said stop and search was a valuable tool for combating crime, but that it was important to strike a balance between protecting the public and recognising people's human rights. He said: \"This new code is about finding that balance and maintaining the trust between the police and the public. \"With this new code we will ensure stop and search is carried out with the fairness, integrity, respect and accountability that we expect from our police officers in all of their duties.\" Research published by Edinburgh University in 2014 showed police in Scotland were far more likely to carry out stop and searches than their colleagues in England and Wales. The figures also suggested that young people were the most likely to be searched. But the number of stop-and-searches has fallen dramatically since then, with 888 consensual searches and 20,665 statutory searches conducted between 1 April and 30 September last year. This compared with 450,173 consensual searches and 192,470 statutory searches in 2013/14. Assistant Chief Constable Mark Williams said Police Scotland had made \"real progress\" on the issue, and \"very much welcomed\" the new guidelines. He added: \"We are currently training all our officers in advance of its introduction to ensure we are fully prepared.\"",

        "article": "European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has announced plans that he says will offer a \"swift, determined and comprehensive\" response to Europe's migrant crisis. Under the proposals, 120,000 additional asylum seekers will be distributed among EU nations, with binding quotas. It comes after a surge of thousands of mainly Syrian migrants pushed north through Europe in recent days. Mr Juncker told the European Parliament it was \"not a time to take fright\". Germany, the main destination for many migrants, supports quotas, but some EU countries oppose a compulsory system. Mr Juncker's plans were set out in a \"state of the union\" annual address in which he outlined the priorities of the European Commission. He opened his speech by admitting the European Union was \"not in a good situation. There is a lack of Europe in this union, and a lack of union in this union\". He said tackling the crisis was \"a matter of humanity and human dignity. It is true that Europe cannot house all the misery in the world. But we have to put it into perspective. \"This still represents just 0.11% of the EU population. In Lebanon refugees represent 25% of the population.\" The mass migration has seen those seeking an end to persecution, conflict and hardship travel from Turkey across the sea to Greece, through Macedonia and Serbia, and then to Hungary from where they aim to reach Austria, Germany and Sweden. On Wednesday, Denmark suspended all rail links with Germany and shut a section of motorway after migrants crossed the border and began walking north, apparently trying to reach Sweden. In southern Hungary, migrants on the border with Serbia broke through police lines at the Roszke camp, forcing the closure of the M5 highway. Among Mr Juncker's proposals: \"It's 160,000 refugees in total that Europeans have to take into their arms and I really hope that this time everyone will be on board - no rhetoric, action is what is needed,\" he told MEPs. The new plans would relocate 60% of those now in Italy, Greece and Hungary to Germany, France and Spain. The numbers allocated to each country would depend on GDP, population, unemployment rate and asylum applications already processed. Countries refusing to take in migrants could face financial penalties. 14 Sept: Special meeting of EU interior ministers on refugee crisis, with Juncker proposals on agenda 15-16 Oct: EU leaders' summit, with refugee crisis high on agenda.

Spain on Wednesday said it would accept a quota of almost 15,000 extra migrants migrants set by EU. However Mr Juncker's proposals was criticised by both the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka said compulsory quotas were \"not a good solution\", while his Slovak counterpart called them \"irrational\". Poland and Romania have also opposed the idea, although Poland has agreed to take in more migrants. France welcomed the first of 1,000 migrants it has pledged to take from Germany, having committed to receive 24,000 migrants over two years. In a separate development Australia has announced plans to take in 12,000 Syrian refugees. Germany has welcomed Syrian migrants, waiving EU rules and saying it expects to deal with 800,000 asylum seekers this year alone - though not all will qualify as refugees and some will be sent back. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Wednesday that Germany needed to learn from its mistakes in labelling incomers in the post-war period as \"Gastarbeiter\" or \"guest workers\" - with the implication that they were not permanent residents. Many of the refugees it expects in future \"will become new citizens of our country\", she said. A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.",

Matthew Daley, 35, denies murder but has admitted attacking 79-year-old retired solicitor Donald Lock claiming diminished responsibility. Lynda Daley agreed at Lewes Crown Court the day Mr Lock was killed was \"the day that all your nightmares came true\". Mr Lock was attacked on the A24 at Findon, near Worthing last July. Earlier defence counsel David Howker QC said Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust apologised to Mr Daley's family for having \"failed\" him in his care and treatment. Mrs Daley told the court her son had many debts and the recent breakdown of his relationship with his girlfriend had left him \"distraught\". \"We were never provided with a proper diagnosis. We were frequently in meetings but we were not listened to,\" she said. \"It's been continual over the last 10 years. In the past 10 years we have pleaded to people, it has been on a regular basis.\" Mrs Daley told the court the apology from the NHS trust was \"10 years too late\". She said she feared her son was involved in the killing in Findon when she saw the news on television. When she failed to contact him she drove to the stables where he worked and saw his damaged car. The court heard the family decided to go to Worthing police station and as Mrs Daley was about enter, her son called her saying: \"I need to know where you are and that I can trust you.\" Mr Daley also told her he had done \"something really bad or something really wrong. \"I killed someone.\" The court also heard Mr Daley police told a police officer \"when I drive, people try and break into my thoughts\". He also said: \"It's sad that I had to kill someone who was so aggressive to me when I wasn't aggressive at all.\" Mr Lock was returning from a cycling meet when he was stabbed 39 times during a \"ferocious\" attack on the A24 at Findon in July. Witnesses have described Mr Daley as being \"expressionless\" during the attack, as though he was \"having a passport photo\" taken. Mr Lock was fatally stabbed after he hit the back of Mr Daley's Ford Fusion and then asked why he had braked so abruptly. Jurors have been told that Mr Daley's defence team will claim the defendant may have been acting in self defence because Mr Lock was angry and aggressive .

Media playback is not supported on this device \"Cannonball\" Ken is also known as the \"Sheriff\" among his Scarlets team-mates, and has no objection to either. But \"super sub\" was one the Wales hooker, who wins his 50th-cap against France in the Six Nations on Saturday, did not relish. Owens, 30, has made 31 of his previous 49 Wales appearances from the bench. During Wales' 2015 World Cup campaign, coach Warren Gatland repeatedly praised Owens' contribution in the latter part of matches while acknowledging the player was frustrated by his long run among the replacements. That, however, has changed this season with Owens having started all of Wales' Six Nations matches and earned praise from pundits for the quality of his performances. \"You do get frustrated, but you can't let it drag you down,\" Owens says. \"You have got to keep plugging away, just keep trying to improve yourself. \"At the end of the day, it's much better to be involved in the 23 than not being involved at all, whether that be with your region or with Wales. \"I will always push myself to want to start, and thankfully I have had my opportunity now. I have got to keep playing well because there are plenty of hookers in Wales playing well.\" Media playback is not supported on this device Some experts, including former England number two Brian Moore, have been so impressed they have pencilled-in Owens as a British and Irish Lions tourist for this summer's trip to New Zealand. Like the rest of the players, Owens sidesteps the Lions question but concedes he is more than happy with his form. \"I am pretty happy. The set-piece has gone well, and it is just nice to have a consistent run of games starting. I think that has helped me,\" he added. \"I work hard and try to take my chances when they come, and thankfully, I am playing okay at the moment. \"I am not doing a lot different to what I was doing before. Perhaps I am a lot more consistent at the moment.\" Another factor in Owens' happiness is that he has had to come back from serious neck injuries which have seen him undergo two operations and miss a good deal of rugby. He says his latest lay-off, which sidelined him for four months in 2014, was particularly frustrating. \"Initially, I thought I would be out for six to eight weeks,\" he said. \"The neck wasn't really the problem, it was nerve damage because it was my second big impact on that part of the nerves. \"It just took forever for it to regenerate, and it is only really now that my strength is anywhere near where it should be. \"It was my third neck injury but thankfully, touch wood, there were no issues and I managed to get through it. \"I always thought I would get back, it was just a case of how long it would take for the nerves to regenerate.\" Owens has shown nerves of steel at the line-outs this season, with Wales' set-piece operating as an effective attacking tool - particularly in the 22-9 win over Ireland. That match also saw Owens become a social media sensation thanks to his full-blooded celebration caught on camera when Jamie Roberts scored the match-clinching try. \"Maybe I went a bit over the top,\" he says. \"That score was huge. The game was won, and we knew how important the victory was to us as a squad.\" Owens already has reason to celebrate in Paris as he reached a significant milestone. A sixth successive win against France and would give him reason to reprise his bellowing, fist-pumping celebration. That would be a significant notch on the Sheriff's badge.",

Twenty hostages, most of them foreign, were killed when Islamist militants stormed a cafe in the capital, Dhaka. Two police officers also died and 30 were injured. After a 12-hour siege, commandos rescued 13 people. The so-called Islamic State (IS) group said it was behind the attack but the government has denied this. Bangladesh's home minister said on Sunday that the attackers belonged to a local militant group which has been banned for more than a decade. \"They are members of the Jamaeytul Mujahdeen Bangladesh (JMB),\" Asaduzzaman Khan said. \"They have no connections with the Islamic State.\" Mr Khan said the men made no demands during the attack. He said three of the gunmen were under 22 and had been missing for six months. Police chief Shahidul Hoque made some of the men's first names public: Akash, Bikash, Don, Bandhon and Ripon. Bangladesh at crossroads as violence hits Is extremism on the rise in Bangladesh? Six attackers were killed in the raid on the Holey Artisan cafe in the Gulshan neighbourhood. A seventh man was arrested and is still being questioned. It is not yet clear what involvement he had in the attack. IS had earlier released photographs of the alleged attackers posing in front of a black IS flag. The men were said to belong to well-to-do local families. They studied in private schools and universities, not in Islamic seminaries or madrassas, where many Islamist militant groups are thought to draw recruits. Social media has been buzzing with former classmates who have recognised some of the attackers from their pictures, says the BBC's Sanjoy Majumder in Dhaka. Bangladesh has declared two days of national mourning. Nine Italians, seven Japanese, one US citizen and an Indian were among the dead. One Italian is unaccounted for. The JMB group has been blamed for a wave of small-scale terrorism attacks in Bangladesh over the past year, including the killings of secular bloggers, atheists and an LGBT rights campaigner. Its top two leaders were arrested and executed in 2008, after near-simultaneous bomb attacks in all the country's 64 districts.

        "article": "On Black Friday retailers will be aiming for a \"frenzied\" atmosphere - the hope being it makes you buy more. Newsbeat has been finding out how the shops will be trying to drive sales. Black Friday's originally a American idea linked to the Thanksgiving holiday but retailers in the UK say the annual sales day is taking off here too. Spending will be up 22% on last year, according to Visa, which predicts that \u00c2\u00a3360,000 will be spent every minute. We've been speaking to retail consultants about some of the methods shops use to try to make that happen. \"An atmosphere of frenzy and anticipation\" is the aim, James Logie, from Retail Management Consultants tells Newsbeat. Many deals will be for 24 hours only, to create a sense of urgency. Tesco's 24-hour stores began the sale at one minute past midnight and John Lewis will be revealing many of its deals then too. \"All of this appeals to our hunter instincts to go out there and get the best bargains,\" says Clare Rayner, a retail consultant. But Guy Anker from moneysavingexpert.com warns: \"It's classic sales pressure. Consumers and shoppers need to be on their guard. \"Just because it's on sale in one place doesn't mean that's the cheapest place to buy it. \"If you look at some of the big brands that have their own stores - even in a sale it's sometimes cheaper to buy those items at a department store or a more general store that sells any number of brands.\" James says \"commitment consistency\" is a key tactic. This is the idea that once you've committed to buy something, you'll buy again. We've long seen merchandise being placed by the till and there are plenty of bargains positioned there today. Staff will be encouraging consumers to buy a matching garment, or a warranty to go with what they've already decided to buy, says Clare. Guy adds: \"What's really important is to think about what you really want and need in advance.\" \"High energy music can create frenzied atmosphere, stimulate the senses and create that sense of having to rush,\" says James. Guy says that while the \"smell of mulled wine, Christmas music, and flowers might be nice - it's all part of the sales trick to try to get you to spend. \"So try to make rational decision and not an emotional one.\" Many stores will bring in extra staff - and this could be the day the Christmas hats come out. \"Staff will be on parade tomorrow, we'll see a lot more engagement than usual.\" Clare says staff \"really have to make this one day count\".

        "article": "A feature-length documentary film about the founder of Europe's first Tibetan Buddhist centre in Dumfriesshire has staged its world premiere. The story of Akong Tulku Rinpoche was screened at the Samye Ling site he founded in Eskdalemuir. A Remarkable Life covers everything from his birth in Tibet in 1939 to his murder in China in 2013. Shortly before his death, he authorised the film to be made which was given its premiere in southern Scotland. Akong Rinpoche was installed as abbot of a monastery in eastern Tibet at the age of just four having been identified as the reincarnation of the previous abbot. When he was 19, with China having occupied Tibet and tensions between the countries at their height, he joined a freedom walk over the Himalayas to India. It took 10 months and of the 200 people who started, only 15 survived. Akong eventually made his way to the UK in 1959 and acquired an old farmhouse at Eskdalemuir where Samye Ling was founded in 1967. The film's executive producer Vin Harris told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"I think they travelled around lots of places, there was a story that it kind of reminded them of Tibet. \"There was someone there who was running a spiritual centre and he was ready to move on so they basically took it over. \"They were very much welcomed, particularly in Dumfries, Rinpoche made his family life there and had very good friends here.\" Samye Ling was the first Buddhist monastery to be founded in Europe and students later included David Bowie and Leonard Cohen. It has now grown into a large complex for the study and teaching of Buddhism, with a vast temple at its heart. From there, Akong spearheaded a range of projects including  ROKPA International, which carries out humanitarian work in Tibet, Nepal, India and Africa. It was while in China in October 2013 that he was murdered, aged 73, but before his death he authorised the film of his life to be made. Its premiere at Samye Ling was attended by the current abbot, Akong's younger brother Lama Yeshe Losal Rinpoche. \"We feel that the film is more a message of hope actually - a celebration of his life,\" Mr Harris said. \"It kind of focuses on the fact that putting compassion into action, rather than being a kind of luxury, is so effective. \"We look at what, as a refugee, he achieved - setting up centres all over the world and helping thousands and thousands of people without compromising that value of compassion.\"",

        "article": "The policing operation to tackle the summer riots across England was flawed, a report from MPs has concluded. The perception that in some areas police had lost control of the streets was the most important reason disorder spread, they said. The Home Affairs Committee said insufficient numbers of officers were initially deployed and police training for public disorder was inadequate. The Metropolitan Police said it had outlined what it was doing to improve. The Policing Large Scale Disorder: Lessons from the disturbances of August 2011 report said flooding the streets with police was what ultimately quelled the disorder. \"If numbers could have been increased more rapidly, it is possible that some of the disturbances could have been avoided,\" it said. \"We regret this did not happen and, with the benefit of hindsight, we regard the operation to police the disorder in many towns and cities, and particularly in London as flawed.\" It said the mutual aid system, under which police officers are transferred to forces in need, could have operated more quickly; it may have left areas which had loaned officers to other forces \"vulnerable\". The report said anecdotal evidence from some of those convicted suggested the widespread disorder started when people saw police had \"lost control\" in Tottenham via television and social media. This echoes the findings of the independent Riots Communities and Victims Panel. \"Clearly a feeling existed that desirable consumer goods could be made available by looting. There was a substantial element of opportunistic criminality and copycat behaviour,\" the report said. \"The absence of a police presence or sight of police officers apparently standing by and allowing criminal behaviour to take place was distressing for those whose homes and businesses were being attacked,\" it added. Committee chairman Keith Vaz MP said: \"Individual police officers acted with great bravery, and we commend them for their actions. However, in London and other areas, in contrast with the effectiveness of police responses in some towns and cities, there was a failure of police tactics. \"This situation might have been avoided had police appreciated the magnitude of the task. \"We urgently require a rapid improvement in police training to deal with public disorder. We urge the police to act more quickly in future and to review the arrangements for loaning officers from one force to another in this type of scenario.\" He said that, for those who lost their homes and businesses, \"the state effectively ceased to exist - sometimes for hours at a time\". Mr Vaz told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the committee felt that there should have been better communication between the police and the local business community to ensure that people knew what was happening and how best to protect their livelihoods. \"Those areas where the chief constables had decided to take pre-emptive action and get police officers on the streets quickly were able to contain this violence much more effectively,\" he added. The MPs say had more officers been deployed different tactics could have been used. The Met Police is training more police to use baton rounds and is considering buying three water cannon. Mr Vaz said the committee did not feel water cannon would have helped police in the riots and may have caused \"even greater disorders\". Riots broke out in Tottenham, north London, on 6 August, two days after the fatal shooting by police of 29-year-old Mark Duggan. Unrest spread across London and to other cities, including Manchester, Birmingham and Bristol over the following days. But the committee's report said the specific causes behind the riots were still unknown. The report criticised the Met Police and the Independent Police Complaints Commission over failures in communication with Mr Duggan's family, which it said made a potentially tense situation worse. The committee also concluded it would be unhelpful to switch off social media during times of disorder, following claims rioters used it to organise themselves. \"People who made an active decision to join in the disorder could equally well have heard about it on the television as on social media,\" the report said. The MPs say the government needs to urgently clarify whether the police authorities will be able to recover the \u00c2\u00a389.827m it cost to police the riots. It says the riots were an exceptional series of events at a time the authorities were being asked to make savings. They also call on the government to speed up the process of reimbursing people under the Riot Damages Act. The Met Police said it had already recognised and publicised some of its findings on the issues identified and what it was doing to improve. A spokesman said: \"This includes acknowledging that we didn't have enough officers available quickly enough to respond to the initial disorder or its subsequent unprecedented escalation. As a result we have changed our mobilisation plans.\" He added that the force was reviewing how it engaged with local communities and was working with Acpo and the IPCC to ensure communication was more effective in future investigations. The Association of Chief Police Officers said the report had identified issues it believed was critical to get right within current policing reforms. \"This includes the capacity and ability to move sufficient numbers of police officers around the country when required to protect the public from national threats,\" a spokesman said. \"We will continue to look at all the various reports into the disorder to examine how the police service can best respond in future to the kind of exceptional criminality seen in August.\"",

Researchers are preparing to contact all 6,400 families in the country affected by the condition. Children who have a parent or sibling with type-1 diabetes will be invited for a blood test to see if they are at high risk of developing the disease. Those at risk will be offered a drug called metformin to see if it can hold off diabetes. Metformin is already used to treat diabetes, but it is not clear if it might prevent it from developing in the first place. If successful, the study could challenge long-established thinking on what lies behind type-1 diabetes. Type-1 diabetes develops when the body does not produce insulin. This is the hormone needed to control blood sugar levels. Despite extensive research, there is no way of preventing the disease. Most experts believe it is caused by a problem with the immune system - mistaking insulin-producing cells in the pancreas - called beta cells - as harmful, and attacking them. This study, called the autoimmune diabetes Accelerator Prevention Trial (Adapt), tests an alternative theory developed by Prof Terence Wilkin, from the University of Exeter Medical School. Rather than focusing on halting the immune system, Prof Wilkin says it could be better to work on protecting the beta cells. He argues the key cause of damage is stress on the beta cells as they struggle to cope with demand for insulin. Then, he says, in some people, the immune system kicks in, killing off more cells, accelerating the development of diabetes into childhood - what we know as type-1 diabetes. He hopes metformin will relieve the stress on the beta cells, so they can continue to make insulin. Prof Wilkin said: \"It is possible that a modern environment accelerates the loss of beta cells by overworking and stressing them. \"As a consequence, this could be contributing to the rising incidence of type-1 diabetes, which is appearing in ever younger age groups. \"Adapt will use a medication to protect the beta cells from the stress, so that they survive longer.\" The researchers say if it is successful, the trial will offer a cost-effective way of preventing type-1 diabetes that could be made available immediately to children at risk. The trial has initial funding from the type-1 diabetes charity JDRF. Scotland has the third highest rate of type-1 diabetes in the world, and a good system of record to identify affected families. The study will start recruitment in Tayside and will then extend across Scotland before crossing into England. There are two main types of diabetes: Type-1 diabetes can develop at any age, but usually appears before the age of 40, particularly in childhood. About 10% of all diabetes is type-1, but it is the most common type of childhood diabetes, so it is sometimes called juvenile or early onset diabetes In type-2 diabetes, the body either fails to produce enough insulin to function properly, or the body's cells do not react to insulin. About 90% of adults with diabetes have type-2, and it tends to develop later in life than type-1. Source: NHS Choices",

He was at last year's event, then he came to a pre-election rally here at a time when the polls said he was neck-and-neck with Ed Miliband. How things change in politics. In marked contrast to those nervous days for the Tories, the walkabout today had the feel of a victory parade at times. With all the challenges he's got ahead of him, particularly over Europe, he may not have come to Wales at a better time. Not only was he in a constituency that was one of the Tory gains at the election, but also Labour are in a mess and he came to Wales with news of hundreds of new jobs in the valleys. The most interesting part of my interview was when I asked him whether he was directly appealing to Aston Martin to locate production of its new 4x4 model to south Wales, and he said yes. Claim credit It's not surprising that David Cameron is calling on the car maker to make sure the work is carried out in the UK, and he did hint at that in his answer. But what will raise eyebrows is the apparent promotion of St Athan during a visit to Wales. It could be seen as a dangerous game. Politically you can see where he's coming from. If Aston go with the Vale of Glamorgan, he can claim the credit which, I have no doubt, will deeply annoy the Welsh government which will want to claim the credit for months of hard work behind the scenes. If Aston go elsewhere, then I have no doubt that Welsh government ministers will accuse him of scuppering the deal for a few cheap headlines. Either way, the impression we've got here is that David Cameron is trying to trying to bounce the car firm into making a decision. In my experience, companies hate being told what to do by politicians, never mind on a huge call like this one. NHS spending But if you are going to have a politician trying to bounce one of the world's most famous car makers into a particular decision, then I suppose the argument would be that it might as well be the prime minister. Elsewhere in the interview, Mr Cameron was particularly dismissive of Carwyn Jones' claim this week that some of the Tory spending plans were nigh on impossible to achieve. He responded by saying that this was a typical response from a party who warned that the world was going to end a few years ago. Instead he called on the Welsh government to offer the same protection to NHS spending in Wales as in England. Carwyn Jones has said this is something he wants to do but was unable to offer a cast-iron guarantee. And with all the concern about the electrification of the Great Western mainline, he reaffirmed his political commitment to the work being done all the way to Swansea, although he didn't give any guarantees that it would be completed by the target date of 2018.",

President Barack Obama has declared the state a disaster area, meaning federal aid can be sent to the affected areas. Soldiers and emergency teams have rescued more than 20,000 people from their homes or cars after the floods, which were caused by torrential rain. Emergency workers told the BBC some people were still stuck in their homes. The neighbouring states of Alabama and Mississippi also experienced severe weather, although rains are lessening as they move west over Louisiana and further. One of the worst-affected areas is the Louisiana capital, Baton Rouge. William Daniel, an official there, told the BBC from an emergency control centre that between 8,000 and 10,000 people were in shelters. \"We're still receiving phone calls about people who're trying to get out of their homes because they can't get out because either there's water coming in to their houses or their streets are blocked. \"It is definitely an unprecedented flood here in Baton Rouge. Houses that have never ever even come close to flooding have water three and four foot high in to the houses.\" \"This is a flood of epic proportions,\" JR Shelton, the mayor of Central City told local media. \"When we talk about floods now, we'll talk about the great flood of 2016. \"Everything else pales in comparison.\" Shanita Angrum, 32, called the police when she realised her family were trapped in their home. An officer arrived and carried her six-year-old daughter to safety. \"Snakes were everywhere,\" she told Associated Press. \"The whole time I was just praying for God to make sure me and my family were OK.\" John Mitchell, a 23-year-old Louisiana resident, was forced to swim to safety with his girlfriend and her one-year-old daughter. They were rescued by police officers in a boat. \"This is the worst it's been, ever,'' Mr Mitchell said. \"We tried to wait it out, but we had to get out.\" Several rivers in Louisiana and Mississippi are overflowing. The state is prone to bursts of extreme weather; thousands of acres of Louisiana were flooded in 2011 to divert water from the flooded Mississippi River and to spare cities, including Baton Rouge and New Orleans, that lie downstream.

If, and when, their big day comes, it could be an expensive business covering the cost of hotels, caterers, photographers and florists, not to mention clothes, rings and a honeymoon. Campaigners estimate that the average Australian wedding has a price tag of around 35,000 Australian dollars ($27,000; \u00c2\u00a318,000). \"The world's expert body on the economic impact of marriage equality, the Williams Institute at UCLA, says the most conservative estimate for the [potential] wedding spend of Australian same-sex couples is A$161m,\" says Rodney Croome, the national director of Australian Marriage Equality. \"It could be as high as A$600m. \"On top of this, Australia's failure to achieve marriage equality is a competitive disadvantage when it comes to attracting those skilled migrants and investors for whom non-discriminatory laws are important.\" This week the campaign for reform in Australia received some high-profile support from Alan Joyce, the openly gay, Irish-born chief executive of the airline Qantas. He told the Sydney Morning Herald: \"I've had people coming up to me in the business community and saying that their son, their daughter is finding it tough (being gay), even in this day and age. \"Talking about how important it is for a business leader ... to express our views on things. It is a role model thing.\" The Flying Kangaroo has a long tradition of equality for its staff. Tim Harcourt, an economist at the University of New South Wales Business School, says Australia's national airline has been a beacon of progressive thinking. \"When I worked at Qantas they were always ahead of the game in providing benefits for same-sex partners, whether it be travel or superannuation or so on,\"  he tells the BBC. \"It has worked out pretty well on the basis that having a happy and egalitarian workforce is good for productivity.\" Other corporate heavyweights are joining the campaign for same sex marriage in Australia. Telecom giant Telstra Qantas and PricewaterhouseCoopers have signed an open letter urging the conservative government to consider the economic benefits of reform. They have been joined by the nation's biggest banks, ANZ, the Commonwealth and Westpac, along with retailer David Jones. The letter states:  \"Not only is marriage equality the only truly fair option, but it's also a sound economic option given that a happy workforce is a productive one. \"To remain competitive, and to attract top talent from around the world, organisations - and nations - must create a fair and respectful environment for all.\" Alex Greenwich, an openly gay member of the New South Wales parliament and a former businessman, who ran a recruitment agency before entering politics, believes that employees who are happy and respected at work are more productive. \"There have been so many studies done on the importance of diversity within the workplace and the importance of accepting and treating your staff well in the workplace. \"It's kind of a no-brainer,\" says Mr Greenwich, who believes it is time for Australia to shed its reputation for sexual intolerance. \"We know that gay and lesbian people are out and open in very senior levels in a number of corporates across the world, and a lot of them are now saying why do we want to go to a country where we'll be treated as a second-class citizen?\" The importance of the so-called 'pink dollar' is felt around in the world where reform has been embraced. But this has done little to soften those opposed to change, who argue that any alterations to Australia's marriage laws would be a backward step. \"I think it is disappointing when we have big business trying to influence governments, and for big business to use their clout in this way is intimidating,\" says Wendy Francis, the Queensland director for the Australian Christian Lobby. \"What is good for the economy is stable families and that is what we are really wanting to protect in Australia.\" Bills to allow gay Australians to marry have been rejected by parliamentarians in the past, and there is currently no legislative timetable for further debate in Canberra. The conservative Prime Minister Tony Abbott has deep-seated religious objections, although opinion polls have suggested a majority of voters would be in favour of marriage equality. While there is resistance at a federal level, laws now exist in New South Wales, Tasmania, Queensland, and Victoria, as well as the Australian Capital Territory that legally recognise same-sex unions. Two years ago, New Zealand became the first country in the Asia-Pacific region to legalise same-sex marriages, and the architects of change believe it has had a transformative effect. \"All gay and lesbian people that I encounter are holding their heads just a wee bit higher because they know that the law no longer distinguishes between them and our heterosexual counterparts in this area at least,\" says Kevin Hague, a Green Party MP, who worked on marriage equality campaign. \"I know that popular wedding destinations like Queenstown and Rotorua have had a real boom time with same-sex couples from Australia coming over the get married here.\"",

The station was evacuated shortly before 09:00 BST and trains did not stop at the station for nearly two hours. Pictures on social media showed smoke billowing out from a Bakerloo line train sitting on a platform. Transport for London (TFL) said the fire was caused by an electrical fault. The station reopened and services resumed at around 10:50. London Ambulance Service said it treated four people at Oxford Circus for smoke inhalation, two of whom were taken to hospital as a precaution. BBC journalist Katie Silver was in the station at the time. She said: \"I was coming off the Victoria Line but there was smoke as you walked past the Bakerloo Line and there was the smell of smoke and burning plastic. \"We were all being evacuated. Some people were running up the escalator but they had shut certain exits, although it was very orderly. \"When we got out there were a couple of people crying. I think they were scared.\" TFL said a \"comprehensive investigation\" would take place. Nigel Holness, London Underground's director of network operations, said: \"The cause of the smoke was an electrical fault under one of the carriages, which resulted in a small fire that was quickly extinguished. \"Understandably this was a distressing incident for our customers, for which I give my sincere apologies.\" If you are ever in a Tube station and hear the announcement \"would Inspector Sands please go to the operations room immediately\", you may find that you are asked to leave the station a few minutes later. The message, which can be heard in the above video clip, is an automated message which is activated when the station fire alarm sounds.

It is a safety mechanism that has been agreed with the London Fire Brigade (LFB) and is the same system used in major national rail stations and airports in the UK. LFB is continuing to investigate the cause of the fire. It said it was called to attend at 08:47 and the station had been evacuated before fire crews arrived. Tom Singer, who was at Oxford Circus station at the time, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme he saw a smoke-filled Bakerloo line Tube train coming into the platform. \"As we were waiting on the platform you could smell something coming in, as the train was coming in, and as it got closer the smell got stronger and stronger.\" He added that as the train came in it was clear passengers had been moved from one of the carriages, and then when the train came to a stop people \"came pouring out\". He said: \"There were a lot of people with hands over mouths and coughing a lot coming off of the train. \"It looked like it was just one carriage that had the problem.\" He said he also saw smoke coming from underneath the Tube train.

Leng Ouch gathered evidence to highlight how land concessions (ELCs) were being abused and forcing communities from their homes. His outspoken criticism of the government led to fears for his safety, forcing Mr Ouch into hiding. In 2014, the government cancelled ELCs that covered 89,000 hectares of forest. Despite this, Mr Ouch said he felt the plight of the nation's forests was not improving. \"The situation is getting worse year after year,\" he told BBC News. \"There is no improvement, there is more destruction. There is more deforestation and more demand from overseas. \"We have lost millions of hectares of land through the land concessions.\" It is reported that Cambodia has one of the highest deforestation rates in the world, and just 20-30% of its original forest cover remains. One of the driving forces is the demand from nations like China for high-value hardwoods, such as Siamese rosewood that can fetch US $50,000 (\u00c2\u00a335,000) for a cubic metre. Another cause for the high deforestation rate is the introduction of Economic Land Concessions (ELCs) in 2001, which were designed to support economy-boosting large-scale agriculture, such as rubber and sugar plantations. However, the issuing of the ELCs has affected many communities that depended on the land for their livelihoods. Campaigners say that more than 700,000 people have been driven from their homes as a result of ELCs. Leng Ouch's work has taken him undercover and placed him in extreme danger as he attempted to gather evidence of the impact of the ELCs on forests and forest people. Posing as a labourer, he was able to shed light how the land concessions were being used to provide cover for illegal operations. In 2012, a moratorium was imposed on ELCs, but Mr Ouch argued that it did not go far enough and did not stop forests being felled and people being displaced. Mr Ouch explained why he had spent more than two decades investigating and campaigning to highlight the injustices he felt he had witnessed. \"There are not many people in Cambodia that do this kind of work and I felt it was necessary for me to step in and defend and protect the forests,\" he observed. However, he was aware of the dangers of being an environmental campaigner in Cambodia and had often gone into hiding in order to avoid unwanted attention and threats to his life. Winning a globally prestigious environmental prize does not remove the dangers. In March, Berta Caceres - a 2015 Gold Prize winner - was killed by gunmen in Honduras. She had been a vocal campaigner against a project to build a massive dam across the Gualcarque River. He said he was excited to be one of this year's winners of the Goldman Environmental Prize - described as the Oscars of grassroots environmentalism - as it presented an opportunity to tell the wider world about the situation in Cambodia. \"I hope the world will help us bring about change, and protect forests for future generations,\" he said. \"I will use this award to protect and defend the forests, and to ask local people and the international community to protect these areas.\" He added that he planned to use the prize money to help finance his work. Mr Ouch and five other grassroots campaigners will receive their prize at a ceremony in San Francisco on Monday. The other winners are: Edward Loure from Tanzania: Mr Loure led a grassroots organisation that developed an approach to secure land titles to indigenous communities rather than individuals in order to protect the environment for future generations Zuzana Caputova from Slovakia: Ms Caputova, a lawyer, led a campaign that resulted in the closure of a toxic waste dump that was having an adverse impact on the area's environment and community. Luis Jorge Rivera Herrera from Puerto Rico: Mr Rivera Herrera's campaign led to the establishment a nature reserve at a location deemed to be an important nesting ground for the endangered leatherback turtle. Destiny Watford from the United States: Ms Watford mobilised support in her Baltimore community to halt plans to build what would have been the nation's largest incinerator plant less than a mile from the high school where she was a student. Maxima Acuna from Peru: Ms Acuna, a subsistence farmer, protected her right to continue living off her farmland despite a mining company's plans to develop a gold and copper mine on the site.

        "article": "The home secretary has refused to say whether the Conservative manifesto will repeat their 2015 pledge to cut net migration to the \"tens of thousands\". Amber Rudd told the BBC the manifesto was \"not going to be identical to the last one\" and said things had changed since 2015 because of Brexit. The target, set by David Cameron in 2010, has never been met and recent figures put net migration at 273,000. The PM indicated in April that she would stick with the aim. Speaking on a campaign visit last month, Theresa May, who was Ms Rudd's predecessor as home secretary, told the BBC: \"We want to see sustainable net migration in this country.\" \"I believe that sustainable net migration is in the tens of thousands.\" Questions had been raised about whether the commitment would feature in the Conservative manifesto after Culture Secretary Karen Bradley said that immigration was \"not about putting numbers on it\" but about ensuring Britain had the skilled workers it needed. Asked whether she agreed with her colleague, Ms Rudd told BBC Radio 5live's Pienaar's Politics: \"It's too early to say. I appreciate you want to push me on this but we are going to have to wait until the manifesto comes out.\" Pressed on the issue again, she added: \"That's why we're having a new manifesto. It's not going to be identical to the last one. \"We're setting it out for hopefully for a five year term, we've got a lot to think through to work out what's the best way to deliver on our priorities.\" She added: \"My personal view is, we need to continue to bring immigration down. I want to make sure that we do it in a way that supports businesses, you know we're ending freedom of movement when we leaving the European Union. \"So the situation from that time the [2015] manifesto... has changed because we're leaving the European Union, so it's right that we look at it again.\" Ms Rudd also played down the potential impact of excluding students from net migration figures, saying: \"It's a complete red herring to talk about taking students out of those numbers and it making a big impact.\" This was because, in theory, roughly the same numbers of students should be leaving the UK at the end of their courses as are arriving each year. Official figures out last month show EU migrants make up more than one in 10 manufacturing sector workers in the UK. The government has promised new migration controls after the UK leaves the EU, when freedom of movement rules will no longer apply, but it has yet to set out the precise model it will adopt. Labour says it accepts that the principle of the free movement of people - which EU leaders say goes hand-in-hand with single market membership - would have to end after Brexit. But shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer has said new immigration controls should not be the \"overarching priority\" as the UK leaves. UKIP has said that Mrs May's failure to reduce net migration to less than 100,000 while she was home secretary suggests that she could yet \"back slide\" on delivering Brexit.",

Michael Gunn, a retired chartered accountant, wants to spend some of it on a new roof for the church hall. But in defiance of experts, he also wants to use the money for a transatlantic cruise. The changes take effect on Bank Holiday Monday, so Mr Gunn will receive the payment on Tuesday morning. \"I had no idea they'd whisk me into the limelight, and say I am the first,\" he told the BBC. \"But I don't mind that.\" Initially he wants to donate cash to the fund for the church hall roof - in the village of Newton Poppleford - after it burnt down in a fire. But later in the year he is planning to take his wife across the Atlantic on board the Queen Mary Two. Mr Gunn was not prepared to say how much he would be taking out of his pension pot, but he has taken care to heed warnings about tax bills. \"What I like about this is that you are totally in charge of how much tax you are exposed to - to stay within a lower tax band,\" he said. Last week the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said thousands of people withdrawing money might find themselves paying much more tax than they needed to. Other experts have pointed out that, in any case, people taking out cash will have to pay what is called \"emergency tax\". Unless individuals can show a P45 tax form, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) will treat any payments as if they are a new monthly salary. In other words, they will charge tax on the basis that the new income is repeated every month for a year. So anyone cashing in a pension of \u00c2\u00a318,000 - assuming nothing is taken tax-free- would be charged an immediate tax bill of \u00c2\u00a36,592. Those in that position will have to reclaim the tax using forms P50 or P53. However HMRC has promised they will get the money back within a month. Meanwhile, hundreds of staff from Citizens Advice - and Citizens Advice Scotland - are preparing to offer free face-to-face interviews with anyone who needs help, from Tuesday. Those aged 55 or over can go to one of 500 offices in England and Wales, or 90 in Scotland. Those living in very remote areas of Scotland can arrange home visits. But customers will only receive \"guidance\", not advice. \"What we don't do is provide any details of which companies people can go to for pensions - or which particular products,\" said Richard Chilton, one of those who will be conducting the interviews. \"But we provide guidance on what the options are,\" he said. Anyone wanting to book an interview, or receive telephone guidance, should call the Pension Wise service, on 030 0330 1001. Are you planning to cash in your pension?

        "article": "Decriminalising TV licence fee evasion could close BBC channels, the corporation's strategy director has warned. James Purnell said it would increase non-payment and cost the BBC \u00a3200m. The sum is the equivalent of BBC Four, CBBC and CBeebies, which would have to be taken off air, Mr Purnell said at an event to  relaunch the iPlayer service. Culture Secretary Maria Miller said the move should be discussed during talks to renew the BBC's charter before 2017. Mr Purnell, who previously held the post in the Labour government, said \"it would be a huge risk to do it now\". \"The choice would be: either we take those services off or the government would have to have a higher licence fee,\" he said in reference to BBC Four - the arts and culture channel - and the BBC's children's stations. He argued decriminalisation would inevitably lead to greater non-payment of the TV licence, which would force an increase in the fee. It is currently \u00a3145.50 and has been frozen at that annual amount since 2010. It is needed to watch or record live broadcasts on any device. In 2012 about 155,000 people were convicted and fined for not paying the licence fee, while there were some 180,000 prosecutions. Mr Purnell added downgrading licence fee evasion to a civil offence would penalise the poor. \"Either you have a low penalty - in which case the evasion rates would go up and everyone would have to pay a higher licence fee - or a penalty which is higher and more difficult to pay,\" he said. The BBC has previously said \"legislation is a matter for the government\". \"Just a 1% increase in evasion would lead to the loss of around \u00a335m, the equivalent of around 10 BBC local radio stations,\" it added. The government has floated the idea to ease pressure on the courts system. But it will not be discussed before charter renewal talks - which determine how the BBC is funded what it does and how it is managed. The current BBC charter runs out in 2016. Meanwhile, Labour MP John McDonnell has tabled an Early Day Motion in parliament calling on the BBC to reverse its decision to close BBC Three as a television channel. The motion stated BBC Three has been the home of programmes including Gavin and Stacey, and raised fears changes could lead to compulsory redundancies. It added the BBC should receive a licence fee increase that tracks inflation when the corporation's charter is renewed next year.",

Two reports, published in November, criticised the regulator at the time for failing to take action. One of those reports, by barrister Andrew Green QC, said regulators should consider banning 10 former HBOS executives. A new investigation has now been announced by regulators. \"The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) have decided to start investigations into certain former HBOS senior managers,\" the regulators said. \"These investigations will determine whether or not any prohibition proceedings should be commenced against them. The FCA and PRA continue to review materials with a view to making further decisions regarding other former HBOS senior managers.\" No details are being given as to the exact nature of the investigations, who is being investigated, or the timeframe of the inquiry. A Bank of England/FCA report examined the failure of HBOS, while Mr Green examined decisions taken by the Financial Services Authority, the City regulator at the time of the HBOS demise. Both were published in November. So far the only person to have been banned is Peter Cummings, who was previously the head of corporate lending at HBOS. In 2012, he was fined \u00c2\u00a3500,000, and banned from senior positions in banking. In his report, Mr Green suggested that the Bank of England's PRA and the FCA should consider prohibition proceedings against former executives. That included Andy Hornby, HBOS chief executive from 2006 to 2009. Mr Green said the FSA was \"misguided\" when it took the decision not to take action against Mr Hornby. Other former HBOS executives named in the report included Lord Stevenson, and Mike Ellis, the former group finance director at HBOS. Lindsay Mackay, the head of HBOS's Treasury division from 2004, could also be banned, November's report said. James Crosby, HBOS chief executive from 2001 to 2006, has retired. He gave up his knighthood in 2009, and surrendered part of his pension. Eight former non-executive directors of HBOS were criticised in the report, although they said they disagreed with its findings. The eight, including Lord Stevenson and Carphone Warehouse founder Sir Charles Dunstone, said the report had downplayed the \"unforeseeable\" effects of the financial crisis.",

        "article": "Swagata Sen likes her home to look good. In particular, she likes fancy china and plates, and is happy to show off her latest purchase. She ordered a platter online, and took it out of the bubble wrap excitedly. She bought that item, and some more china, toiletries and a bike, on a cashback website so she is expecting about \u00a314 to be paid back to her. But Ms Sen might have to be patient. It will take up to four months for her to be paid. Cashback sites are a simple idea. Instead of going directly to a shop, you access a retailer's online store through a link from a cashback website. You still receive your item directly from the retailer, but you also get some money from the cashback website. It is often a percentage of the total price you paid. The sites have links to retailers of everything from groceries and toiletries, to insurance policies and broadband deals. But Ms Sen has not actually had any money back yet. \"I thought it was going to be as easy as one-two-three, just make the purchase to the website and get the cash back the next day,\" she said. \"But that didn't happen. It's been well over a month and I'm still waiting for it.\" Ms Sen thinks the website is not clear enough about how long that wait will be. \"I have no idea how long it's going to take me to get the cash back,\" she said. She went through one of the biggest cashback sites, Quidco. It says it has more than 2 million members in the UK, and that the average user can make \u00a3262 a year. That is small change for its more committed users. Quidco says more than a hundred of them have made over \u00a310,000. But, like all cashback websites, its customers can face long waits for their money to start coming in. Andy Oldham is the company's managing director and said every attempt is made to be clear and transparent. \"That's the whole ethos of the site,\" he said. \"On every single merchant page, we've got statistics that show the time it takes for those transactions to be paid out.\" For example, with the bike Ms Sen bought, the information about the length of time is displayed underneath the deal. We pointed this out to Ms Sen, who said she had never noticed the warning before. She thinks that four months is too long to wait for her money. \"It's right down the bottom of the page,\" she said. \"Look how light the shade of the font is. It's just not prominent enough. They need to make it clearer,\" she added. Despite all this, she says she will carry on using cashback websites. \"My attitude is, it's better than getting no money back at all,\" she said. Quidco's Andy Oldham said he would take Ms Sen's feedback on board. He admitted there was \"quite possibly\" an argument for rethinking how this information is shown on the website. Mr Oldham maintains that it is impossible to give an average waiting time, because it depends on different retailers and products. So, if you are buying something like food, that will be consumed quickly, you should be paid relatively quickly. On the other hand, if you book a holiday six months in advance, you will not be paid until after you come home. Mr Oldham says it was important that customers realised that cashback arrangements do not pay out immediately. \"We're very much dependent on the retailer paying us the advertising commission before we pay it back to the consumer,\" he pointed out. Another site, TopCashBack, says it works hard to manage consumers' expectations about how long it takes to get their money. But on average, those customers may have to wait 12 weeks for their money to clear into their accounts. There are other things to be aware of if you sign up to a cashback website. Some, like Quidco, charge an annual fee while others take a cut out of your commission. Personal finance expert Sarah Pennells, from the website Savvywoman, says there are dozens of sites to pick from, so it is important to shop around to find the best one for you. \"The first thing is to look at how much cash you're going to get back on the various deals and secondly, look at how they're going to pay you,\" she said. \"Some pay by cheque, others by bank transfer, some ask you to set up a PayPal account. \"The last thing, and possibly most important thing, is don't just focus on the cashback deal. It's got to be the right deal or buy in the first place,\" she added.",

        "article": "A letting agency has been paid more than \u00a35.5m in housing benefit after its owner set up a charity to help the homeless, the BBC has learned. Investing Solutions received those benefit payments over the past two years by finding properties for single homeless men. The charity, Fresh Start Housing, finds clients from London homeless charities. Neither the charity nor the company act illegally, but a homeless group says the relationship is \"a new low\". Investing Solutions said \"the bulk\" of their rents get passed to private landlords, while Fresh Start said they referred clients to both Investing Solutions and private landlords. The letting agent makes money by putting several unrelated people in one house and charging housing benefit for each person, rather than the property. Therefore, the total benefit payout is higher than the rent fee passed on to the property's landlord. Both Investing Solutions and Fresh Start are based in the same building, a storage unit in south London. Records held at Companies House show Investing Solutions was set up in 2002 by Samir Patel, who then set up Fresh Start Housing in 2010. The documents say the charity would help \"the needs of current and ex-offenders with a wider goal to reduce poverty, sickness and distress\". Operating across seven London boroughs, Investing Solutions is one of the largest recipients of housing benefit in the UK, making the venture hugely profitable. In one property we visited, Investing Solutions was claiming \u00a32,114 per month in housing benefit for two tenants. The owner of the house was getting \u00a31,150 per month, giving the agency an annual gross profit of \u00a311,568 on the one property. The company focuses on providing housing to single homeless men over the age of 35, saying that is because this is the group facing \"the greatest challenges in accessing accommodation\". But housing benefit legislation allows people aged 35 and over to be housed in private rather than shared accommodation. In the boroughs in which Investing Solutions operates, that means they can charge up to \u00a3260 per week for each private room. One of the tenants, Nigel McCann, was living in a homeless shelter when he was referred to Fresh Start Housing. They passed him to Investing Solutions who housed him in several properties that he describes as wholly unsuitable - various problems included lack of heating and hot water, rats and damp. He says he had to remove 28 bags of rubbish from one house to begin to make it habitable. Mr McCann said he became aware of how profitable Investing Solutions was after he did some work for them in 2014. \"It's all about the money, it's not about the people,\" he added. \"I thought inspections would be made.\" Nearly half the money that Investing Solutions has received over the past two years has been paid by Wandsworth Council in south London, which has paid the lettings agency more than \u00a32.1m. The council said it has a \"dedicated Private Sector Housing Team who provide specialist advice to both landlords and tenants to ensure the private rented sector in the borough is safe, secure and affordable\". Matt Downie, of homeless charity Crisis, said: \"We've heard many examples of poor practice amongst letting agents as well as good practice. But this idea of having a charity tacked on to poor practice is a new low.\" Samir Patel said in a statement that Fresh Start Housing was an independent charity with its own board of trustees. He also said the majority of the properties used were sourced from private sector landlords \"who, to make exceedingly clear, own the properties. The simple point being, the bulk of the rents gets passed to our private sector landlord clients\". He also said his company was \"genuinely concerned by some of your allegations concerning the state of one of our landlord client's property\". Fresh Start Housing told us it had housed 788 homeless people since it was founded and 222 homeless people in the last 12 months, including re-housed tenants. It also said it did not have \"authority from the relevant parties\" to reveal how many were housed with Investing Solutions. A spokeswoman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said local authorities were responsible for \"rigorously safe-guarding taxpayers' money, with dedicated investigations and inspection teams for private sector housing\".",

When I caught up with Gavin Robinson in the leafy streets just outside the Stormont estate he had his DUP colleagues Arlene Foster, Lord Morrow and Ian McCrea for company. But there's no protection from a barking dog - or its owner. At one doorstep the householder told the DUP candidate not to worry,  his animal didn't bite, before adding rather worryingly \"unless I tell him to\". The pet owner then tackled Gavin Robinson about the pact agreed between the DUP and the Ulster Unionists in East Belfast, telling him \"I didn't like you joining up with two parties together against Naomi\". The candidate responded that the deal had been decided \"over my head\". On another doorstep not far away another candidate, Alliance's Naomi Long came across another over excited dog, named Chuckie. \"Don't worry\" the lady who answered the door assured her, \"Chuckie's an Alliance supporter\". Naomi Long's victory over the DUP leader Peter Robinson, who held East Belfast for 30 years, was the big surprise of the 2010 election. Alliance benefited from an anti-Robinson mood after TV investigations into his family's business dealings and a decision by some loyalists to lend their votes to Ms Long. But since then the Alliance MP has found herself on the receiving end of death threats as a result of the Belfast council Union Flag dispute. She told me the intimidation remains a regular occurrence - indeed she was hit by a projectile just this week after visiting a nail salon which had been targeted by racist arsonists. Whilst condemning that kind of behaviour, unionists argue that Alliance bears responsibility for its own decisions in limiting the flying of the Union flag over Belfast City Hall. Now Gavin Robinson, a namesake but not a relation of the DUP leader, has high hopes of winning East Belfast back for unionism. The man with the barking dog might not like the pact, but others I talked to on the streets of East Belfast think unionists should have been co-operating long ago. Gavin Robinson insists the pact has been broadly welcomed. But Naomi Long claims it has galvanised some Ulster Unionists to back her rather than let their choices be dictated by the unionist leaders. Four others are competing for votes in East Belfast. They are Sinn Fein's Niall \u00c3\u201c Donnghaile, the SDLP's Mary Muldoon, the Greens' Ross Brown and the Conservative Neil Wilson. But it's the DUP Alliance battle which is box office - something underlined by the large audience which packed out the Strand Cinema in East Belfast to watch the two frontrunners go head to head. The Slugger O'Toole election debate wasn't quite the thriller some might have hoped for. Both Naomi Long and Gavin Robinson were at pains to reject suggestions they can't stand each other. Gavin Robinson also distanced himself from remarks by his party leader that Ms Long she should \"dry her eyes\" rather than complaining about the unionist pact. The candidates differed about issues like the extent of paramilitary racketeering or the impact a future withdrawal from the European Union might have on the local aircraft industry. Afterwards both sides claimed victory. The audience were then ushered out to make way for the cinema's late showing \"Fast and Furious 7\", a title which could be adopted for the closely fought and sometimes heated contest in East Belfast.",

Walkouts in the NHS are quite different from other sectors. When tube drivers, council staff or teachers strike the aim is to cause disruption. It is the first rule of industrial action: make your contribution count. However, the terms of engagement are somewhat different when NHS workers take part. While unions members want to make a point, they commit to not harming urgent and emergency services. Ahead of this week's action local union officials held talks with managers to plan services - as they did before the walkout on 17 October. It means there are likely to have been many staff in work who supported the strike but have agreed to keep working. Midwives are a classic example of this. The Royal College of Midwives has promised to keep maternity units running and so well over half of their members are believed to have worked. And even where staff have walked out, there appears to have been a willingness to leave the picket lines when there has been a need. In a word, pay. Ministers in England and Northern Ireland have awarded NHS staff a 1% increase, but only for those without automatic progression-in-the-job rises. These, designed to reward professional development, are given to about half of staff and are worth 3% a year on average. What is more, the offer is \"non-consolidated\", which means it is taken away at the end of the year, meaning their pay packet returns back to the 2013-14 level, and does not count towards staff pensions. An independent pay review board had said the 1% increase should be across the board and paid in full as normal. Next year it has been suggested those not getting a progression-in-the job rise get 2%, but again it should be non-consolidated. But in Scotland a 1% pay rise was given to everyone and in Wales a deal was reached last week after ministers agreed to pay 1% next year, while giving extra help to the lowest paid this year. It means the disruption during both strikes seems to have been limited to areas such as outpatient appointments and community clinics. And it is why unions are able to claim strong support for the walkout, while NHS England releases figures suggesting only about 12,500 staff - about one in 35 - did not turn up for work. But with the strike now ended, attention turns to what happens next. The simple answer is a period of work-to-rule. Members from the nine unions involved in the walkout are expected to take steps such as refusing to do unpaid overtime and insisting on taking their breaks. They may be joined by another two unions. However, as far as an end to this dispute, a solution seems some way off. As the walkout was coming to an end, unions were already telling me they would be sitting down to discuss future action. There was a meeting between the strike in October and this one, but it is thought little progress was made with the government maintaining giving a 1% pay rise on top of the progression-in-the-job pay rises was simply not affordable. Unions have been told that they are free to come up with another solution, but that there is no more money for pay. That means making some kind of compromise on the progression-in-the-job element. These can be extremely lucrative - for senior nurses and midwives they are worth ??10,000 - so understandably staff are unwilling to give them up. But to understand the cause of this dispute you really need to go back to 2009. That was the year the then NHS chief executive Sir David Nicholson set the health service an ambitious savings target. The NHS was told to save ??20bn by 2014 - later pushed back to 2015. Sir David was adamant, though, it could not simply be achieved through cuts, but rather it had to come from efficiency savings. It works out as a productivity gain of between 4% and 5% a year - something the health service had never done before. Unsurprisingly, it has turned out to be just as difficult as expected. A report by MPs earlier this year showed significant inroads had been made, but the majority of these had not come from efficiency savings. Instead, the NHS had relied on \"quick fixes\" - namely pay restraint. Over the last four years there have been two years of freezes and two of small rises. That has had a significant impact on the pockets of health workers. Figures from Unison suggest health worker pay has fallen by 10% during this period once inflation is taken into account. But it is easy to understand - in simple money terms at least - why ministers have adopted such an approach. About 40% of the budget is spent on pay and with the NHS facing a ??30bn hole in its finances by 2020, the government is under pressure to make resources stretch as far as they can. That said, ministers know they face a tricky dilemma. Governments tend to avoid getting into disputes with health workers - public opinion normally sides with them - and so a lengthy period of industrial action ahead of an election will be something ministers will be keen to avoid. Like all pay disputes, it promises to be a game of brinkmanship. But one in which the stakes could not be higher.",

The dispute is ongoing, with unions planning a work-to-rule and possible future action.

Van Gaal, 65, has been out of work since being sacked by United hours after winning the FA Cup in May 2016. \"I thought maybe I would stop, then I thought it would be a sabbatical, but now I do not think I will return to coaching,\" Van Gaal was quoted as saying in Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf. Van Gaal also had spells in charge of Ajax, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and AZ. He made the announcement on Monday after receiving a lifetime achievement award from the Dutch government for his contribution to football. He cited family issues for his decision, with De Telegraaf saying it was partly motivated by the sudden death of his daughter's husband last month. \"So much has happened in my family, you become a human being again with your nose pressed to the facts,\" he added. The Dutchman also revealed he turned down lucrative offers to continue his coaching career in the Far East. Media playback is not supported on this device Van Gaal played as a midfielder for Ajax, Royal Antwerp, Telstar, Sparta Rotterdam and AZ between 1972 and 1987 before moving into coaching, first as an assistant at AZ followed by the same role at Ajax. He replaced Leo Beenhakker as Ajax head coach in 1991 and went on to preside over a period of sustained success, winning the Dutch league title on three occasions as well as the 1992 Uefa Cup and the 1995 Champions League title. Van Gaal was asked to emulate that success at Spanish giants Barcelona. He inherited Bobby Robson's side in 1997 and led them to two successive La Liga titles and the Copa del Rey. His country came calling in 2000, but his first stint in charge lasted less than two years when Netherlands failed to qualify for the 2002 World Cup, the first time they had missed the competition since 1986. The Dutchman's second spell at Barcelona was even shorter - eight months - as he left midway through the season with the club hovering just above the relegation zone. Media playback is not supported on this device He then guided AZ Alkmaar to the 2005-06 Eredivisie title before moving to the Bundesliga, where he helped Bayern Munich to the 2009-10 Bundesliga title. The Dutch national side approached Van Gaal again in 2012 and this time the Netherlands became one of the first two European countries, along with Italy, to qualify for Brazil 2014, where they finished in third place. After much speculation, he joined United in May 2014, signing a three-year contract to succeed David Moyes. However, United replaced him with Jose Mourinho after just two years following a fifth-placed Premier League finish in the 2015-16 season, with a first FA Cup triumph since 2004 not sufficient to save him.",

        "article": "For many Ugandans, the gold found deep underground in the hills of Mubende District was a lifeline. Over the past five years, an estimated 70,000 people have left their homes and moved to the gold fields, seeking - if not their fortunes - a way of feeding their families. When I visited Mubende a few weeks ago the dusty hillside was crawling with activity, as if an imaginary film director had shouted \"action\" on the set of an old Western movie. Everywhere you looked, people were busy. Young men with muddy faces climbed out of pits 150 metres deep, hauling huge sacks of rubble; others were busy breaking down clumps of rock, loading up trucks or panning for gold. Women stood in dark puddles, swishing water around plastic tubs, closely watching for a flash of yellow. \"In our culture it's taboo for women to go down the pit,\" the mine chairman told me. \"They believe when they go down there, the gold disappears.\" Instead, several women were working in the many restaurants and shops that had sprung up in the nearby camp. They were stalls selling bananas, chicken and yoghurt. There was also a medical clinic, some churches and a mosque on site. The houses were made of blue plastic sheeting, wood and corrugated iron - the typical shanty houses that I've seen elsewhere in Africa. I visit the local bar, where music is playing - until the power goes off. Men worked in the mines 24 hours a day, but it was clear the operation was completely unregulated. There wasn't a helmet to be seen, and some of the workers weren't wearing any shoes. But no one I met seemed worried by the long hours or poor conditions. Florence Nampijja, who used to sell second-hand clothes, said her life had changed considerably since she joined the gold rush. \"With good panning, I'm able to look after my four children and my extended family,\" she said. \"I hope to buy land and put up a good house for my children, feed them well, and send them to better schools.\" Pit owner Ivan Kauma Male enthusiastically showed me around the site. He had bigger dreams. \"When I find gold most of my wishes will be completed,\" he told me. \"Like driving a Porsche car, putting up good houses, and sending my children to good schools.\" \"This is something I've invested in for two and a half years. So I want to get my money out of it.\" But those dreams have been put on hold. A few days ago Ugandan soldiers armed with tear gas shut down the Mubende mines. They were acting on the instructions of the country's government. The miners and their families were told they had just hours to evacuate the area. Many are still looking for a way to get home. The mines are a four-hour drive from the capital Kampala, and the only road in is a bumpy dirt track. \"People are stranded on the road with mattresses, jerry cans, saucepans and children,\" Ivan told me, speaking on the phone from a nearby village. The Ugandan government issued a statement blaming the shutdown on unsafe mining practices, and the presence of foreigners in the camps. The miners say the vast majority of people living in the camps are Ugandan. But they acknowledge the mining was illegal. No one had a license. Mark Asaph Jjombwe heads up the Artisinal and Small Scale Miners Association. \"The association tried to get a license, although they've not yet replied to us,\" he says. The miners say Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni knew about the illegal mining, but chose to ignore it. Mark explains: \"He knows we cannot dig the big gold. So he says, 'You can have those petty, petty ones. My people, you go and try your luck'.\" But that appears to be over for now at least. A statement from Uganda's Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development said the miners will be registered over the next three months, and the industry will be regulated. But the miners are sceptical. \"The government believes the investors are going to bring a pack of money, more than the artisans who can actually generate some income for their children,\" says Ivan. \"In Uganda we are jobless. I hold a degree in electrical engineering. It's not because I don't want to do my work, but they cannot pay me.\" The watchdog Global Witness recently criticised the Ugandan mining industry, describing it as \"infested with corruption from bottom to top\". The group accused a former government minister of processing and exporting hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of gold. The mines in Mubende District had meant the country's riches weren't just in the hands of the elite. Now, thousands of Ugandans are jobless again.",

The Tayside outfit lost both their games on their maiden outing at the showpiece finals in Nottingham over the weekend. But the Stars showed up well in the 4-2 semi-final defeat to Cardiff Devils and the 15-8 third-place match loss to Belfast Giants. \"It's been a great experience for our guys and hopefully next year we can come back here and learn from it, like Cardiff did,\" LeFebvre said. \"I had some time to reflect on Saturday's performance against Cardiff and I'm so proud of my players. It was a dream start for us to go 2-0 up in the first period. \"It was always going to be a tough task keeping that pace up all game against a team like the Devils, who are rightfully league champions. \"But to be the first team from Dundee to make it to this weekend, it's not to be sniffed at and I'm proud of that.\" Dundee could hold their heads high after a great performance against the Devils in Saturday's semi-final, even if it was to end in a 4-2 defeat. Vinny Scarsella teed up Kevin Hart on the blue line and he fired his effort past Devils goalie Ben Bowns to open the scoring. Stars then went two up as Brett Switzer's low diagonal shot beat Bowns at his bottom right hard corner. The Devils started to claw their way back into the game six minutes into the second period as Joey Haddad found space in front of Dundee's goal to finish. The EIHL champions pulled level when Mark Louis reacted quickest to tuck in an equaliser. Devils completed the comeback with nine minutes left as Joey Martin put them 3-2 ahead before Andrew Hotham confirmed their place in Sunday's final with a late empty-net goal. It meant an early start on Sunday for the Stars who had to face fellow beaten semi-finalists Belfast Giants, who had gone down 2-0 to eventual play-off winners Sheffield Steelers. The sides shared 23 goals with Justin Faryna netting two for Dundee, while Kevin Bruijsten, Joey Sides, Mikael Lidhammar, Matt White, Vinny Scarsella and Craig Moore were also on target for Stars.

        "article": "\"It's all about taking an opportunity in a crisis,\" says the outgoing Conservative leader of Melton Borough Council. Byron Rhodes is taking me around the modern council headquarters. It's full of light. It's busy. The building has regenerated the area around Melton Mowbray's railway station, once a muddy pot-holed piece of wasteland where those in the know parked for free. Now the council offices link the station to a park and the town centre. It was partly paid for with insurance money after a fire destroyed the old offices on the other side of town. A supermarket moved in to replace it and helped with the money too, putting the council on a firm financial footing. But that was four years ago and the crisis is a different one today. It's being experienced by all local authorities - cuts in central government funding which threaten the services they provide. Mr Rhodes is also deputy leader of Leicestershire County Council, with responsibility for finance. Leicestershire is historically the poorest funded council in the country because of a quirk of Whitehall recalculations, going back a quarter of a century since the poll tax, or community charge, was scrapped. At the moment councils get income from council tax, a share of the business rates, any income they generate themselves from services plus a grant from central government. It's the grant cut which is causing them grief. What's called the \"core funding\" is worked out by the number of homes multiplied by a set amount. And each authority has a different value set per dwelling. If we look at Surrey, which is top of the table, the amount will be \u00a31,686 by 2019/20. Nottinghamshire is mid-table at \u00a31,482, Derbyshire is in the lower reaches with \u00a31,422 per dwelling and then comes Leicestershire at \u00a31,354. \"The funding system is chaotic,\" says Byron Rhodes. \"It doesn't reflect real need. Look at Oxfordshire which is an interesting example,\" he says with a glint in his eye. Could he possibly be referring to the prime ministerial plea to the county council about cutbacks to services there? \"If we had the same funding as Oxfordshire, we'd have \u00a350m a year extra. If we had the same as Surrey, we'd have \u00a3100m more. We'd be partying everyday if we had that kind of money.\" Leicestershire have been helped with a small share of what's been called transitional funding - about \u00a3300m to help councils following pressure from Conservative MPs. Think back to the vote on Sunday trading. With a majority of only  17 in the Commons, the Conservatives lost the vote when 20 odd rebelled. Last month there would've been another rebellion, including some of our own Tory MPs in the East Midlands, if something wasn't done to improve the local government finance settlement over the next four years. The money has gone largely to shire counties. Leicestershire got \u00a36.6m spread over two years, enough to save some services from closure. But it's a drop in the ocean for an authority with a \u00a319m black hole in the budget every year after the latest cutbacks. Labour have protested that 83% of the councils getting transition funding are Conservative-run. Many Labour-run authorities such as Derby, Leicester and Nottingham, got nothing. The leader of Derby City Council, Ranjit Banwait, has launched a \"fair funding for Derby\" campaign. He says the allocation of government funding is unfair and political and the cuts they're having to impose on leisure services and culture are devastating. \"Now they are threatening our ability to protect the vulnerable and our ability to function is under threat,\" said Mr Banwait. Back in Melton Mowbray, Byron Rhodes has some sympathy for the Labour council in Derby. \"Derby probably have some greater needs,\" he says. But once more he is talking about seizing an opportunity in a crisis. Leicestershire's finance team are working on a submission to put to the government with good arguments on how to restructure the way funds are allocated. \"We're going to do it. We're going to work up a system which is fairer.\" He has the backing of local MPs and is talking to neighbouring authorities. And with a hand out to Derby, he says: \"If they want to talk to us about how to improve things I'm happy to speak to them.\" It's a crucial time to get things right. The government is moving to a system where, by 2020, the grant will go. Councils will instead get an allocation of funds from the business rates instead. How they come up a formula for doing that in a fair way, which helps those authorities with most need, is the next challenge.",

        "article": "There are a few people who would love to be standing in Virat Kohli's shoes this weekend, leading their national team into the final of Champions Trophy, and there is no doubt the captain of India will be relishing the prospect of Sunday's final against Pakistan at The Oval. Eoin Morgan of England, Steve Smith of Australia and Kane Williamson of New Zealand are three great cricketers and captains who will be watching the final from the sidelines, perhaps pondering the often tiny margins between victory and defeat in these tournaments. As South Africa captain, I know how they feel. Yet while the disappointed captains of eliminated teams must accept the reality of recriminations and a social media backlash, Virat has managed to guide his team through to the final and now, once again, stands centre stage for the showpiece occasion. At 28, he is at the peak of his powers, surely the outstanding cricketer in the world today. I have been privileged to play alongside him in the last six Indian Premier League tournaments and, as his team-mate at Royal Challengers Bangalore, have seen at first hand not only his extraordinary skill as a batsman but also the energy and intensity that he brings to the game. He is a consummate surgeon at the crease, intensely focussed, working hard, playing the ball into gaps in the field and staying calm under pressure. He is always judging the right time to consolidate and the right time to seize a game by the scruff of the neck. The sheer volume of his runs leaves no room for debate: Virat has scored 8,008 runs in 183 one-day internationals, at an average of 54.47, and this week moved to the top of the ICC rankings of ODI batsmen. He has found his best form in this tournament, scoring an unbeaten 81 in India's opening win over Pakistan, adding an unbeaten 76 in the do-or-die victory over South Africa, and compiling a clinical and commanding 96 not out in the semi-final victory over Bangladesh. India's batting order is decorated with many brilliant talents, but the Pakistan bowlers will realise the paramount importance of controlling Virat on Sunday. He has been blessed with wonderful natural talent but, as ever among high achievers, his talent is underpinned by a willingness to work hard. Unseen, he is determined and relentless in training, remaining in the nets as long as necessary to ensure he feels comfortable with every aspect of his game. I have watched him rehearse his strokes over and over again, until sweat is pouring from his brow, never stopping until he is satisfied. Beyond the golden talent and the iron determination, Virat has learned how to cope with the pressures of his exalted position. If you drive into almost any city in India, you will see his face appear on every other billboard. Being the most marketable and possibly the most popular personality in a nation of 1.3bn people brings its own pressures: he simply cannot move without being begged for a 'selfie' and his every move, word and even gesture is relentlessly reported in print, electronic and social media. Twitter whirred when he stuck out his tongue to celebrate a wicket against Bangladesh. Virat has learned to live with these realities... and also to accept the burden of unrealistic expectation that he should score runs every time he reaches the crease, and that his team should win every time they take the field. When things don't go well - and, unfortunately, for Virat as for anyone else, things don't always go well - he falls back on his intense commitment and works ever harder until he turns the corner and meets the excessively high expectations. There were occasions earlier in his career when his determination to succeed spilled over into outbursts anger and volatility on the field, but such incidents are rare now. He has evolved into the very model of a calm, clinical and confident professional cricketer, seemingly in control of every situation. Intense and serious in matches and at practice, he retains the invaluable ability to switch off from the game, relaxing, laughing and joking at every opportunity. He enjoys calling people by playful nicknames and he can find humour in almost every situation, even when we are spending hour after hour at another photo shoot, waiting for the photographer to be ready, then being told how and where to pose, then waiting some more, then being told we have to start the process all over again. While some of his team-mates are getting frustrated and struggling to be patient and composed, Virat will find something funny and deftly defuse the situation. So he continues to thrive, and so his Indian team continue to enjoy remarkably consistent success at ICC tournaments. Not long ago, on the morning after an away match in the Indian Premier League, I arrived at breakfast in the hotel to find Virat sitting on his own. We started chatting about the game of cricket, a little about the pressures and the expectations... but mostly we spoke about the fantastic privilege to play for and to captain your country, and we agreed that we should savour every moment of what, to be honest, remains a special and wonderful way to make a living. Virat is five years younger than me, so I asked him: \"How long do you think you will keep playing the game?\" He responded instantly, eyes alight. \"I'm going to play forever,\" he said, his face breaking into a broad smile. And so 'forever' continues on Sunday at The Oval.",

        "article": "Archimedes did it in the bath, Tesla with a walking stick and the father of the sticky note had his flash of inspiration while singing in church - or so legend has it. Yet today we expect new inventions to be born in anonymous laboratories after the submission of several grant proposals. But the age of the home-grown inventor may not be over. David Williams and John Dingley are consultant anaesthetists at Morriston Hospital in Swansea. Their moment of genius came in their garages while tinkering with glue-guns and car-body filler. Inspired by Trevor Baylis's wind-up radio, they wondered \"almost jokingly\" whether it might be possible to make something similarly economical and easy-to-use in the medical world. And having worked in remote settings, Dr Williams was aware of how crucial equipment that does not require a constant power source could be. In Zambia he had noticed entire operating theatres remaining unused because of a lack of replacement light bulbs or a reliable mains power supply. So the doctors set themselves the challenge of inventing essential kit for the doctor's bag on a budget. And after a week spent attacking conventional medical equipment with power tools, they had the first prototype of a device which has the potential to save lives. The ShakerScope is a light source which can be quickly adapted to look in people's eyes, ears and throats. But unlike regular devices it does not need batteries. Dr Patrick Finlay, of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers said: \"According to the World Health Organisation, 95% of medical devices fail to work in developing countries. Often designers in the West don't understand the conditions elsewhere. \"This type of invention is very important. With these scopes you would normally need three different instruments for each examination, each one requiring batteries. For low income countries this is a joke. \" At the core of the ShakerScope is a powerful moveable magnet, surrounded by a coil of wire. As noted by Michael Faraday in 1831, as the magnet moves over the wire the magnetic field induces an electric current in the coil. And shaking the ShakerScope for 30 seconds produces enough current to light the device for three minutes. \"That might not sound like long but it is more than enough time for most ear or eye examinations or to insert tracheal tubes,\" Dr Williams said. Once the scope is shaken the charge can be stored for many weeks. And instead of using a conventional light bulb, it uses a light emitting diode which can last up to 10,000 hours. ColaLife Donkey Ambulance CentriCycle ColaLife Air bed invention is 'donkey ambulance' CentriCycle The team has designed changeable heads allowing it be converted into a number of devices. One of its most promising uses so far has been as a laryngoscope -  an instrument which lights-up the back of the mouth allowing anaesthetists to insert breathing tubes when people are unable to breathe for themselves. It has already been tested in military hospitals in Afghanistan, in Uganda and after the earthquake in Haiti in 2010. \"In Haiti we saw a lady with a neck injury who urgently needed a tracheal tube to help stabilise her. There were no other functioning laryngoscopes close by and the ShakerScope worked well despite the difficult case,\" said Dr Williams. According to Dr Williams the project has been a series of steep learning curves. \"Having the good idea is the easy part. Making it into a reality required an almost obsessive degree of dedication,\" he said. In the early days the doctors tried to do as much as possible from home - from teaching themselves microelectronics to perfecting their computer-aided design skills. Luckily for Dr Williams, his wife is a sculptor who works on large pieces of metal. He has been known to borrow her workshop, saws and glue-gun on many occasions. But he says he learned very early on that the kitchen may not be the best place to melt plastics. Dr Jerry Nolan, a consultant anaesthetist at Bath Royal United NHS Trust, who was not involved in the research said: \"The ShakerScope has the potential to be invaluable in remote locations. \"That they have taught themselves the skills to get a final version near to market is even more remarkable and surely disproves the adage doctors make poor businessmen.\" The device is one of many frugal, home-grown devices recently showcased at the  Institution of Mechanical Engineers in the UK. Having made several fully-functioning versions tested across the world, the doctors say they recently reached the limit of their technical abilities, and passed on further manufacturing and design to a larger company. But these anaesthetists have returned to their sheds and have many other possible irons in the fire.",
        "target": "Two doctors, David Williams and John Dingley, created a medical device called the ShakerScope, which is a light source that can be used to examine patients' eyes, ears, and throats without the need for batteries. The device uses a magnet and a coil of wire to generate electricity, which is stored and can be used to light the device for three minutes after being shaken for 30 seconds. The ShakerScope has been tested in various locations, including military hospitals in Afghanistan and Uganda, and was used to help stabilize a patient with a neck injury in Haiti. The doctors taught themselves microelectronics and computer-aided design skills to create the device, and have since passed on the manufacturing and design to a larger company.",

        "article": "After the bomb attacks on London in July 2005, Tony Blair summoned the media to Downing Street for a news conference. \"The rules of the game are changing,\" the prime minister declared. And he launched a 12-point plan of tough measures to deal with the threat of terrorism. I can remember writing them all down in my notebook and wondering when this bewildering list of policies was going to end. Chaos ensued. Opposition parties protested they had not been consulted. The then Labour chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee dismissed the policies as \"half-baked\". And Mr Blair went on holiday leaving his Home Secretary, Charles Clarke, to pick up the pieces. Day after day, there were emergency news conferences as the policies were clarified, rewritten and embellished. Some were quietly forgotten - such as new powers to close mosques - and others provoked divisive parliamentary battles, such as allowing the police 90 days to detain terror suspects without charge. The attacks transformed the politics of the summer. But the key point is this: Mr Blair had already won his third election in May with a healthy majority of 66. In contrast, Theresa May is dealing with her terrorism while the election campaign is still going on. For the prime minister, there are several lessons she could take from the experience of her Labour predecessor. Anti-terror laws made up on the hoof in the heat of the moment are not always the best ones. And laws do not always help. Since 2000, there has also been a lot of counter-terrorism legislation passed by Parliament and yet the threat is still there and very real. Yet Mrs May clearly felt the need to say something in Downing Street in response to the London Bridge attack that went beyond the usual condemnation of the violence, sympathy for the victims and their families and praise for the security forces. The fact that she announced some policy prescriptions showed that, in her mind, the need to be seen to being doing something outweighed the inevitable criticism of politicising the reaction to the incident. And, of course, a four-point plan was better than Mr Blair's 12. This was a recognition by the prime minister that security is now a significant issue in this election. Long after the rows of this campaign are over the government that is elected will still be facing the threat of Islamist terrorism. Where once the last few days of the election might have been focused on Brexit or tax or spending, much time and space will now be devoted to police numbers, intelligence capacity and extremist ideology. It is a political truism that security issues tend to favour the incumbent, allowing the prime minister of the day to look and be prime ministerial. It lifts them temporarily from the petty partisan point-scoring to the Olympian heights of statesmanship and all that a Downing Street podium can confer upon them. In times of uncertainty, the status quo looks attractive. As Belloc rhymed, \"Always keep a-hold of nurse for fear of finding something worse\". Yet for Mrs May this is a double-edged sword. Her security background gives her the experience and knowledge to sound convincing and credible on counter-terrorism. Yet it also gives her opponents a record to attack and ask what on earth she has been doing as home secretary over the past seven years to tackle the threat. Has she, for example, been increasing or cutting police budgets? Security is also double-edged for Jeremy Corbyn. These attacks have allowed his opponents to revive past comments revealing his reluctance to use armed force, to accuse him of consorting with members of the IRA, and to remind voters of his opposition to many counter-terrorism laws. But the issue also allows the Labour leader to surprise voters with a counterintuitive promise to give the police full authority to use force. It also gives him space to question some of Britain's alliances with countries in the Middle East from where some Islamist ideology originated. The truth is that the impact of such incidents on elections is not straightforward. In Israel, for instance, what are considered to be terror attacks tend to favour parties of the right over parties of the left. But the evidence elsewhere appears inconsistent and sketchy. The terror attack in Paris this April did not help the Front National leader, Marine Le Pen. But in Spain in 2004, the attack on Madrid's commuter trains that killed 192 people - just three days before polling - did not help save the ruling centre-right Popular Party from defeat. The bottom line, perhaps, is that many voters in Britain will have seen terrorism before. And they will see it as just one issue among many on which they can base their vote. They also know that elections are about choosing a government for potentially five years and knee-jerk decisions are not always best for the long-term.",

In contrast, Prime Minister Theresa May has announced a four-point plan in response to the London Bridge attack, which has also received criticism but may be seen as a necessary response to the threat of terrorism. The issue of security is likely to play a significant role in the ongoing election campaign, with both May and opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn facing scrutiny over their records and policies on counter-terrorism. The impact of terror attacks on elections is not straightforward, and voters are likely to consider a range of factors when making their decisions.",

        "article": "Bobby Jindal is warning that the Republicans must stop being the \"stupid party\". The Louisiana governor, a likely contender for his party's presidential nomination in 2016, said a number of Republicans had \"damaged the brand\" by making \"offensive and bizarre\" comments. He's talking of course about those remarks about \"legitimate rape\" and how rape can't lead to pregnancy. The Republicans who made those comments did seem to be going out of their way to back up John Stuart Mill's 1866 comment: \"I never meant to say that the Conservatives are generally stupid. I meant to say that stupid people are generally Conservative. I believe that is so obviously and universally admitted a principle that I hardly think any gentleman will deny it.\" OK. That's the headline grabber. But it is hardly a revelation to point out that those who make weird noises during an election campaign should shut up. So it is worth looking at Gov Jindal's prescription in full. It is, after all, among the first contributions from a big name of the Republican party on how not to go down to defeat for a third time in a row. He's adamant the party shouldn't change its principles. Not on taxation or big government, of course. But not on abortion or gay marriage either. He rejects Mr Romney's apparent contention that 47% of voters were out of reach for Republicans, which was always, when you think about it, a counsel of despair. Gov Jindal identifies a core Republican problem: they are overwhelmingly white in a country that is becoming more of a melting pot day by day. \"We must reject the notion that demography is destiny, the pathetic and simplistic notion that skin pigmentation dictates voter behaviour,\" he said. He's a good person to say this. His parents came to the US from India in 1970. It says a lot about the way America has changed that he has become the governor of a state that resisted civil rights and defended segregation to the bitter end. I don't want to underplay how important that is - but his speech doesn't say how Republicans can reach the fastest growing ethnic group - Latinos - without shifting their stance on immigration reform. Moreover, I am puzzled by what appears to be the core of his message. He rejects big government - but also seems to reject the fights about it in Washington. He calls not only the debates about gun control, but also those on the fiscal cliff and debt ceiling \"sideshows\". \"These are in reality sideshows in Washington that we have allowed to take centre stage in our country - and as conservatives, we are falling into the sideshow trap,\" he said. This is not an isolated point. \"We seem to have an obsession with government bookkeeping,\" he says. \"We as Republicans have to accept that government number crunching - even conservative number crunching - is not the answer to our nation's problems.\" Of course he's underscoring an inherent irony in conservatism - those politicians who dislike government put all their time and effort and will and money into becoming part of the government, so they can do away with much of it. Inevitably, they rather like being part of it, and stick around for years trying to slim down something they disapprove of, fanatical dieters insisting on eating at the best restaurants so they can better control the portion sizes. It is an irony, in that one can chuckle about it, but it is not a paradox. It is, I would have thought, pretty essential for conservatives who want to control government spending to have control of that government. His argument seems to be that Republicans should spend their time encouraging the \"real economy\" and leaving it up to the states to spend what little public money he deems necessary. Maybe this is merely a coded attack on those Republicans in the House of Representatives, who seem to think they won the election. If he is identifying them as a major part of the party's image problem, he is right, but he's not pointing a way out of their complex dilemma - the choice between being quislings to faithful Republicans or obstructionists in the mind of most Americans. So an \"A\" for effort, grabbing headlines, and identifying the obvious, but a \"C\" for a rather confused economic approach, which looks more like a desire to say something jolting than a serious contribution. I'm looking forward to hearing Florida Senator Marco Rubio, and, even more, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, describe the way ahead. But Gov Jindal has made a start confronting his shocked, and rather complacent, party.",

        "article": "Cheating in exams is fairly common in the Indian state of Bihar, but new images have emerged which show just how large-scale and blatant the practice is. Many students smuggled in textbooks and notes into the examination centres despite tight security - and parents and friends were photographed scaling the walls of test centres to pass on answers to students during the current secondary school examinations. The examinations, held by the Bihar School Examination Board (BSEB), began on Tuesday and are scheduled to go on until 24 March. Officials say more than 1.4 million students are taking the tests. Most of the incidents of cheating this year have been reported from Saharsa, Chhapra, Vaishali and Hajipur districts. Local newspapers have been full of photos of parents and relatives trying to help their children cheat even at considerable risk to their own lives, BBC Hindi's Manish Saandilya reports from the state capital, Patna. Some photos even show policemen posted outside the centres accepting bribes to look the other way, our correspondent adds. Photojournalist Dipankar, who took the photos in Saharsa district, says when he went into the examination hall and began taking pictures, the students did not seem worried at all. Despite the many reports that have appeared in the local newspapers, the authorities seem uninterested in taking any action against the students, he says. Dipankar says during a raid at just one school on Wednesday, the authorities seized sheets containing answers which filled up nine sacks. Nearly 20 parents were detained briefly for trying to help their children cheat, but they were let go after a warning, he adds. At some schools, like this one in Saran in Chhapra district, parents also clashed with the police. Those caught cheating can be barred from taking an examination for up to three years, they can also be jailed or ordered to pay a fine, but punishment in such cases has rarely been reported in Bihar. Education officials say they are committed to holding free, fair and peaceful examinations, and that examination centres are being filmed and special \"flying squads\" of officials are making surprise visits to the centres. They say at least 400 students who have been caught cheating have been expelled. But they say the government alone cannot stop cheating without help from students and parents. \"What can the government do to stop cheating if parents and relatives are not ready to cooperate? Should the government give orders to shoot them?\" the Times of India quoted Bihar Education Minister PK Shahi as saying.",

Corey Lewandowski had been charged with simple battery after reporter Michelle Fields said he forcibly grabbed her arm on 8 March. State prosecutors determined there was not enough evidence to convict him. Mr Lewandowski, supported by Mr Trump, accused Ms Fields of exaggerating the event and changing her story. \"Our perception is reality, her perception is that she was almost thrown to the ground,\" said Brad Cohen, Mr Lewandowski's lawyer. Police in Florida had charged Mr Lewandowski after Ms Fields filed a criminal complaint. \"Although there was probable cause to make an arrest, the evidence cannot prove all legally required elements of the crime alleged and is insufficient to support a criminal prosecution,\" prosecutor Dave Aronberg said. The announcement comes days before the New York state primary, which will be crucial to Mr Trump's campaign for the Republican presidential nomination. Mr Trump currently leads the race. Investigators did concede that Mr Lewandowski \"pulled Ms Fields back\" when she tried to interview Mr Trump, but said he could have thought she was \"making unwanted physical contact\" with him. \"While the facts support the allegation that Mr. Lewandowski did grab Ms Fields' arm against her will, Mr Lewandowski has a reasonable hypothesis of innocence,\" Mr Aronberg said The Trump campaign said in a statement that Mr Lewandowski is \"gratified\" by the prosecutor's decision. He \"appreciates the thoughtful consideration and professionalism by the Palm Beach State Attorney and his staff who carefully reviewed this matter, as well as Mr. Trump's loyalty and the support of his colleagues and family during this time, the statement reads. \"The matter is now concluded.\" Ms Fields tweeted that the office of the prosecutor asked her if she would accept an apology from Mr Lewandowski, to which she said yes, but that she has not heard back about it. Ms Fields quit her job at conservative news site Breitbart following the event, saying that they did not defend her in the aftermath of the event.

The 19-year-old Sunderland Ladies striker has scored 66 goals is 68 appearances in two-and-a-half seasons, including 13 in 17 in this season's FA Women's Super League 2. Logically, Mead's next step is the top flight, and she could get there with the Black Cats, who need just five points to seal promotion this term. \"I've spoken to some of the (FAWSL 1) managers but they know at the moment I'm doing well at Sunderland,\" she told BBC Newcastle. \"Maybe at the end of the season I might get a few calls, but we will see where Sunderland end up. \"You can tell the difference between us and the teams in the top league. They are training every day, with the likes of Jordan (Nobbs), Jill (Scott) and Steph Houghton going full-time, and it has helped them develop their careers a lot. \"I would like to be in that position as well.\" Mead showcased her talents at the recent U20 World Cup in Canada, scoring a wonder goal that upped her profile and was widely shared on social media. \"I didn't realise it would be as big as it was, but I'm glad about what it did for women's football and how it helped promote the game more,\" she explained. \"It was mental, the response I got from the goal. \"It just felt right when I went to hit it, and obviously I hit it well and it went in the top corner.\" With England honours at U15, U17, U19 and U20 level, Mead is now waiting for a senior call-up from national boss Mark Sampson. \"Mark has shown that if you're on form he will pick you in any league - Fran Kirby (Reading striker) has just got in and she is in FAWSL 2. She's on fire at the moment,\" said Mead. \"If he thinks you've got the talent and he thinks you can do a job in his team he'll pick you at any age.\" Like Rachel Yankey, Jordan Nobbs and Steph Houghton, the Whitby-born forward started her football career when her mother took her to a boys' Saturday morning training session. Aged 10, Mead went on to join the California Girls side, but continued to play along with the boys as well, and eventually came to the attention of the Middlesbrough Centre of Excellence. \"I started out with a boys' team, and played for them until I wasn't allowed to anymore. Playing with the boys helped me develop a lot quicker. \"I was scared of the girls more than the boys when it came down to it.\" Mead made her way through the age groups at Middlesbrough, and in 2010 she showed up on England's radar, earning England caps at both U15 and U17 level. \"It was a bit surreal - at that age I'd never thought I would be playing at an international standard,\" she said. \"I'd started playing well for the Centre of Excellence and obviously England scouts came to watch some games and I impressed them. \"I went to a one-day camp and did really well, I scored four goals in one game, so from there it just took off.\" In 2011, FA Women's Premier League champions Sunderland soon came calling, and Mead was thrust straight into the starting line-up, notching 23 goals in as many games, finishing as top scorer in the Premier League and helping secure Sunderland the league and cup double. She followed her debut season with an even better second campaign, netting 30 times in 28 appearances on the way to another golden boot and league title. Further international recognition followed, with a call-up for the European Under-19 Championships. \"I think that was the making of my England career,\" concluded Mead. \"In qualifying we got beaten in the first game by Serbia, but from then until the final we hadn't been beaten or conceded a goal, so I think that was just a great thing for the team.\"",

        "article": "A major review of inquests into some of the most controversial killings during the Troubles got under way on Monday. There are 56 cases involving 97 deaths. They include killings by police officers and soldiers, and others where there are allegations of state collusion. As the review got under way in Belfast, the time taken by police to security-vet and disclose classified case files was repeatedly highlighted as an obstacle in the way of progress. Twenty-two of the cases are more than 40 years old. Lord Justice Weir, the presiding judge of the Coroners' Service, is spending the next two weeks conducting preliminary hearings to assess the state of readiness of each case. Families of those who were killed and their legal teams have been asked to inform the court of the issues which are outstanding in each of the cases. The stalled inquests into the Army shootings of 10 people in Ballymurphy, west Belfast, in 1971, and of five more civilians in nearby Springhill a year later, were examined on the opening day in Laganside Courts. The cases focusing on nine deaths linked to the Royal Ulster Constabulary's (RUC) alleged \"shoot to kill\" policy in the 1980s were also assessed. A barrister for families of two INLA members shot dead by the RUC in 1982 - Seamus Grew and Roddy Carroll - criticised police after they said disclosure could not be completed ahead of a proposed September 2017 inquest date. A Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) representative told the court at least another year would be required. The barrister for the Grew and Carroll families accused the police of failing to honour a series of similar disclosure commitments since the cases were re-opened in 2007. \"Obviously there is the suspicion within the families that the PSNI have been dragging their heels over disclosure in order to protect the RUC,\" he said. \"They are fighting a rearguard action on behalf of the RUC, which they have done successfully to date.\" Ahead of the review, a senior police officer said the disclosure delays were due to the huge pressures being placed upon the PSNI's Legacy Support Unit (LSU). Dep Ch Const Drew Harris said attempting to run the 56 inquests at the same time, rather than sequencing them in order, resulted in the LSU continually jumping from one case to the other. When the review is completed, a coroner will be appointed to hear inquests identified as ready to proceed. In the others, relevant parties will be instructed to provide any outstanding material needed for an inquest to take place. Some of the hearings are expected to take place later this year. The most complex and controversial ones are likely to be heard by a High Court judge, while others will be heard by a County Court judge. Justice Minister David Ford last year authorised the Northern Ireland Courts and Tribunals Service to recruit \"investigative support\" for coroners dealing with the legacy inquests. The review was announced by Lord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan in October, a month before he was appointed president of the Coroners' Courts. Sir Declan said he wanted to assure the families of those who were killed that he was \"fully committed to doing all that I can, within my sphere of influence and with the resources at my disposal, to ensure that justice is delivered\". But he also warned that it could be \"many years\" before most of the cases could be dealt with. Only nine legacy cases have been disposed of during the past five years, and 13 cases in total in the past 10 years. In November 2014, Sir Declan warned that inquests into deaths involving alleged state collusion and cover-up could go on until 2040 unless the coronial inquests system was changed.",

Barts Health NHS Trust was placed in special measures in March, but has faced further inspections by the Care Quality Commission. It said \"too little attention\" was paid to safety and pointed out leadership failings at the organisation. The trust said it was \"very sorry\" and that it was facing a \"big challenge\". Barts Health NHS Trust is responsible for the care of around 2.5 million people. It was placed into special measures when a culture of bullying and low morale was discovered among staff at one of the hospitals it runs, Whipps Cross in Leytonstone, east London. Fresh concerns have now been raised at the Royal London Hospital and Newham University Hospital. The CQC said patient safety was not given sufficient priority, staff were discouraged from raising their concerns amid a culture of blame. It added that staffing was significantly below recommended levels and the hospitals were so full that patients were not always cared for on appropriate wards. Some faced delays of more than 18 weeks from referral to treatment and some patients had their surgery cancelled on several occasions due to a lack of beds. Prof Sir Mike Richards, the chief inspector of hospitals, said: \"It is clear that the leadership issues we found at Whipps Cross were replicated at the other hospitals. \"There is still a lack of engagement with the staff, low morale, high levels of stress, even confusion among the workforce about who is in charge. \"Across the trust there is too little attention paid to safety, with failures in incident reporting and auditing, and in dealing with or learning from complaints. \"If the trust is to turn round then it must focus first on the culture and on the leadership issues so that it can effectively deal with all the individual concerns which we have identified on this inspection.\" The CQC has identified 65 areas where the trust must make improvements. Steve Ryan, the chief medical officer at Barts Health NHS Trust, said: \"We are very sorry for the failings identified by the CQC in some of our services at Newham and the Royal London hospitals. \"We know we have a big challenge ahead but we are determined to rise to that challenge. \"We are already making rapid and dramatic improvements in key areas.

        "article": "Standing hand-in-hand like theatre actors at their curtain call, Wales' players were met with a spine-tingling rendition of the national anthem from their fans following their European Championship semi-final defeat by Portugal. This was the end of the road for Wales in France but the 'Red Wall' - as Wales' players have dubbed their supporters - was still roaring its encouragement at full volume. Wales' momentous campaign was halted by a clinical Portugal side but, watching their team play their first semi-final at a major tournament, this was no occasion for fans to feel deflated. This was a moment of mutual adoration between a team who have established themselves as Wales' greatest, and their unwavering supporters. The bond between Wales' players and fans has been one of the defining features of Euro 2016, a symbiotic relationship that has propelled the country's football to new heights. As well as the anthem, 'Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau', and a repertoire of hymns, the Welsh chant of choice during this tournament has been 'Don't Take Me Home'. There was a poignancy to its airing in Lyon, for it has been a dreamlike existence for Wales fans in France. With their team absent from major tournaments for 58 years, generations in Wales have grown up to expect failure and look on longingly as others contest World Cups and European Championships. But Chris Coleman's men have changed that. The beaming smiles on Welsh fans' faces before their opening match in Bordeaux spoke of a disbelief at seeing their team finally claiming their place among international football's elite. \"There was a psychological barrier we needed to go through for the first one, given it had been so long,\" said Coleman. \"We've now sampled tournament football - such an experience, such a healthy vibe from people of all nations. We want some more of that. We need some more of that.\" Wales' players would have been forgiven for feeling as if they were living in a bubble at their training base in the idyllic Brittany coastal town of Dinard, where a small population and a gentle pace of life meant they could take a stroll on the beach and go unnoticed. It is a far cry from the frenzy their success has caused back home. With every victory in France, a new fan zone seemed to spring up in Wales, from Rhyl to Aberystwyth, from Swansea to Cardiff's Principality Stadium. He saw us grow up. He's always in the back of our minds. When we achieve something, we think about him The messages of support were many and varied, from David Hasselhoff to the Prince of Wales, while songs by Welsh bands the Manic Street Preachers and the Super Furry Animals gave the campaign a unique soundtrack. Despite their serene and remote surroundings, however, the players were aware of the impression they were making. In the age of social media, athletes and their followers are closer than ever, and Wales' squad members have relished that connection. Hal Robson-Kanu's spectacular goal against Belgium made the unattached forward one of the unlikeliest stars of Euro 2016 and, speaking a couple of days later, he laughed when told about the global reaction to his goal - including a tweet from the former Nigeria and Arsenal striker Kanu. There was a similar response from Joe Allen, who laughed when this reporter informed him of a fans' banner that read: \"When God made Joe Allen, he was showing off.\" From a journalist's perspective, covering this Wales side has been a privilege, given regular and revealing access to the coaches and players. Gareth Bale, the world's most expensive footballer, was a picture of charm and affability as he conducted his media conferences and subsequent interviews before every match. The Real Madrid forward was as comfortable talking about the Wales squad's quiz nights and their occasional treats of burgers and chips as he was about the actual football. For all the lustre the likes of Bale and Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey add to this Wales side, it is the unbreakable team spirit that has been the foundation of their success. The vast majority of the squad have played youth football together, grown up together and become close friends. Even when Bale is injured, he will join up with the squad in order to see those he misses while on club duty in Spain - Joe Ledley and Wayne Hennessey are among those he gets on with best. These genuine friendships have bound the team together, as has a tragedy that cast a shadow over football. The death of Coleman's predecessor Gary Speed in 2011 shocked the entire sport, with the grief particularly profound for his young Wales players, many of whom are in the current side. Captain Ashley Williams was clearly moved as he spoke about Speed on the eve of the match against Portugal. \"My thought coming in was I hope he'd be proud of us. He saw us grow up, and what we've achieved today,\" he said. \"He's always in the back of our minds. When we achieve something, we think about him.\" Speed was on the supporters' minds as well, with cries of \"There's only one Speedo\" heard at every game. A friend of Speed's since childhood, Coleman says he thinks about his former team-mate every day, whether there is a fixture or not. Succeeding his friend as Wales manager was a wrench for Coleman but there can be no doubt he and his players have done Speed proud. Coleman said before the match against Portugal that this run to the semi-finals would not represent the end of his team's journey. Absent from major tournaments for 58 years before Euro 2016, Wales are unwilling to endure another long wait. The current crop of players is ripe for an era of regular qualifying, with Ashley Williams and James Collins the only players over 30 to start the match against Portugal. An average age of just over 27 means Wales' squad was the seventh youngest of the 24 teams at Euro 2016, and Coleman believes this tournament could be a springboard for further success. \"The one thing that will stop us from doing it again is ourselves,\" he said. \"We're good enough. We have to have the same hunger and desire, and we'll give the World Cup campaign a hell of a crack.\" Wales will be back in action in September when they host Moldova in their opening qualifier for the 2018 World Cup. Planning for that campaign can wait for now, though. With a homecoming parade taking place in Cardiff on Friday, Wales will take this opportunity to reflect on and revel in the magnitude of their achievement. Just as they were at the final whistle in Lyon, Wales' players will be greeted by the great 'Red Wall' in Cardiff. Returning home will feel like the end of the journey but, where Coleman and his players are concerned, this is not the final act.",

        "article": "Polls suggest Hungary's governing Fidesz party is set to win another two-thirds majority at Sunday's general election. Opposition leader Gordon Bajnai never once raises his voice, despite the roar of the crowd behind him. In the face of the opinion polls, he insists: \"We are flying blind in these elections. Opinion polls were invented for normal democracies. If democracy becomes limited, then surveys are of limited value too.\" As leader of Together 2014, a centrist opposition movement, he is running in these elections as part of an uneasy coalition of leftist, liberal and green parties, trying to oust the popular and populist Prime Minister, Viktor Orban. His last hope is that the many people fed up with Mr Orban will find just enough in the opposition programme to vote for. Mr Bajnai's vision of Mr Orban's Hungary is a dark one of a country Ferenc Kumin looks out from his first-floor window in the south wing of the Hungarian parliament onto a very different Hungary. As spokesman of the Fidesz government, he is inordinately proud of the vast, newly landscaped square, of the new metro line under the city (begun by the liberals, completed by Fidesz) but above all by his government's record in office. \"Hungary is performing better!\" is the message plastered on the country's buses, trams and roadside billboards for the past months - long before the election campaign started. Mr Kumin has the figures to prove it: Viktor Orban has decided not to publish a party programme for this election, preferring the simpler message: \"We cut utility bills\". A swingeing 30% cut in gas bills has proven rather popular with consumers. The opposition says Hungary's 27% value added tax - the highest in Europe - harms their standard of living far more. Mr Kumin rebuts Gordon Bajnai's allegations one by one. Democracy is alive and well in Hungary, he insists. The main criticisms by European institutions of the media law and the new constitution were addressed with amendments. All parties agreed that Hungary needed a smaller, more streamlined parliament, and that is what has been achieved - without gerrymandering, he says. The cuts in utility bills, he says, are part of the Fidesz philosophy to stand up for households against big businesses which overcharge consumers. And the big loan from Russia to build new nuclear reactors, he believes, will make it possible to keep electricity prices down. Budapest does look beautiful in the spring sunshine. Tourists flock here in ever greater numbers. Cruise liners plough the River Danube. The newly paved area around the parliament building lacks trees but is otherwise impeccable. An army of street sweepers swoops on each chocolate wrapper before it hits the ground. Japanese tourists flock enthusiastically to watch the raising of the Hungarian flag each morning and its lowering at dusk. The new metro station at Kalvin Square is a science-fiction extravaganza. Gellert Square, a marvel of mosaics. At least 150,000 (pro-government media said 500,000) government supporters turned out for the final Fidesz rally in Heroes Square to hear Viktor Orban exhort the faithful. This is nothing less than a love affair with a charismatic leader for whom the centrist opposition has no answer. Only the radical nationalist Jobbik party outdoes Viktor Orban with its promise to defend Hungary from interference from Brussels. Jobbik shares Viktor Orban's conversion to nuclear energy, but combines it with a pro-Russian rhetoric not heard in Hungary since the early 1950s. According to Jobbik MP Marton Gyongyosi, the recent referendum in Crimea on leaving Ukraine was a model of self-determination. But he firmly denies allegations that his party is partly financed by Russian state or private sources. While Jobbik hopes to swell its 16.7% score four years ago to over 20% this time, Hungary's main Green Party, LMP, which stands for Politics Can Be Different, is struggling to cross the 5% threshold needed to remain in parliament. The increasingly crude mud-slinging between Fidesz and the centrist bloc in the last days of the campaign could boost votes for both Jobbik and the LMP.",

Their last home game, a 4-0 win over Droylsden, attracted 142 supporters and after staff and players were paid, the Tigers were left with \u00a321 profit. Last week, the club issued an appeal for \u00a325,000 so they could \"stay in a solvent position\" until the summer. \"There are fans out there but if they don't come back then we're not going to have a team,\" said Hughes. The club's owner, Eamonn McGurk, has supported the club financially since they struggled to pay a tax bill of more than \u00a380,000 in the 1990s. It is estimated his investment runs to more than \u00a31m, in addition to funding the planning costs for a new ground. The Blue Square Bet North club have been without a home for six years after their Meadow Park ground was destroyed by flooding and their nomadic status has played a major part in their financial difficulties. They have shared with local clubs Forest Green Rovers, Cirencester and most recently Cheltenham Town - where they have been based since 2010. But Hughes believes their move out of the city, and the historical rivalry the Tigers have with Cheltenham, has caused fans to abandon their local club. \"If I had \u00a310 for every time I've spoken to someone who has said 'I used to support Gloucester but I'm not going to come back until you've returned to Gloucester', I'd probably be able to sustain the club,\" he told BBC Gloucestershire. \"There's always been this rivalry across the divide but Cheltenham are a Football League club now and that's what we've always wanted to aspire to. \"We've been fortunate that Cheltenham allowed us to have a ground share - they could have said no.\" Gloucester pay \u00a340,000 a year to play at Whaddon Road, but were recently threatened with eviction after failing to meet payments. The issue is close to being resolved and Gloucester hope to have a deal in place next week to remain in Cheltenham for next season's campaign. Plans for a new stadium at the Meadow Park site were submitted to Gloucester City Council in 2011, but have yet to be approved. \"It has left me so frustrated,\" Hughes added. \"There's been a lot of money spent on reports etc [for new stadium] and it's been draining. \"It's been difficult. We're tired and we just need something we can hang our hat on. We need something that will attract investors and keep us going.\"",

        "article": "Former first minister Alex Salmond has suggested a second referendum on Scottish independence could be held in two years time. In a column in the National newspaper, he said he has \"little doubt\" the \"next test is coming\". He said that his \"guess\" on timing is that \"it is likely to be the autumn of 2018\". Opposition parties pointed out that the SNP previously said the independence referendum was \"once in a generation\". Mr Salmond resigned as SNP leader after losing the 2014 referendum, which was held two years ago on Sunday. Writing in the National, he said: \"If I have to guess a date then I'd say that it is likely to be the autumn of 2018. And even on that two-year timescale there is much to be done. \"In the first vote, what began as a Scottish government initiative transformed into a popular campaign. We should never forget that inspiration. \"However, indyref2 can't just be the same. As Leicester seem to be finding out in the Premier League, much to the regret of this romantic football fan. \"You can't roll out the same tactics and trust them to be as effective as before.\" Mr Salmond made similar comments during an interview with Russia Today. Independence supporters are holding a rally in Glasgow's George Square to campaign for a second referendum. A second rally is due to be held on Sunday. Mr Salmond's successor, Nicola Sturgeon, has said a referendum re-run is \"highly likely\" following the UK's vote to leave the EU. However, the first minister is also exploring \"options\" to maintain Scotland's links with the EU, as part of the UK's Brexit negotiations. Writing in The Times, Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale said \"there should be a renewed focus on the day job from the SNP\". \"Two years on, the divisions caused by that historic contest have not healed,\" she said. \"On social media and in the real word, the scars that are Alex Salmond's political legacy remain painfully obvious. \"Mr Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon promised voters that the result would stand for a 'generation'. \"I believe that when politicians promise something, the voters have a right to expect them to honour that. \"Yet here we are again, two years later, and Nicola Sturgeon is agitating for another referendum.\" The Scottish Conservatives have been holding street stalls across Scotland to campaign against a second independence referendum. Leader Ruth Davidson said: \"Scottish Conservatives are out in towns and cities across Scotland today to stand with all those who don't want our country dragged back to a second referendum. \"Two years ago, we settled this issue - we decided to remain within the United Kingdom. This anniversary should be the moment when we move on, and we will stand with all those people across the country who want to do just that. \"We call on the SNP today to respect the decision we made. \"There is no justification to drag us back to an argument that belongs in the past.

        "article": "Over the last couple of weeks, the world has woken up to the horrific trade in human beings being conducted in the seas of South East Asia. We've learned a lot about the end of the journey, the slave camps and mass graves in the jungles of Thailand and Malaysia. What we haven't heard so much about is how these journeys begin. We travelled to southern Bangladesh, where many of the migrants set off on their perilous voyages. What we have discovered brings a shocking new dimension to this story that speaks of the terrible desperation that is driving this vast movement of people. We met one of the people smugglers on what Bangladeshis proudly boast is the world's longest beach - a vast stretch of sand that runs for more than 120km along the southern coast. Let's call him Kamrul Rahman. He appeared to be in his early 30s.  He said he used to be a fisherman and started in the people smuggling racket greedy for money after his business went belly up. As the surf crashed down on the beach beside us, he calmly explained in chilling detail how the business worked. He said the prison camps were an essential part of the business model and all the migrants knew about them. It seems they are part of what amounts to a sinister and hideously cynical marketing trick the people smugglers have evolved: they offer the voyage for virtually no upfront cost. He said the deal was straightforward and understood by everyone involved. You only pay the main charge - about \u00c2\u00a31,500 ($2,300) when you arrive in southern Thailand. I was amazed. \"So the migrants know they will be held in camp before they get to Malaysia?\" I asked. \"Before they leave from here we tell them if they don't pay they will be put in a prison. You won't get any rice and you will die of hunger\", he told me, without any sign of emotion. \"If you pay, you will be able to start for Malaysia with honour.\" We spoke to many migrants and relatives of migrants in southern Bangladesh. They all confirmed his account. Without exception, they said they knew migrants would be held in Thailand until full payment was made. What this suggests is that for the most part this phenomenon isn't strictly human trafficking - where people are bought and sold against their will - but rather a perverted business transaction to which most of the migrants and their families are actually party. The so-called \"ransoms\" migrants who have been rescued from the camps in Thailand say their captors are actually part of the deal they sign up to when they make the journey. Take a moment now to think about what that tells us about the people who make these journeys. They are so desperate for a better life that they are willing to go with the people smugglers even though they know that they may end up starving to death in a jungle prison camp. Stina Ljungdell, the UN refugee agency representative in Bangladesh, agrees that many migrants do know what they are getting into. If you think about it objectively, it makes a kind of sick business sense for both the smugglers and their customers. The migrants are assured that they only pay the full cost if they actually arrive in Thailand - cash on delivery, if you like. Meanwhile, the smugglers have leverage to guarantee that they get paid. The model has the added advantage, from the perspective of the smugglers at least, of making the decision to attempt the trip much easier. It seems many young men, and it is predominantly young men who seem to make the journey, are lured in the risky and selfish hope that their family will find a way raise the money once they arrive in Thailand. But other migrants make the decision to leave together with their families, judging that it is the only way to lift them out of poverty. We were told that a successful migrant can send as much as 30,000 taka (\u00c2\u00a3260/$400) back to his family each month. But many, many migrants don't make it. Within minutes of arriving in an unofficial camp for Rohingya refugees further up the coast, I was surrounded by parents showing me pictures of their missing sons (and occasionally daughters). Some said their sons had left for Malaysia without telling them. Many others, however, said they had sent them off in the hope that they would send money back for the family. According to the smuggler, one in five of the migrants he takes don't make it to Malaysia. Many die before they even reach the camps, he told me. \"Some die because of the suffering, some die because of of tension, some die thinking about how to escape from the situation and some people die of hunger after they run out of food. \"All people have to die\", he said, \"that is fate.\"",
        "target": "The recent discovery of mass graves and slave camps in Thailand and Malaysia has shed light on the grim reality of the human trafficking industry. People smugglers in Bangladesh have been found to be using a twisted business model, offering migrants a 'cash on delivery' deal, where they only pay the full cost of their journey once they arrive in Thailand. Many migrants are aware of the risks and the possibility of being held in prison camps, but they are so desperate for a better life that they are willing to take the chance. This highlights the extreme desperation and poverty that is driving the migration of people from Bangladesh and other countries in the region.",

The announcement follows a series of drone crashes that made the company recall its much anticipated Karma aircraft. In addition, the US company said its president, Anthony Bates, would quit his post at the end of the year after three years in the job. GoPro said that consumer demand for its products remained \"solid\". However, the company has posted a loss in each of its past four quarters. At the start of this month it also revealed its cash reserves had fallen to  $132m (\u00c2\u00a3106m) - less than half the amount at the start of the year. \"I knew they were in trouble, but I didn't expect them to have such a dramatic fall from grace,\" Tom Morrod, director of consumer electronics at the IHS consultancy, told the BBC. \"The Karma drones were their recover strategy, and when they had to be recalled it faltered. This is the result. \"GoPro was struggling as an action cam specialist, which is why it needed an alternative market. The fact that the device was unsalable has damaged its prospects, at least temporarily.\" The job cuts represent 15% of the California-based company's workforce. The move reflects the fact that even if the fold-up Karma drone returns to sale, GoPro will probably have missed out on the Christmas shopping season. It had sold about 2,500 of the drones in the 16 days they were on the market. A problem with the machines caused a number of them to lose power mid-flight, causing them to fall uncontrolled out of the air. One video of an accident showed the drone diving on to a beach on which people were walking. There have been no reports of injuries. However, the company is being sued over claims it misled investors about demand for the product and took too long to alert the public to its power supply flaw. Reviews for GoPro's new Hero 5 cameras have generally been positive. The new devices introduced voice control, electronic image stabilisation and built-in water resistance. However, some technology blogs doubted whether the features were enough to convince existing owners to upgrade. And the company faces increased competition from rival action cams and the improved quality of smartphone cameras, many of which now also offer protection against water. As part of its cutbacks GoPro is also closing its entertainment division. The operation was announced in July 2015 and offered owners thousands of dollars for videos they had filmed using its equipment. In return it wanted the right to promote their content through its social media accounts. It also sought to sell the rights to the material to advertising agencies and split the proceeds. The company described it as a \"no-brainer\" for creative professionals at the time. GoPro's shares were trading 2.5% up on the day by early afternoon in New York, but they remain down on their value at the start of the year.",

Jak Trueman, 15, was suffering from a rare form of blood cancer called gamma delta T-cell lymphoma. On Saturday he briefly attended a school prom held in his honour. His mother Allison broke the news of his death on his Facebook page, saying: \"Devastated and heartbroken to say my beautiful boy's gone to Heaven.\" She added: \"God bless. Jak I am the proudest Mummy ever xxxxx Simply the best xxx.\" The West Calder High School pupil had been documenting his life and treatment on social media. Since he was diagnosed with cancer last August, Jak had been posting updates on a Facebook page called Jak's Journey with the help of his mother, sister Aimie and girlfriend Hannah Boyd. The teenager's story of his fight against cancer, and his relentlessly positive attitude, touched the hearts of many people in West Lothian and beyond. The Jak's Journey page attracted more than 28,000 Likes and documented the teenage goalkeeper's love of Rangers FC, and his meetings with former Ibrox stars Neil Alexander and Nacho Novo and current goalkeeper Cammy Bell. On Saturday, he managed to make it along to his prom for 10 minutes but had to leave as he felt unwell. Jak was greeted at the event by former Rangers captain Barry Ferguson. The teenager wrote on his page: \"I would just like to make a massive apology for me only turning up and then having to go again. \"I was gutted and really sad as I never spoke to anyone, but I took really unwell really quickly as I had been lying in bed for three days without hardly moving. \"Thank you to everyone who organised it and came along. Even just knowing it was all happening for me makes me smile.\" At the party, Jak's family collected the teenager's Bronze Duke of Edinburgh Award and also the Kerry MacGregor Memorial Trophy for overcoming adversity. The Jak's Journey website highlighted Jak's stay at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh and Yorkhill Hospital in Glasgow over the past few months. He was visited by players from Celtic, Hibs, Hearts and Edinburgh Rugby and the cast of the musical Wicked. Jak and his family also published many other personal moments, including him playing his tuba and visiting his classmates and teachers at school. On 23 January, Jak and his family found out from doctors that his cancer had spread throughout his body. The medics made a decision to not pursue any other treatment. At the time, Jak wrote: \"This is the saddest day of our lives yet but I am going to fight the pain and get as many days/weeks/months/years I can get. They can't give me a timescale to how long I have. \"I am so sorry to give everyone this horrible news but there's no other way to put it. \"I would like to thank all the doctors, nurses and everyone who has helped me over the past six months, they have tried their best for me.\" In the days after he received the news, Jak's family urged people to donate to a fundraising page for Leukaemia & Lymphoma Research. After becoming ill Jak also visited the Kelpies, enjoyed a romantic meal with his girlfriend, went to a party in his honour which was attended by Neil Alexander and Nacho Novo, and spent time in a supercar and on a quad bike. More money is expected to be raised for charity on Sunday at a special football match being held at the Energy Assets Arena, home of Livingston FC.",

A series of groups spoke out after Europe's top court ruled a Romanian man whose employer read his messages had not had his rights violated. He broke company policy by using a work account to talk to his family. In response, bodies representing directors and workers, as well as privacy and human resources groups, all issued similar warnings to bosses. The European Trades Union Congress, which represents workers across the continent, said the judges' decision should not act as a \"green light\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 to start snooping\" on staff. The case in the European Court of Human Rights did not introduce any new rules, but acted as a stress test for those that already allowed similar surveillance by employers in some circumstances. Institute of Directors director general Simon Walker said: \"Employees should not be subject to Stasi-style surveillance at work. \"We would strongly urge businesses not to read an employee's personal messages, apart from in the most exceptional circumstances.\" British Trades Union Congress general secretary Frances O'Grady said: \"Big Brother bosses do not get the best out of employees. \"Staff who are being snooped on are less productive and less healthy\". And the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development said: \"Employees that feel under excessive surveillance are also more likely to suffer from stress, so there needs to be a clear case for monitoring.\" They were joined by the privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch, which said: \"None of us should ever assume that what we do online during work hours or when using devices owned by our employer, such as computers, tablets or mobile phones, is private - but, equally, no employee should be in fear of being monitored by their boss.\" The judges' ruling, handed down on Tuesday, said Romania had not failed to uphold the right to a private life of its citizen Bogdan Barbulescu. Mr Barbulescu's employer had sacked him after finding he had been using a Yahoo Messenger account to speak to both his fiancee and his brother, despite having been asked to set up the account for work purposes only, the seven judges said. The company had also banned private use of the internet at work. When confronted, Mr Barbulescu had denied violating the policy, the judges found. And the company had therefore been justified in reading both the work and private correspondence on the account - some of it highly sensitive. Mr Barbulescu said his rights had been violated and, having been unsuccessful in arguing as much in the domestic courts, asked the judges to rule that Romania had failed in its duty to him. The court's decision does not introduce new measures. Reading the messages was already legal in Romania, as it is in other countries, including the UK. Rather, it agreed with the Romanian authorities that the circumstances in which Mr Barbulescu's messages had been read did not represent a breach of his right to a private life. The judges, in effect, declined to send a signal to courts across Europe that they considered surveillance under those circumstances unacceptable. If the judges had found the other way, the Romanian government would have been obliged to abide by their decision. Others, however, would not, because European Court of Human Rights decisions affect only the country named in the case. The effect on domestic courts is different. Each country adopts its own approach to the court's decisions. In the UK, for example, judges are obliged to take them into account, not to follow them without question, as has sometimes been claimed. Moreover, the court's decision did not actually go further than existing UK laws, which already allowed some reading of employees' communications under certain circumstances. One of the seven judges, who disagreed with his colleagues, did say that the blanket ban on private internet use at work imposed by Mr Barbulescu's former employer was unacceptable and there should be stricter regulation of when and how bosses should be allowed to carry out such surveillance. The case before the court considered the specific circumstances in which Mr Barbulescu found himself - rather than workplace surveillance as a whole - and agreed that they were not a breach of his rights. So, avoiding those would be a good start. In the UK, the amount of access employers have to employees' communications is defined by a series of laws and regulations that balance when it is lawful against when it is proportionate and necessary. Essex University professor of EU and human rights law Steve Peers told the BBC: \"Employees might be violating employer policies if they install software to block tracking. \"It is best for people to stick to company policy on use of work equipment and use their own smartphones if they need to do something personal. \"Definitely the wisest course for people whose company policies allow their work emails to be read - or who believe their employer would do it anyway - is to use their own phone or tablet, and use mobile data if they can, instead of employer wi-fi.\" Apps that use end-to-end encryption, such as Signal, WhatsApp and others, provide an extra level of security. Broadly, \"the legal principles should be similar across Europe, particularly regarding personal data, as this is derived from EU legislation\", said Kathryn Dooks, an employment partner at the law firm Kemp Little. But some domestic laws and regulations would differ, she told the BBC. The banking regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, requires banking companies to \"take reasonable steps to record relevant telephone conversations, and keep a copy of relevant electronic communications\" on company equipment. FCA-regulated businesses must also take steps to stop staff sending work messages on their own equipment. According to a 2014 Financial Times article, some banks became so concerned employees, aware they were being watched, would move to non-work channels to engage in illicit behaviour that they started comparing performance against average internal communications channel use.",

Media playback is not supported on this device His team defeated the Kiwis 20-14 to clinch the series 2-1 in the last game before his current deal expired. \"We will sit down, assess it and look at it,\" said McNamara, who has been in charge since 2010. \"These are the sort of things you deal with post-tournament, there is a process and I'm in no rush.\" Media playback is not supported on this device The former Bradford Bulls boss, 44, is also out of contract with club side Sydney Roosters, where he is attack coach. It has been reported that McNamara has agreed a new two-year deal with the Australian National Rugby League side. McNamara initially coached England on a full-time basis but has combined the position with his job at the Roosters since 2013. He went into Saturday's match with a record of only two wins in 11 matches against the world's top two sides - New Zealand and Australia. Former Great Britain international Garry Schofield - now an outspoken columnist - claimed before the game that there was \"no debate about it, he has to go\". But the series win strengthens McNamara's prospects of a deal that will take him through to the 2017 World Cup. The last significant series win against either the Kiwis or Australia was Great Britain's 3-0 triumph over New Zealand in 2007. Since then there have been numerous near misses, including a 20-18 World Cup semi-final defeat against the Kiwis at Wembley in 2013 and two narrow Four Nations defeats in 2014. England took the lead in the current series with victory in Hull but they were defeated 9-2 at the Olympic Stadium to set up Saturday's thrilling conclusion. \"It's an incredible feeling,\" added McNamara. \"The players completely deserve it after working tirelessly. \"Success hasn't until this point come for the team, but thankfully they've finally got what they deserve. \"New Zealand are the number one team in the world and have dominated international rugby league in a physical sense. We've been able to match that in three consecutive games. \"We've got quality and experience to add to our group. \"We've got a good, young bunch that is ready to play for a number of years so the signs are pretty strong for us moving forward, particularly now we've got across the line.\" The England team that competes in the 2016 Four Nations could be significantly stronger - with Sam Burgess, George Burgess, Sam Tomkins and Jack Reed all missing from the current series. Canterbury Bulldogs prop James Graham was in the GB team that defeated the Kiwis in 2007 but many in the current England side had never experienced a major series win. \"The pressure has been released,\" said the former St Helens player. \"The win will help breathe confidence into the less experienced lads but we cannot get carried away. The big thing for the England team is to kick on and win a major tournament.\" And the 30-year-old was one of numerous players to back McNamara to continue in his role as England coach. \"It is a no-brainer,\" he said when asked whether the coach should stay on. \"If he wants the job, then I see no reason why not. There is no need to change it.\" McNamara made two changes to his side for the final Test, bringing in winger Jermaine McGillvary and Wigan scrum-half Matty Smith, who won the man-of-the-match award. \"I think Steve has been building something good,\" added Smith. \"I do not see any reason why we need to change the coach now. \"We have been building nicely and now we have won something.\" New Zealand coach Stephen Kearney was gracious in defeat - praising the quality of England over the three games. But he also acknowledged how the number of Englishmen playing for Australian clubs in the NRL had helped the national team. Gareth Widdop, Graham, Josh Hodgson, Thomas Burgess and Mike Cooper all played in the NRL last season - and Kearney said: \"It is certainly of benefit. \"For 26 rounds in the NRL it is survival of the fittest, high-intensity football. That is helping to condition the Burgess lads and Widdop, those types of players, for sure.\"",

        "article": "The \"furore\" in the UK housing market is dying down because a recent surge in demand is \"gradually exhausting itself\", according to surveyors. The increase in would-be buyers was at its lowest point in almost a year during February, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) said. Better mortgage deals have helped absorb some of the \"pent-up demand\", the trade body added. But prices are still likely to continue rising, according to Rics. Separately, figures from mortgage lenders show that the government's recently launched Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme seems to have reduced the size of the average deposit required of first-time buyers. The Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) said that in January, the average first-time deposit had fallen to 18%, from 20% in December. However, the number of loans to first-time buyers, and to those moving from a home they already own, fell back because of the normal seasonal lull in the market at this time of year. The number of mortgages granted to home buyers in January was 16% down from December, but was still 30% higher than in January last year, reflecting the upsurge in sales in the past 12 months. This lull in activity may continue according to Simon Rubinsohn, Rics' chief economist. \"The growth in buyer numbers that we've seen for some months started to slow down in February, as the surge in interest sparked towards the end of last summer began to level off,\" he said. \"While this certainly doesn't mean an end to the increasing activity we've been seeing recently, it does suggest that the pent up demand generated throughout the downturn is gradually exhausting itself.\" One other reason for the slowdown could have been last month's bad weather, especially the floods, making people less likely to view properties, Mr Rubinsohn added. But there are still too few properties coming on to the market, Rics said, which means prices are likely to keep going up. The cost of a home in the UK continued to rise during February, albeit at a slightly slower pace than in previous month, the organisation said. It said 45% more chartered surveyors saw prices rise rather than fall in February. According to its surveys, the cost of a home has now risen across the country for 11 consecutive months. According to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), released in February, the average price of a UK has now hit \u00c2\u00a3250,000 for the first time. The ONS said house prices rose by 5.5% last year. However, other reports carry much lower estimates. One of the UK's biggest mortgage lenders, the Nationwide Building Society, says the average UK home is now worth \u00c2\u00a3177,846 with annual prices rising more than 9%.",

Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has pledged \u00e2\u201a\u00ac50m (\u00c2\u00a342m) in funds for rebuilding. At least 268 people are now known to have died and 400 were injured. Teams have continued to search the rubble of toppled buildings for a second night. However, hundreds of aftershocks have hampered the efforts of the 5,000 rescuers. Another magnitude-4.7 tremor struck early on Friday. In addition to the funds, Mr Renzi cancelled taxes for residents and announced a new initiative, \"Italian Homes\", to tackle criticism over shoddy construction. But he also said that it was \"absurd\" to think that Italy could build completely quake-proof buildings. It follows criticism in the Italian press over building standards in high-risk areas. Some of the buildings that collapsed had recently been renovated. Historic towns do not have to conform to anti-quake building regulations, which are also often not applied when new buildings are put up. The 6.2-magnitude quake hit in the early hours of Wednesday, 100km (65 miles) north-east of Rome in mountainous central Italy. The worst affected towns - Amatrice, Arquata, Accumoli and Pescara del Tronto - are usually sparsely populated but have been swelled by tourists visiting for summer, making estimates for the precise number missing difficult. More than 200 people died in Amatrice alone. At least three Britons died in the quake, a local official in Amatrice told the BBC. The Romanian government said 11 of its citizens were missing. Bodies are still being found in the town, including one discovered in the rubble of the Hotel Roma in the city late on Thursday. An official with the fire department, Lorenzo Botti, admitted they were facing a race against time. \"The chances of finding people alive in these conditions, in this type of setting, well, it's challenging,\" he said. But other rescuers said there was still hope, noting that one survivor was pulled from ruins in L'Aquila in 2009 three days after an earthquake that killed more than 300 people. Search teams have asked locals to disable their wi-fi passwords to help rescue workers communicate more effectively. Police have also arrested a man for attempting to break into and loot an empty home in the town, Ansa reported.",

The band are in the middle of their latest tour and are currently playing a string of concerts in Los Angeles. They paid tribute to Sheehan on the video screens at Wednesday night's show, said Billboard reporter Shirley Halperin. As he introduced the song Iris, from their latest album Songs of Innocence, Bono said: \"U2 is kind of family. We look after each other and it takes a lot to put on a show like tonight. \"Last night we lost a member of our family. Dennis Sheehan was his name. He was U2's tour manager for 33 years. He loved, as we all do, the city of Los Angeles and he called the Sunset Marquis his 'home away from home'. \"He came to this city as a young man in the 70s, working for Led Zeppelin. He always thought maybe U2 could be the next Led Zeppelin, which of course is impossible.\" Sheehan, who was in his late 60s, had worked with other rock legends including Iggy Pop, Patti Smith and Lou Reed. Los Angeles County Fire Inspector Chris Reade said a medical response team was sent to the Sunset Marquis hotel at around 0530 (1330 GMT) on Wednesday to reports of a man in cardiac arrest. Sheehan was pronounced dead at the scene.

Fifa said investigations into such claims were ongoing and, as yet, there was no evidence of wrongdoing. The bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 tournaments is the subject of a Swiss criminal investigation. Asked if countries had any choice other than to bribe Fifa during the bidding process, Tognoni replied: \"This speculation is permitted, yes.\" Russia and Qatar deny wrongdoing, while Blatter has not been named in a separate US criminal investigation into widespread corruption at Fifa. Domenico Scala, head of Fifa's audit and compliance committee, said if evidence emerges from either the US or Swiss investigations which shows the result was affected by bought votes, the \"awards could be cancelled\". However, Tognoni, who was Blatter's right-hand man for a period in the mid-90s and again between 2001-2003, said he did not think the World Cups would be taken away from Russia or Qatar. \"Even if there is evidence that Fifa people were bribed, where is the problem? With Fifa, or the people who had no choice but to get the World Cup with bribing?\" In response, Fifa said in a statement on Monday: \"Fifa initiated the investigation by the Swiss authorities precisely to answer questions such as this. \"However, while investigations are ongoing, it should be noted that to date, no evidence has come to light to suggest there are any legal grounds for rescinding the current Fifa World Cup selections.\" Seven senior Fifa officials were arrested last month in high-profile dawn raids at a Zurich hotel, where they had been staying before the presidential election. They are among 14 people charged by US prosecutors, who allege that bribes and kickbacks of more than $150m (\u00a3100m) were accepted over a 24-year period. Blatter, Fifa president since 1998, was re-elected at the Zurich meeting but announced four days later that he would resign amid the corruption allegations engulfing the organisation. American lawyer Michael Garcia was previously hired by Fifa to investigate the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bidding processes, but he complained that the published summary of his 430-page report was an \"erroneous\" representation of his work. The report cleared World Cup hosts Russia and Qatar of wrongdoing. Garcia quit weeks later over Fifa's handling of his inquiry and his comments reopened the debate about the validity of the bidding process.

He also suggested that prolonging the life of Nelson Mandela had been an \"affront\" to his dignity. His comments follow a U-turn by former Archbishop of Canterbury Lord Carey, who also said he would support assisted dying for the terminally ill. The Church of England (CofE) has called for an inquiry into the issue. In his column the 82-year-old retired Anglican Archbishop of South Africa said: \"I think when you need machines to help you breathe, then you have to ask questions about the quality of life being experienced and about the way money is being spent.\" He also described as \"disgraceful\" how former South African leader Nelson Mandela was kept alive with intensive hospitalisation in the final stages of his life and was photographed with various visiting politicians. He said: \"You could see Madiba [Nelson Mandela] was not fully there. He did not speak. He was not connecting. My friend was no longer himself. It was an affront to Madiba's dignity. \"Yes, I think a lot of people would be upset if I said I wanted assisted dying. I would say I wouldn't mind actually.\" He said: \"I have been fortunate to spend my life working for dignity for the living. Now I wish to apply my mind to the issue of dignity for the dying. I revere the sanctity of life - but not at any cost.\" His comments follow those of Lord Carey, who wrote in the Daily Mail that he had dropped his opposition to the Assisted Dying Bill - due for debate in the House of Lords on Friday - \"in the face of the reality of needless suffering\". \"The fact is that I have changed my mind. The old philosophical certainties have collapsed in the face of the reality of needless suffering,\" he wrote. The 1961 Suicide Act makes it an offence to encourage or assist a suicide or a suicide attempt in England and Wales. Anyone doing so could face up to 14 years in prison. The law is almost identical in Northern Ireland. There is no specific law on assisted suicide in Scotland, creating some uncertainty, although in theory someone could be prosecuted under homicide legislation. There have already been several attempts to legalise assisted dying, but these have been rejected. The Commission on Assisted Dying, established and funded by campaigners who have been calling for a change in the law, concluded in 2012 that there was a \"strong case\" for allowing assisted suicide for people who are terminally ill in England and Wales. But the medical profession and disability rights groups, among others, argue that the law should not be changed because it is there to protect the vulnerable in society. In other countries, such as Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, legislation has been introduced to allow assisted dying. France is considering a possible introduction of similar legislation, although there is opposition from its medical ethics council. Campaign group Dignity in Dying predicts that a lot more countries will follow suit. However, the current Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, regards the Assisted Dying Bill as \"mistaken and dangerous\" and the Church of England (CofE) wants to see an inquiry into the issue. The Church said a Royal Commission would include expert opinion and could carefully assess the various arguments. It believes the current bill should be withdrawn to allow that inquiry to take place - a call rejected by Lord Falconer, the Labour peer who tabled it. Some 110 peers are already listed to speak in the House of Lords when the bill is debated on Friday.

Three were killed in Dungog, where homes have been washed away by flooding. An 86-year-old woman died in the Central Hunter region when her car was swept into floodwaters. Emergency services have declared 12 communities natural disaster areas. The fierce weather is expected to ease later on Thursday. All severe weather warnings have been cancelled across NSW. The storm has left some areas devastated, with roads flooded, homes swept away and power poles snapped. Emergency Services Minister David Elliott told ABC News that it would be some time before the full cost of the disaster is known. He said: \"There are cells still active off the coast of New South Wales, and indeed the fact that the flood waters may well still increase, means that we won't know the entire cost of this particular disaster for many days to come.\" Some 190,000 homes in the state are still without power but state-owned supplier Ausgrid said that electricity had been restored to 30,000 properties. During the days of stormy weather, parts of NSW experienced more than 30cm (one foot) of rainfall, wind gusts of more than 100km/h (60mph) and waves reaching record heights of 15m (50ft). On Wednesday, police divers retrieved the body of a missing woman whose car was swept off a causeway in Maitland, near Newcastle.

Earlier, rising river levels also threatened more than 200 homes in south-western districts of Sydney and forced residents to evacuate. The flood risk has eased since then but local media report that it is still a concern to authorities. There is still some travel disruption in Sydney, with a number of roads closed due to flooding. An Anzac day event for 10,000 people in the capital has also been affected. The camping event was due to take place on Friday night but has been postponed because of the stormy weather.

Cassie Sainsbury, 22, was stopped at an airport in Bogota on 12 April. She could face up to 25 years in jail, according to her sister, Khala. The drugs were hidden inside 15 pairs of headphones that Ms Sainsbury bought during a holiday, the family said. Ms Sainsbury's family claims she is innocent of drug trafficking charges. Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade confirmed it was providing consular assistance, but did not give further details. The personal trainer, from Adelaide, had just finished a working holiday when she was arrested at El Dorado International Airport, her family said. Ms Sainsbury's mother, Lisa Evans, claimed her daughter was the \"naive\" victim of a Colombian man she had befriended during her trip. \"The day of her departure, he came up to her hotel, gave her a package that was wrapped in black plastic and she took it and put it in her luggage,\" she told Australian radio station KIIS FM. \"And this is where the naive bit comes in, she didn't even rip it open to make sure there were headphones in there.\" They said she was being held at El Buen Pastor, Colombia's largest women's prison. The family has started an online campaign to help cover legal fees, raising A$2,600 (\u00c2\u00a31,500; $2,000) in four days. Penalties for possession, use, or trafficking of illegal drugs in Colombia are severe and offenders can expect long prison sentences under harsh conditions. According to Ms Evans, Ms Sainsbury's lawyer has recommended a guilty plea to avoid a maximum sentence up to 25 years in jail. If Ms Sainsbury pleads guilty, she would face a six-year sentence, which could be reduced further if she gives information about the man who supplied the headphones, Ms Evans said. Colombia is one of the world's largest producers of coca leaves and cocaine. Highly pure cocaine costs more than A$350 per gram in Australia, making it proportionally the most lucrative market in the world, according to the Global Drug Survey 2015, According to a government website, Colombia's official working holiday visa may only be obtained by citizens of Chile, France, Mexico and Peru.",

The Gills are in the relegation zone following a run of one win in 12 games. Taylor told BBC Radio Kent: \"If the chairman picked up the phone and said 'Peter, that's it, you're not having any longer' I would totally understand. Media playback is not supported on this device \"The majority of the fans probably want me out. What I would like to have here is a lot more time.\" Gillingham have only won three of their 16 league games this season and are currently two points from safety. Taylor led the club to 17th place in League One last season after taking charge in October, initially as interim manager, and subsequently targeted a mid-table finish this season. The 61-year-old received the backing of Scally last month but accepts that it is hard for supporters to show patience while they are struggling. \"I understand the fans' frustrations. We were all expecting a better season than we are having,\" he said. \"We are in a bit of a hole and need to dig ourselves out of it. \"I really do feel that there is a good squad here but we are not showing it at the moment. I would love longer. \"One win in 12 league matches is not good enough. I lost my job at Palace when we had one defeat in five. \"If the chairman sacked me I couldn't complain and I wouldn't complain. Me and the chairman wouldn't fall out either. I am not going to walk away. I am desperate to turn it around and I do honestly feel I will do. I am very determined to.\" Taylor overhauled Gillingham's squad during the summer, making eight permanent signings. He says injuries have played a part in their struggles so far this season, with goalkeeper Stuart Nelson (thumb), utility man Aaron Morris (hamstring), midfielder Doug Loft (Achilles) and striker Danny Kedwell (knee) all missing chunks of the campaign. \"If we'd have had no injures whatsoever then I would expect to be gone by now,\" Taylor, who had a spell as England's caretaker manager in 2000, said. \"There are reasons why we have got a lack of form and confidence. \"I don't think I've ever been able to put a consistent team out. It doesn't half mess you about when you are a squad of our size in League One. \"You need your best players available all the time. Too many times, we have had some important players unavailable and that would affect any team. \"I don't want to make excuses but I just want to clear it up with people out there that are unhappy.

The Baggies took the lead before the break when Saido Berahino finished well, before Craig Dawson doubled the lead in the 54th minute with a header. Media playback is not supported on this device A minute later Lukaku rose to nod in Gerard Deulofeu's cross, and then set up Arouna Kone who fired in to level. Belgium striker Lukaku grabbed the winner with a close-range strike from another excellent Deulofeu delivery. The result moves Everton up to fifth on 12 points, while West Brom, who have yet to win at home, drop to 15th with eight points. It was a certainly a game of two halves, following a dire opening 40 minutes, but Lukaku himself had a contrasting 90 minutes. The 6ft 3in 22-year-old has had to carry the burden of a \u00a328m price tag ever since he signed on a permanent deal for the Toffees in July 2014, following a successful season on loan in 2013-14. Media playback is not supported on this device And despite scoring 20 goals last season, his performances were mixed, which prompted manager Roberto Martinez to defend him. Everton fans must have been wondering which Lukaku they would see at The Hawthorns. They saw both. The left side of the graphic below shows that Lukaku found himself in deep positions in the first half as he tried to get into the game. However, with Everton chasing the match after the break, he moved further forward and became more of a threat in and around the area. The service also improved from Spaniard Deulofeu, who delivered two fantastic crosses for the Belgian's goals. For a team that came into the game having conceded only six goals in six matches, shipping three goals in one half would be a surprise to the casual observer. However, two injuries caused the Baggies' tight defence to become flaky. The first occurred when Gareth McAuley was hurt in training prior to the match, and the second when Jonas Olsson came off in the 28th minute with what appeared to be a groin problem. Everton's defence also looked brittle in the first half, which again could be attributed to injuries, with John Stones, Seamus Coleman and Leighton Baines missing. Fortunately for the inexperienced backline, the team's emphasis focused on attack as they chased the game after the break. West Brom boss Tony Pulis: \"The first goal kills us. We should deal with it. The other two goals are poor goals - the second one looks offside, the linesman is looking the wrong side. It's a poor decision. \"It's really, really disappointing because before we scored the second goal we had some good chances. We switched off and Everton will punish you.\" Everton manager Roberto Martinez: \"We were very disappointed with the first half. We were off, every single individual. \"The mountain we had to climb, it would have been easy to lose focus but we got three goals against the best defensive structure in the Premier League. \"Every three points is huge but it feels extra good. Deulofeu took extra responsibility, he wanted the ball all night and it was a real mature performance.\" BBC Radio 5 live's Steve Claridge at the Hawthorns: \"Everton looked far more comfortable when they threw the shackles off and went for it. Going 2-0 down was the best thing that could happen to them.\" A brilliant win sets Roberto Martinez's Everton up nicely for Sunday's Merseyside derby at Goodison Park, with Liverpool only a point behind them in the table. As for West Brom, they are away at seventh-place Crystal Palace on Saturday.",

Elias Kachunga had put Huddersfield ahead just four minutes earlier with his fifth goal of the season when he combined with Tommy Smith to fire home. Nahki Wells then struck the bar before Jutkiewicz netted the equaliser after the hosts failed to clear David Cotterill's dangerous free-kick. The draw kept Huddersfield third, while Birmingham moved up to seventh. Huddersfield started much the brighter side and Birmingham goalkeeper Tomasz Kuszczak was forced to save long-range shots from Wells and Chris Lowe. Kuszczak also held onto Jonathan Hogg's 30-yard effort before Smith skimmed the bar with a rising shot as Town dominated possession. But the Blues came to life after Kachunga's opener with Jutkiewicz heading in after Jonathan Grounds kept the ball alive, and they could have won it when Ryan Shotton headed wide late on. Huddersfield's second draw of the season means they have not won in nine home league meetings against Birmingham - a run stretching back to October 1996. Huddersfield manager David Wagner:  \"I always feel we are able to score and we had some good opportunities. \"There was a clear penalty and the free-kick for the goal was not a foul in my opinion, but we have to accept that. Overall the performance was good. \"We know that if we stick together and show our identity on the pitch in every game we are competitive in this league.\" Birmingham manager Gary Rowett: \"I would certainly have taken a point after the first half. In the first half we didn't do enough and didn't show Championship quality. \"In the second half I thought we grew into the game and we made two brave attacking substitutions.

        "article": "PE should be given the same status as maths, English, science and Welsh in schools to help tackle obesity in Wales, experts have recommended. A group chaired by Paralympic multi-gold medallist Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson says it would be the first country in the world to take that step. It would mean more time for sport, but unions worry too many core curriculum subjects could dilute their importance. The Welsh government said it would consider the recommendation. Education Minister Leighton Andrews said he wanted to look into how schools can increase levels of physical activity in children and young people. By Arwyn JonesBBC Wales education correspondent Although the need for more exercise is clear enough, it isn't just a simple matter of adding PE as a core subject. Pupils in Wales already have as core subjects Welsh, English, maths and sciences. They are the areas the government has decided should have most time and resources allocated to them. And teaching unions fear the more you add to that core, the less of a priority they each become. More than one-third are either overweight or obese, costing the Welsh NHS more than \u00a370m a year. The current core subjects in schools in Wales are English, Welsh (as a first language), mathematics, and science, while physical education is a foundation subject. Having PE elevated to a core part of the curriculum would mean more time devoted to it, as well as extra resources and more training for teachers. Schools would also need to give greater priority to provision for PE. As a result: \u2022 Teachers would be required to be competent to deliver the subject on completion of their initial teacher training. \u2022 Well qualified, specialist teachers would be needed to work with schools to ensure high-quality provision. \u2022 Standards and provision in physical education would be rigorously reviewed in school, both by the educational consortia and by schools inspectorate Estyn. \u2022 Progress would be regularly measured. The move to give PE more status in schools would be a bold move but an important one, according to the group. In its report, the group, which also included the chair of Sports Wales Laura McAllister, said: \"Given the Welsh government's commitment to making physical literacy as important a development skill as reading and writing, the group felt that changing the status of physical education is the only credible and secure way of ensuring this.\" But while teaching unions support the idea, they are worried that too many subjects on the core curriculum could dilute their importance. Dr Philip Dixon, director of ATL Cymru, said it was important to decide on \"what small core we want\". \"We certainly want literacy and numeracy in there,\" he said. \"We may well want physical education in there too, that's for the government to decide. \"But the core has to be kept very small or else we'll see a core which isn't a core and that's just ridiculous.\" Owen Hathway, Wales policy officer at the NUT, also warned that schools already had a heavy curriculum in Wales. \"We are constantly being told that literacy and numeracy is a priority, \" he said. \"Science is being pushed as a priority with its importance to future PISA testing. We have the core subjects of maths, English, Welsh and so on already in place, while IT is also being promoted as a priority. \"Quite simply, by the nature of the word, not everything can be a priority.\" Responding to the report, Education Minister Leighton Andrews said he would be considering the report in the context of the wider review of the national curriculum and assessment. \"We firmly believe in the positive impact that physical activity can have on the people and nation of Wales and I'm determined to ensure that sport continues to make an important contribution to Welsh life,\" he added. Sport Minister John Griffiths said sport was important as it improves health and wellbeing, along with helping with team building and making friends. \"We are committed to widening access and encouraging greater participation in physical activity as the health benefits of making physical exercise a part of everyone's daily lives is well-understood,\" he added.",

        "article": "World leaders have welcomed the narrow election victory of Greece's broadly pro-bailout New Democracy party and urged Athens to form a cabinet quickly. The             eurozone group  said reforms were Greece's \"best guarantee\" to overcome tough economic and social challenges. European markets were mixed in morning trading, after Asia had recorded earlier gains. The Syriza party, which rejected the bailout terms and came a close second, said it would lead the opposition. With 99.9% of ballots counted, interior ministry results put New Democracy on 29.7% of the vote (129 seats), Syriza on 26.9% (71) and the socialist Pasok on 12.3% (33). There are 300 seats in parliament and Greece has a rule that gives the leading party 50 extra seats. Greek voters had gone to the polls on Sunday following inconclusive elections in May. New Democracy leader Antonis Samaras said Greeks had chosen to stay in the euro and called for a \"national salvation government\". By Gavin HewittEurope editor If Antonis Samaras is confirmed in power he will have a stronger opposition breathing down his neck. He will say to Europe that he has anchored Greece in the eurozone and wants something in return. That will be difficult. Already German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle has come out and said that the substance of the Greek reform bailout programme is non-negotiable. Where there might be some flexibility is over the timing of the implementation of reforms. There may also be some movement over interest rates on the loans and the EU might offer Greece some funds to boost growth. But the message is clear; the austerity programme with its budget and spending cuts will stay.  The German finance minister underlined that message when he said: \"Greece's path will be neither short nor easy\". He is now meeting President Carolos Papoulias, who is expected to give him the mandate to try to form a government. Syriza's leader Alexis Tsipras said his party would not take part in the government, and would instead become a powerful anti-austerity voice in the opposition. The BBC's Mark Lowen, in Athens, says Mr Samaras is expected to try for a broad coalition, hoping to create a stable government with a stronger popular mandate. He says Mr Samaras will push for a lightening of the bailout terms from Brussels, arguing that Greeks have accepted more pain by electing a pro-bailout party and that Europe should now cut Greece some slack. However, correspondents also point out that only 40% of voters backed parties that broadly support the bail-out deal with the EU and the IMF. Tough austerity measures were attached to the two international bailouts awarded to Greece, an initial package worth 110bn euros (\u00c2\u00a389bn; $138bn) in 2010, then a follow-up last year worth 130bn euros. Sunday's vote was watched around the world, amid fears that a Greek exit from the euro could spread contagion to other eurozone members and deepen the turmoil in the global economy. European stock markets were mixed in morning trading. Asian shares had earlier advanced. Japan's Nikkei 225 index and South Korea's Kospi both closed up 1.8%. BBC business editor Robert Peston says the election results have been seen by investors as avoiding the worst short-term outcome, which would have been political paralysis followed by a messy exit from the euro. In a statement on behalf of the 17 eurozone finance ministers, Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Paul Juncker said that \"continued fiscal and structural reforms are Greece's best guarantee to overcome the current economic and social challenges and for a more prosperous future of Greece in the euro area\". Election as it happenedProfile: Antonis Samaras In pictures: Greek elections In             a joint statement  European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso and European Council President Herman Van Rompuy also hailed the result, and expressed hope that a government would be formed quickly. German Chancellor Angela Merkel telephoned Mr Samaras to congratulate him on his victory. A German government statement said she had \"stated that she would work on the basis that Greece will meet its European commitments\". The US stressed that it was in everyone's interests \"for Greece to remain in the euro area\". Mr Samaras said that the Greek people had voted to stay in the eurozone. \"There is no time to waste,\" he said. \"A national salvation government must bring economic growth and reassure Greeks the worst is over.\" He added: \"There will be no more adventures. Greece's place in Europe will not be put in doubt,\" promising that Athens would \"honour its obligations\". Our correspondent, Mark Lowen, says this suggests that Mr Samaras wants to press ahead with spending cuts demanded by the country's international creditors. European leaders have warned that if the new Greek government rejects the bailout, the country could be forced to abandon the single currency. New Democracy should be able to build a majority coalition with the socialist Pasok. However, coalition talks may not be easy. In addition to Syriza's showing, four other parties which oppose or want a radical overhaul of the bailout look set to take between 60 and 70 seats. They include the far-right Golden Dawn, which has about 7% of the vote. The leader of Pasok, Evangelos Venizelos, proposed a broad four-party coalition including New Democracy, Pasok, the Democratic Left and Syriza. \"No decision can be taken without this national unity,\" he said.",

At the stroke of midnight on 31 December, as the glitter ball in Times Square makes its annual descent, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is due to end his term in office. The manoeuvring to succeed him - at present it is too genteel to describe it as a fight - is now moving into higher gear. Just as Campaign 2016 could end up with the election of the first female US president, there's a strong possibility that the next head of the UN will become the organisation's first female secretary-general. This week, for the first time in the 70-year history of the UN, the declared candidates will take part in public hustings. This is a radical departure for an organisation that rivals the Vatican in the shadowy secrecy of its executive recruitment process, with its monochrome backrooms hosting the UN equivalent of the papal conclave in the Sistine Chapel. Those who have so far put their names forward, half of them women, will face two hours of questioning from member states. To support their applications, they've also been asked to post their curricula vitae online and to compose a 2,000-word vision statement articulating how they would run an organisation with 30 separate agencies, funds and programmes and 40,000 staff, not to mention 193 member states. What has long been a ridiculously closeted and opaque process is being made more inclusive and transparent. The aim is to turn it into something bearing at least some resemblance to a regular interview process, a far cry from the stealth selection procedure that produced Mr Ban. When the South Korean was jockeying for the job, he shied away from campaigning inside the UN headquarters he would soon end up running. Eight candidates have so far declared and most are from Eastern Europe. Under an unwritten rule of regional rotation, a diplomatic version of \"Buggins' turn\", this geographical bloc is next in line to fill the vacancy. To a global audience, most of the candidates are \"need-to-Google\" figures. Top row (from left): Bottom row (from left): More information on the candidates and the selection procedure is available on the UN's website The field is expected to grow. Kristalina Georgieva, a Bulgarian who is a vice-president of the European Commission, might yet be persuaded to run and may well be Mr Ban's preferred choice. In a move that boosted her UN profile, he selected the former World Bank official to co-chair a panel looking into the funding of humanitarian aid. However, the Bulgarian government is backing Ms Bokova, who heads the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco), and Ms Georgieva herself has indicated that she intends to pay \"full attention\" for the time being to her EU responsibilities. Kevin Rudd, the former Australian Prime Minister, has long made the UN secretary-general's job the target of his immense personal ambition. Then there is the wild card. Many diplomats would like to see German Chancellor Angela Merkel throw her giant-sized hat in the ring. More of a general than a secretary, Mrs Merkel is precisely the kind of big hitter that many UN watchers believe the organisation desperately needs after the more timid leadership style of Mr Ban. For all the attempts to modernise the process it could never be described as democratic. Nowhere near. Under the selection procedure, the 15-member Security Council recommends a single candidate for the 193-member General Assembly to essentially rubber stamp. Thus, the power still resides with the permanent five members of the Security Council - China, France, Russia, the UK and US - which can all veto candidates. The US, for instance, vetoed Boutros Boutros-Ghali, when the Egyptian sought a second five-year term. Though the hustings may be held in public, the next UN secretary-general will be the candidate who emerges from backroom bargaining, mainly involving the US and Russia. What's more important than the candidates' CVs, then, is whether at any stage of their careers they have displeased the permanent \"P5\" members. This is a headache for Ms Bokova, who as head of Unesco, admitted the Palestinians into the organisation, against the express wishes of the US, which retaliated by cutting off funding. She is also seen as Moscow's preferred choice, which means the US is almost certain to block her. As for her fellow Bulgarian, Ms Georgieva could pay a price for the EU's sanctions against Russia. Others fail what's been called the \"testicular test\". Despite the new-found openness of the process, UN reformers had been lobbying for more sweeping changes to the selection process. The 1 for 7 Billion campaign, an umbrella group bringing together NGOs from all over the world, has urged the Security Council to recommend two candidates to the General Assembly, something the P5 veto-wielders would never sanction. They would also prefer to see the new secretary-general appointed to a single seven-year term, rather than the present practice of serving two five-year terms. Again, that will not happen. So despite calls for a strong figurehead for the UN - that general rather than secretary idea - the present system means that compromise candidates inevitably emerge, who are not necessarily the most able but the least objectionable to the P5 countries. Rather than a big name, the UN could easily end up with a leader little known outside diplomatic circles, a new secretary-general whom most of the world will have to Google.",

The field is expected to grow, with Kristalina Georgieva, a Bulgarian vice-president of the European Commission, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel being mentioned as possible contenders.

        "article": "In the week since Donald Trump effectively secured the Republican presidential nomination, a great deal of ink and airtime have been devoted to explaining why he will have a difficult time winning the presidency in the autumn. The Republican Party is too badly divided. His rhetoric is too incendiary. Republican voters may be \"idiots\", but the general public is wiser. The US electoral map, which places a premium on winning key high-population \"swing\" states, is tilted against the Republican Party. About that last point. On Tuesday a survey of three key swing states - Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania - revealed a virtual dead heat between the two likely standard-bearers. Those states - which account for 67 electoral votes - all went for Democrat Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. Add them to the states Republican Mitt Romney carried in 2012, and it delivers 273 electoral votes - three more than the 270 necessary to win the presidency. Throw in a national tracking poll released on Wednesday that has Donald Trump surging to within striking distance of Hillary Clinton, and it's a recipe for acute hyperventilation on the part of Democrats. But\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 cooler-heads respond. The Reuters/Ipsos national poll, which has Mrs Clinton ahead 41% to Mr Trump's 40% and 19% undecided, was conducted online. That Quinnipiac swing-state poll oversampled white voters - a demographic group that is more inclined to Republicans. In addition, it doesn't represent that big a shift from the group's battleground-state poll from last autumn, which undermines the theory that Mr Trump's support is growing. The news caused election guru Nate Silver to go on a Twitter tirade, asserting that it's way too early to start gaming out the state-by-state electoral map based on opinion polls. \"The election will go through a lot of twists and turns, and polls are noisy,\" he writes. \"Don't sweat individual polls or short-term fluctuations.\" Sweating polls is what US pundits and commentators do, however. And at the very least, signs that Mr Trump is within reach of Mrs Clinton should cast doubts on the early predictions that the Democrats will win in the autumn by historic, Goldwater-esque margins. Mr Trump has a pathway to the presidency. He may not get there. It is not the most likely outcome. But it's real. That linchpin of a Trump victory centres on the so-called Rust Belt - states like the aforementioned Pennsylvania and Ohio, as well as Michigan and Wisconsin. Even if Florida, due to its rapidly growing Hispanic population, goes to Mrs Clinton, Mr Trump could still win if he sweeps those states. It's a strategy that Mr Trump already appears to understand. \"We'll win places that a lot of people say you're not going to win, that as a Republican you can't win,\" Mr Trump said at an April rally in Indiana. \"Michigan is a great example; nobody else will go to Michigan. We're going to be encamped in Michigan because I think I can win it.\" The challenge for Mr Trump is that the mid-west, particularly, Wisconsin and Michigan, have served as a Democratic firewall that Republicans have been unable to penetrate since 1988. \"These states constantly intrigue Republican presidential strategists because the Democratic advantage in them depends largely on an act of political levitation: the ability to consistently win a slightly greater share of working-class white voters here than almost anywhere else,\" writes the Atlantic's Ronald Brownstein. If Mr Trump is to find success, then, he likely will have to finally win over this stubborn portion of the mid-western electorate or, perhaps, energise what Sean Trende of RealClear Politics has called the \"missing white voters\". Trende points to a national drop-off more than 3.5 million white voters from the elections of 2008 to 2012, when population growth should have resulted in an increase of 1.5 million. These voters, he theorised, were largely working-class whites who had previously supported iconoclasts like Ross Perot, the 1992 anti-free-trade independent candidate. It's the type of voter that Mr Trump, with his populist economic pitch, has been turning out in the Republican primaries. In 2012 Mr Obama beat Mr Romney by roughly 5 million votes. If Mr Trump can bring those disaffected white voters back to the polls in 2016, it would cut into that margin. If Mrs Clinton is unable to produce the record-setting turnout among young and minority voters that Mr Obama achieved, the gap shrinks further still. That's a lot of \"if's\", of course. Young and minority voters - particularly Hispanics - may yet turn out to the polls in high numbers, if only to cast ballots against Mr Trump. There are already indications of record-setting Hispanic voter registration in places like California. There's also the risk that Mr Trump's reliance on populist rhetoric and controversial views on immigration could lead white-collar voters to favour Mrs Clinton. For every disaffected member of the working-class he brings in, he could lose a suburban mum or college-educated businessman. Even giving Mr Trump the benefit of the doubt, and viewing the recent polls as a trend and not a blip, there are still more electoral scenarios that end up with Mrs Clinton in the White House come 2017. For Mr Trump, the political stars have to re-align in his favour. For Mrs Clinton, a general-election status quo likely means victory.",
        "target": "Donald Trump has a possible pathway to the presidency, despite early predictions of a historic loss. He could win by sweeping swing states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Michigan, which have traditionally voted Democratic. However, he faces challenges in winning over working-class white voters and energizing disaffected voters, while also avoiding losses among suburban and college-educated voters. Hillary Clinton still has a likely chance of victory, but the race could be closer than initially expected.",

        "article": "Patients are being put at risk by GPs being forced to carry out complex consultations in 10 minutes or under, the British Medical Association says. The doctors' union said patient care was undermined when GPs were forced to see as many as 60 patients a day. It called for more funding to allow GPs to spend at least 15 minutes with each patient. NHS England said consultation lengths were up to doctors and there were no national limits suggesting 10 minutes. However, the NHS Choices website does state that \"GPs spend an average of 8-10 minutes with each patient\" and advises patients to \"plan ahead to make sure you cover everything you want to discuss\". The BMA, which published a report on \"safe working in general practice\" earlier this month, called for a reorganisation and warned that GPs faced \"unsustainable pressure\" from increasing workload and staff shortages. The report said it was intended to \"stimulate discussion\" and put forward a model that could be used across the UK. Dr Nicola Hulme, a GP in Cheshire, said she found NHS England's comment about there being no national limit on appointment times \"insulting\". \"With the high levels of demand, we have to run 10-minute appointments,\" she said. \"To offer longer with the same number of appointments would extend our day to beyond the 12 hours we currently routinely work. \"I often run late so I can deal thoroughly with my patients' issues. \"Paperwork gets started routinely after 7pm. I rarely get home before 8pm, having started generally at 7.30am. \"Nobody goes into medicine for an easy ride, we are all hard workers, but the intensity and the demand are now at unsafe levels.\" Dr Ali Alibhai, who works in central London, said GPs now had to manage so many chronic diseases such as diabetes that a consultation as short as eight minutes was \"not appropriate any more for safe patient care\". Dr Brian Balmer, of the BMA's GPs' committee, said that, in an ageing population, many patients had complex multiple conditions that needed longer to treat. He warned that many GPs were being forced to truncate care and deliver an \"unsafe number of consultations\". He said consultations should be limited to 25 a day, about the same number recommended in many other EU countries. Dr Balmer added: \"We need a new approach that shakes up the way patients get their care from their local GP practice. \"The consultation time needs to increase to 15 minutes with the government providing on its promised funding to make this work.\" Health think tank the King's Fund said its analysis showed GPs were under \"huge pressure due to an increase in workload which has not been matched by a growth in funding or the workforce\". It also found the average length of consultations had increased due to the rising number of older patients with more complex conditions. King's Fund chief executive Chris Ham said general practice needed \"new investment to stop it falling apart\", but GPs must also embrace new methods such as giving more advice by phone and email. NHS England said the length of appointments was \"at the discretion of individual GP practices, based on patient need, and there are no national limits suggesting 10 minutes should be the norm\". It accepted that GPs were \"under pressure\", and said it was \"substantially increasing investment and reforming care to free up GPs to spend more time with patients\". In 2013, a rule saying GP appointment slots in England must be for a minimum of 10 minutes was scrapped. One patient, John White, from Somerset, said: \"I think those who get a 10-minute consultation with their GPs are lucky. \"At my doctors' surgery I cannot even book an appointment to see my GP. All we are offered is to book a 'telephone triage consultation' where your doctor will call you by telephone and decide whether a face-to-face appointment is warranted. \"I have had to wait in excess of two weeks for the telephone appointment.\" Another patient, Maggy Jackson, said: \"I have a brilliant GP who sees me for as long as I need. He always runs on time too. \"All I can say is if it wasn't for this practice I would be dead. They diagnosed a gangrenous hernia two years ago when I presented with horrendous pain and no appointment. I was given a full examination, morphine and was in hospital an hour later after their intervention.\" Nurse Liz Wright said appointment length was also an issue in nursing. \"In years gone by, I had either 15 or 20-minute appointments to see my patients,\" she said. \"This has now been cut to 10 minutes, in which to carry out triage, cervical smears, dressings, injections, contraceptive discussions and issuing of prescriptions and a whole range of ailments. \"This means that in a typical 7.5-hour shift, I see up to 42 patients, well above the recommended daily amount. \"In my opinion this is unsafe practice and I have decided to take early retirement.\"",

The labour peer, who died in December, was accused of sex offences against children - which his family deny. The hearings, part of the Goddard Inquiry into child sexual abuse, were due to start in September but have been put back because of other inquiries. Leicestershire Police and the IPCC are investigating people allegedly linked to the case. The Goddard Inquiry, chaired by Dame Lowell Goddard, set to be the biggest public inquiry in British history, held a preliminary hearing earlier for its investigation into the former Leicester MP, one of 13 cases it has announced so far. On Monday, the IPCC announced 11 people are to be investigated over their handling of allegations against the peer. Announcing the delay Ben Emmerson QC, counsel to the inquiry, said there are \"good reasons to reconsider on timing and structure of the hearings.\" He said the Leicestershire force and the IPCC (Independent Police Complaints Commission) will soon interview complainants and witnesses who are also scheduled to give evidence. Postponement was \"only responsible\" in the circumstances, meaning the public hearings will now commence on 7 March 2017 and conclude by the end of May. Mr Emmerson revealed 33 alleged victims of Lord Janner have now been granted core participant status in the inquiry, meaning they have the right to make statements, see documents and seek permission to ask questions. Seven organisations and institutions, including the Labour Party, have previously been given the same status, which has also been granted to two individual police officers, including current Derbyshire chief constable Mick Creedon, who investigated Lord Janner for the Leicestershire force in the early 1990s. The inquiry has not received an application for core participant status from Lord Janner's family, but Mr Emmerson said there was \"ongoing correspondence with their legal representatives\". There have been suggestions from the family, Mr Emmerson said, that it would be \"unfair\" for the inquiry to make findings of fact because Lord Janner is unable to defend himself and alleged victims will not be subject to cross-examination. He said that in some cases it will be necessary to make findings of fact but only if it was fair to do based on the evidence. On the issue of cross-examination, Mr Emmerson said the inquiry is an inquisitorial process rather an adversarial one, but that he, as counsel, could still nevertheless explore the credibility of witnesses. In a statement, the peer's lawyer said: \"Lord Janner was an honourable man, entirely innocent and never convicted of any crime.\" The hearing, at the Royal Courts of Justice, was also told the Goddard Inquiry as a whole has so far received disclosure of 35,000 documents and is receiving up to 100 communications from the public each week.",

        "article": "When Marine Le Pen appeared in the Kremlin on 24 March, it was Vladimir Putin himself who gave voice to the thought that was surely on many people's minds: \"I know that the presidential campaign is developing actively in France,\" the Russian president said, adding: \"Of course, we do not want to influence events in any way.\" The Russian president appeared to be suppressing a grin as he spoke those words. Marine Le Pen appeared unperturbed. She repeated her support for Moscow's annexation of Crimea, and her opposition to the sanctions subsequently imposed by the EU. If elected to the Elysee Palace, she pledged: \"I would envisage lifting the sanctions quite quickly.\" So the meeting was a win for both. Madame Le Pen looked like a world-leader-in-waiting; Mr Putin received assurances from a woman who might become president of France, and who, like him, opposes the EU and Nato. But there is more to the relationship between Mr Putin and Ms Le Pen than ideological convergence. Because of the National Front's racist and anti-Semitic past, French banks have declined to lend the party money. So Marine Le Pen has been forced to look elsewhere for financing. In 2014, the National Front took Russian loans worth \u20ac11m (\u00a39.4m). One of the loans, for \u20ac9m, came from a small bank, First Czech Russian Bank, with links to the Kremlin. The loan was brokered by Jean-Luc Schaffhauser, an energy consultant turned MEP, who has called himself \"Mr Mission Impossible\". When I met him in Strasbourg, he told me he initially secured an agreement with a financial institution in Abu Dhabi, but the deal fell through. He even approached a potential lender in Iran, but Marine Le Pen vetoed the idea, he said. Eventually, he went to Russia. The negotiations over the loan coincided with Russia's annexation of Crimea. EU governments condemned the annexation. Marine Le Pen publicly took the opposite view, leading some to question whether the loans were a quid-pro-quo. Mr Schaffhauser denied he and Ms Le Pen ever discussed the issue of Crimea in relation to the loan. \"Always Marine Le Pen, and Jean-Marie before, was for co-operation with Russia,\" he said. \"It was not a political loan.  It was a commercial loan.\" But Russia did want to use Ms Le Pen to legitimise its actions in Crimea. We know this because a group of Russian hackers, known as Shaltai Boltai, or Humpty Dumpty, published a series of text messages said to be between a Kremlin official and a Russian MP. The exchanges, which took place in mid-March 2014, shows the pair discussing the possibility of Marine Le Pen travelling to Crimea as an observer in the referendum which would lead to Crimea's annexation. \"We really need this, I told my boss you were in contact with her,\" the Kremlin official says. Marine Le Pen didn't go to Crimea. Instead she publicly backed the results of the referendum, a fact that delighted the Kremlin official and the MP. \"She didn't let us down,\" says one text, followed by a smiley-face. \"We must find some way of demonstrating our respect to the French,\" comes the reply. Some believe the \u20ac9m loan, which was made later that year, was indeed a reward for Ms Le Pen's support over Crimea. \"For me, there is no doubt that [the loan] was authorised by Kremlin,\" said Mikhail Kasyanov, who was prime minister under Vladimir Putin before he joined the opposition. \"[It was] a special operation, a special recommendation of those businesspeople, to help Marine Le Pen.\" Long read: The story of Marine Le Pen Is Russia really interfering in European states? France's election: Who are the candidates? The Kremlin told me it had nothing to do with the loans, and that Mr Putin and Marine Le Pen had never met before the visit to Moscow in March 2017. Marine Le Pen echoed that. But I heard something different, and from a pretty good source. In February, I met Marine's father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder of the National Front, at his mansion on the outskirts of Paris. On his desk, he showed me a glossy calendar depicting Vladimir Putin in various military poses. \"I see, that's your friend,\" I joked. \"He's not my friend,\" he said, \"I've never met him. But he's met Marine.\" Mr Le Pen was unclear about the exact details of the meeting. But this conversation took place before the public meeting in the Kremlin in March. Jean-Marie Le Pen and his daughter are not on good terms. She expelled him from the National Front in 2015 in an attempt to distance herself from his racist, anti-Semitic reputation. But other people close to Marine Le Pen also told me that she had claimed to have met Mr Putin previously. Somebody is lying. But who? And why? When I asked Jean-Luc Schaffhauser about the earlier meeting he said simply: \"This is a secret. There are little secrets, and this secret.\" Marine Le Pen maintains she has never been influenced by Russian money. But last week it was revealed the National Front had applied for another Russian loan in 2016. Amid fears over Russian interference in elections from Europe to the United States, the mystery of her relationship with Vladimir Putin casts a shadow over her campaign.

Richard Conway, reporting for BBC Sport at the congress, said a concern was raised over those who voted against the tougher racism measures. \"Former South African apartheid prisoner Tokyo Sexwale, now a Fifa member, urged congress to check cameras to see who voted against racism rules,\" he said. \"Sexwale says (the) 1% vote against demonstrates how football still has to fight against racism.\" Webb said of the vote against the measures: \"I would like to think it was a mistake but I'm glad it wasn't the other way. I'm glad only 1% went that way.\" Nonetheless, Fifa president Blatter accepted more must be done to eradicate racism. He said: \"We need zero tolerance and strict punishments everywhere. We must lead. We must set a tough, uncompromising example. \"We can make a difference. We can send a strong signal to the racists that their time is up.\" Fifa commissioned a task force to address the issue of racism after a friendly game between AC Milan and Pro Patria was abandoned due to racist chanting. Their verdict includes putting an official inside the stadium to identify potential acts of racism and ease the pressure on the match referee. The new rulings standardise punishment across the members, meaning federations will lose the power to impose their own judgements. Further to the regulations that relate to clubs or international teams, the new measures will see any individual who commits a racist offence banned from stadiums for a minimum of five matches. The five-match suspension is one that has been introduced by the Football Association, whose chairman David Bernstein sat on the task force in Mauritius. Also on the task force was Kevin-Prince Boateng, the AC Milan player who led the walk-off in the game against Pro Patria in January. Former England international striker Luther Blissett, an ambassador for anti-racism charity Show Racism The Red Card, admitted to reservations about the new measures. \"You've got to applaud them for doing something about it, my thing is when they talk about the 'level' of racism,\" he told Radio 5 live. \"To me, racism is racism. \"Fifa have to let it be known where they are going to start this from. Any form of racism is serious enough for the bans to start, they should hit people hard straight away.\"",

        "article": "Ricardo Santos scored his first Barnet goals as they moved into the League Two play-off places with victory at Leyton Orient. The Portuguese defender's quick-fire brace put the Bees in control at Brisbane Road before Curtis Weston sealed the points in added time after Paul McCallum had halved the deficit. Santos, a recent signing from Peterborough, seized on a fumble by O's goalkeeper Alex Cisak to break the deadlock from close range in the 63rd minute and he doubled the advantage three minutes later following good work from Nana Kyei. McCallum gave the O's a lifeline when he powerfully headed in a Callum Kennedy corner with 10 minutes remaining but Weston guaranteed the three points when he crashed the ball into an empty net after a lob from substitute Jamal Campbell-Ryce rebounded off the crossbar. Although the teams went into the interval all-square, the visitors should have been well ahead having missed five clear chances, and leading scorer John Akinde was the main culprit for their profligacy. His best chance came after just four minutes when he stabbed wide from close range with the goal at his mercy. Fellow striker Simeon Akinola spurned two straight-forward chances set up by Akinde as the home side struggled to contain the Bees' attacking threat. However, an incisive display after the break deservedly earned the visitors their sixth victory in eight matches. Report supplied by the Press Association. Match ends, Leyton Orient 1, Barnet 3.

On the one hand, eurocrats were hurried - in wind and rain - into EU courtyards to stand in photo-op-ready groups to form the number 60. (It's the EU's 60th birthday celebration this Saturday.) And on the other - after months of cajoling, thinly-veiled frustration and angst from Brussels - the UK government finally made clear the date it will officially trigger the Brexit process. Next Wednesday. But whereas Saturday really is a huge deal for the EU - marking decades of togetherness at a time when the union is very much under threat from populist nationalism across the EU, inequality and discord in the eurozone, migration complications and Brexit itself, of course - next Wednesday, while an historic day in the UK, will not play out so big this side of the Channel. There is a determination here that Brexit must no longer be allowed to dominate and overshadow EU politics as it has done since way before the UK referendum even. One high-level source told me that after Brussels received Britain's formal notification of its intention to leave, Brexit would immediately be downgraded to one of many EU issues to be dealt with, rather than The Big Thing. \"There will be no major political apocalyptic show,\" he assured me. But of course, the underlying EU fear remains that if a Brexit deal is too sweet for the UK, other countries may be inspired to also walk out the door. Brussels officials are grateful that Theresa May did not trigger Article 50 this week, so close to the EU's birthday bash. The tone there will be resolutely upbeat, rather than focused on one of its key members leaving the club. As for the what-happens-next with Brexit, the rule in Brussels is: don't expect too much too fast. Ever. The remaining 27 EU leaders, or at least their teams, began getting diaries together on Monday. To fix a date (expected in around five or six weeks) for that all-important summit when they'll agree their red lines and guidelines for Brexit negotiations. The European Commission will lead the UK talks from the EU side - but all the initial meetings will be about who will meet, when, in which country, discussing what and in which order. Most probably little of substance will be achieved before the autumn. The EU prefers to get the key elections coming up in big-hitters France and Germany out the way first. But any delay is painful for the UK. The Article 50 timer is set for two years and the clock starts ticking next Wednesday.",

        "article": "An 83-year-old man has been reunited with a vintage car he drove in the 1950s, after its current owner tracked him down. Bert Davidson, from Hopeman, near Elgin, had not seen his 1929 Humber since he sold it nearly 60 years ago. But a few years ago he was contacted by Robin Wills - whose father had owned the saloon car in the 1960s and 70s - who had tracked it down to America. Mr Wills has since restored the dilapidated car to its former glory. After towing it up to Elgin from his home in Brancepath, County Durham, Mr Davidson once again got a chance to sit behind the wheel. \"I had a run around the block in it. I thoroughly enjoyed the trip,\" Mr Davidson told the BBC News website. \"It was a grand motor car and he's done a magnificent job restoring it. The paintwork is in its original colours. The interior is all original. He tried to get me to drive it - but I said 'I'd better not!'\" Mr Davidson had first come across the car at an old coachbuilders in Elgin while working at his father's garage following his National Service in 1954. It was under a dustsheet and he asked the owner if he could buy it. \"He said 'No laddie, I'm not selling it',\" Mr Davidson said. \"I asked him again eight weeks later. This went on for two years. Eventually he said I could have it and he asked how much I had in my pocket. I got it for \u00c2\u00a315 which was a bargain.\" Mr Davidson restored the car and in 1959 entered it in the Kildrummy Rally, where vehicles travelled from Kildrummy to Aberdeen. He won the vintage class. \"I was the only kilted competitor,\" he said. Eventually, Mr Davidson's father sold his garage and he had nowhere to keep the car so it had to go. \"I sold the car to a man from RAF Kinloss or Lossiemouth for \u00c2\u00a3185,\" Mr Davidson recalled. \"I watched him drive away and put it completely out of my mind. That was the last I saw of it until Robin got in touch 55-60 years later. \"I was very surprised when he got in touch and I am delighted that I'm going to see the car again.\" Mr Wills' father bought the car in about 1965 but sold it to a Newcastle car dealer in 1974, when Mr Wills was aged four. The next time Mr Wills saw it, it was when it appeared in the opening credits of the 1976 Likely Lads film. \"It's unique because it has an owl on the front, on the top of the radiator,\" he said. \"So I knew it was the same car.\" Mr Wills' research, which took two years, revealed that the car was later bought by a man who took it to America and it had crossed the Atlantic four times. It was also owned by the man's brother, Lotus designer Martin Waide. However, after its engine blew up in 1979 it was never driven again until Mr Wills brought it back to its former glory. \"I used to talk to my dad about the car in my teenage years as I had fond memories of it,\" he said. \"I was delighted and astounded to find it. When I got it back the first thing I did was to open the door, shut my eyes and took a whiff. \"It has the original interior. It hasn't been touched in 98 years. The smell was astounding. It was as if I had been transported back to 1974.\" The Humber had some plaques inside it relating to the Kildrummy Rally. Mr Wills carried out an internet search and found footage of the rally, which included Mr Davidson and the car, on the National Library of Scotland's Moving Image Archive. \"I couldn't believe it,\" he said. \"It was as if someone had walked on my grave. It was an incredible experience.\" He then managed to track Mr Davidson down. \"The sense of excitement in his voice was unbelievable,\" Mr Wills said. \"I think he was as excited as I was.\" The two men discovered they had more in common than the Humber - they also shared the same birthday. For Mr Davidson's 80th, Mr Wills sent him the car's original front number plate which the pensioner had made. \"I thought that was great,\" Mr Davidson said. The journey to northern Scotland with the car on Saturday was wet at times, forcing Mr Wills to make an emergency stop to buy brass polish. \"I had to buff up the brasswork. I wanted it to look its best for Bert,\" he said. \"It's been an amazing experience. I feel a bit like Doctor Who, travelling back to meet characters from the past.\" The Humber's owners, past and present, exchanged gifts - a photo album of the car and a bottle of whisky from Mr Davidson's home town of Elgin.",

        "article": "It is 50 years since Action Man, the must-have toy of the 1970s, arrived in the UK. The plastic moulded figures, rebranded from the US GI Joe version, made their debut in the UK at the British Toy Fair in Brighton, in January 1966, after a toy executive realised their market potential. The early toys were imports but Palitoy, based in Coalville, Leicestershire, would go on to make its own version with \"lifelike hair\", \"beards\" and \"gripping hands\" in the early 1970s. According to Rob Burman, editor of the Collectors Gazette, Palitoy bosses gave strict instructions not to call them \"dolls\" as boys could be put off. They were hugely popular, with sales topping 20 million by the end of the 1970s. Modifications kept the toys fresh and collectable, for example \"eagle eyes\" were introduced in 1976 by Hasbro, the US makers, and Palitoy brought in \"flocked\" hair and non-military costumes such as football kits. However, despite a loyal band of collectors, the success did not last into the 1980s. \"The 60s and 70s were the big times for Action Man and then Star Wars came along,\" said Mr Burman. \"Everyone wanted intergalactic characters, they weren't bothered about poor old Action Man.\" The toy expert said the figure made a bit of a comeback in the 1990s but nowadays people are generally more \"politically correct\" and so there is little interest in soldier toys. However, there is still a thirst for the old outfits - a boxed judo costume recently sold for ??6,000 at auction. Chris Malbon, 58, from Nottingham, who runs Warwickshire-based Metropolis Toys, had at one time one of the most \"comprehensive\" Action Man collections in the UK. He started collecting in 1989 and spent thousands on his acquisitions, which he admits got a \"bit out of hand\", and he later he sold them all for a \"substantial\" fee. \"I collected the entire range,\" said the trader. \"Both boxed and loose, together with US, French, German, Spanish, Japanese variations. I guess around 200 figures.\" However, it all became a bit of a burden. He said: \"It's not because of the money... you end up wanting that elusive item or upgrading what you have to the exclusion of other things.\" Mr Malbon, a former soldier himself, did not want to say what he sold his collection for but said it was as much as he paid for his house in the 1990s. Palitoy's former chief toy designer Bob Brechin, who modelled Action Man's gripping hands on his own, said the toy has endured. \"It's hard to believe it has been 50 years,\" he said. \"He's timeless, universal, we never gave Action Man a story, we just gave children [the figures] and the outfits you dress him in and left it to their imaginations.\" Hasbro has announced it is releasing a set of vintage figures as part of the anniversary celebrations. It seems Action Man is not quite ready to leave the battlefield.",

One ex-manager said he was instructed to offer free bets and drinks - in one case it was suggested he could buy lunch for high-spending customers. Other managers we spoke to said they were paid a bonus if they met financial targets on the machines. The industry says it takes responsible gambling very seriously. Fixed Odds Betting Terminals (FOBT) offer simple touch screen play, usually on a version of roulette, where people can gamble as much as \u00a3100 per spin, in theory every 20 seconds. \"John\", who was a manager at Coral until recently, said staff were given instructions to offer machine players refreshments as soon as they entered the shop and do \"absolutely anything\" to make them feel comfortable. \"If the shop was too hot for them, we would have to turn the heating down or vice versa. They were the gods of the betting shop,\" he said. \"There was a suggestion from the area manager at one time that if we had a customer coming in their lunch hour, we had to make sure they didn't waste time trying to get a cheese and ham roll instead of playing the machines. You could go out there, buy them a cheese and ham roll and get it ready for them.\" Coral said it takes its commitments to responsible gambling \"extremely seriously\". It added it had \"strengthened protections for all its customers, providing help and support for the very small minority that may have issues with their gambling activity\". John said managers had to hit their machine profit target and would receive a financial reward if they did. \"I know another firm based their whole wage on how much money they made on machines, so there was every incentive for the staff to encourage people,\" he said. The two store managers, who still work for Coral, said they felt pressure to hit financial targets on the FOBTs machines. One passed on internal emails from Coral's central operations department about a new FOBTs game called Big Banker, which gave advice on \"smashing your targets\". It said: \"Ensure your team has\u2026 identified your target key customers to demonstrate our popular feature game. Offer a demo to all of your machine customers to whet their appetite, then encourage them to play with their own money. \"Once you have identified your target customers, it often helps when you use a 'hook' to encourage them to play. 'You like Big Banker, do you have our bonus card yet? It's quick, it's easy and it's free.'\" Case study: 'Red mist' of gambling Tony Franklin has had a problem with gambling since he was a child. He had managed to stay out of the bookies for a year, but over a couple of hours 18 months ago, he blew it all. Having avoided high-street bookmakers for a year, he cleaned out his bank account in just an hour after a trip to the barbers.  As he left he was drawn to one of the many betting shops on his high street and one of its FOBTs. \"I was totally devastated and just completely caught up in the gambling, in the red mist of it,\" he says. His addiction has had a devastating effect on his personal relationships.  He had been due to bring his wife and child over to the UK to set up home but his expensive relapse put his plans on indefinite hold. Now Tony keeps his betting shop receipts from that day as a reminder of how quickly he can lose control when faced with temptation. He feels the industry should be doing more to stop addicts like him losing control. Under the industry's code of conduct, all staff should be trained to identify and help problem gamblers. But one woman, who works for another unnamed bookmakers, said that did not always happen. \"I have never actually been trained. All we have is a leaflet and are told to give them out if we feel people have a problem. But working on your own at night, or even in the morning, makes it extremely hard to hand out leaflets and speak to customers who are clearly frustrated,\" she said. Malcolm George, from the Association of British Bookmakers, said: \"It is absolutely the case that anyone joining and working in a betting shop will receive training about problem gambling.\" Coral said it rejected the allegations made by the BBC. It added in its statement: \"Recent health surveys show that problem gambling rates have in fact fallen since the introduction of FOBTs and the average Coral customer's loss per session on a FOBT is around \u00a36-9. \"The introduction of supervised stakes above \u00a350 from April last year has had a profound change in customer behaviour, with an approximate 70% reduction in stakes above that level. \"Training, tools and processes are in place throughout the business to ensure that potential problem gamblers are identified and protected.\" The Victoria Derbyshire programme is broadcast on weekdays between 09:00-11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News Channel.",

Media playback is not supported on this device Scarlets led by 14 points after a frantic first half with Aaron Shingler, Jonathan Evans and DTH van der Merwe scoring tries. Hadleigh Parkes' score - following a superb break by Rhys Patchell 30 seconds after the break - clinched the bonus point and the game. Blues could add only a diving Blaine Scully try to Tom James' early score. After losing their first three games of the season, Scarlets overtake the Blues - who have lost their last three - to move into sixth place in the Pro12 table. The absence of 13 first-choice players on Wales international duty did little to detract from the atmosphere and excitement, although some of the defending was less than top-class. A noisy Friday night crowd were whipped up by four tries in the opening 23 minutes. And they really found their voice during a series of re-set scrummages lasting more than seven minutes before the interval, which eventually resulted in props Taufa'ao Filise and Wyn Jones being shown yellow cards. Scarlets held out under intense pressure with the home crowd baying in vain for referee Lloyd Linton to award a penalty try. Their sense of injustice was further fuelled when Patchell, playing at the Arms Park for the first time since leaving Blues for Scarlets, broke from his own half to set up Parkes from the restart. Media playback is not supported on this device The meeting of the Shingler brothers was another sub-text for the fixture and took its own farcical twist when Aaron was shown a yellow card after being tackled without the ball by Steven. Blues eventually claimed a try when Scully scored acrobatically, but in spite of dominating possession and benefitting from a lopsided penalty count, they could not close the gap further.

        "article": "I tipped Chelsea to win the title in August and there was not one moment during the whole season that I did not think they would end up as champions. MOTD2 pundit Alan Shearer looks at the reasons why Jose Mourinho's Chelsea side won the Premier League by such a convincing margin and explains why it will be hard to stop them achieving more success. Every part of their team did their bit but the biggest reason for their success is one man, Jose Mourinho. His influence was huge. Media playback is not supported on this device The Blues manager is a serial winner who lives for titles and trophies - and he knows exactly how to get what he wants. I don't accept the 'boring boring Chelsea' jibes his side have faced recently. I think that is utter rubbish. It is not Chelsea's problem if teams cannot beat them, and it is pretty embarrassing if they then call them boring. The only tag the Blues deserve is 'worthy champions' because that is what they are. Everyone else has a lot of catching up to do. One of the biggest reasons Chelsea won the title is that, unlike his rivals, Mourinho identified what he needed last summer, and went out and got it. I am sure he was hurt by what happened to Chelsea last season, his first back at Stamford Bridge since his last spell ended in 2007. Despite not having a really top-class centre-forward they went very close to winning the title. Near-misses don't mean anything to Mourinho, though. He addressed the main issue holding his side back by signing Diego Costa, who has scored the goals that were missing. Chelsea were also lacking a bit of guile in midfield, and Cesc Fabregas has provided the extra creativity there. His midfield partnership with Nemanja Matic, who Mourinho signed in January 2014 to sit and police the back four, is just one part of a team system that works perfectly. Chelsea have some top players, but their squad also has a great hunger and desire. That is down to their manager. By the end of the season, Chelsea will have broken the record for the most days spent on top of the table, and also the most consecutive days. They were joint-top with Manchester City at the start of January but, since they kicked their first ball of the campaign, the only time they have not been at the summit was after the second round of games. Their players had the character to deal with it. From August onwards, they have been the team to beat and the best team full-stop. That underlines their consistency over the last nine months, and shows the almost total control they have had on the title race. Even when they were hit for five by Tottenham on New Year's Day, no panic set in. That was one of their very few bad days, which are inevitable over a long season, but they never suffered a slump for a sustained period of time. They have never had to play catch-up in the title race and are not used to doing it in individual games either. Again, they are usually in control. They have scored the first goal in 27 out of their 35 league matches, which is obviously important for any team, but especially for Chelsea. When you have a defence like they do, they are very rarely pegged back when they get in front. I keep hearing that players need to be rested and rotated but Chelsea don't do it, and their approach seems to have helped rather than hindered them. Instead, Mourinho uses a core group of players who start whenever they are available. That includes Eden Hazard, who is hardly ever taken off either, something that is rare for an attacking player. At the back, John Terry has been magnificent and he has played every single minute of every league game. Media playback is not supported on this device The rest of the back four - Gary Cahill, Branislav Ivanovic and Cesar Azpilicueta - play whenever they are fit. Compare them to, say, Manchester City who chop and change their defence a lot and you can see the benefit of a settled unit who work relentlessly together. Chelsea have had 17 clean sheets out of 35 league games, and they have only conceded more than two goals twice. They were pretty good at the back in the first half of the season when they were scoring goals freely. Until 17 January, only Southampton had conceded fewer goals. But in the past few weeks when they have been more pragmatic in the way they have been getting results, they have been even better at the back. From August to January, Chelsea played some sparkling football and you only have to look at their attacking statistics to see that they were anything but dull. So they earned the right to play the way they have been in the last few weeks, when they have been protecting their lead at the top of the table. I put that change in approach down to form and fitness of some of their players, with Costa's absence being the obvious example. The important thing was that Chelsea kept winning, though, and they have done that. None of their rivals have managed it over the duration of the season and the way I would sum up this campaign is that Chelsea have been brilliant and the rest of the league has not been good enough - by quite a margin. City, Arsenal, Manchester United and Liverpool have all been disappointing, especially when you look at the money they have spent, because they are further away from Chelsea now than they have been for a while. Chelsea have done the job they set out to do at the start of the season, which is to win the title. They have the best defensive record in the Premier League and only City have scored more goals. They also have the best player, Hazard. Put all of that together and I just cannot accept they are dull. They have not got the credit they deserve but I don't think that bothers Mourinho one iota. Media playback is not supported on this device The only thing that matters to him is winning the Premier League, and he has done that with ease. He has his third title in English football, and now he will want more. He can get that with this Chelsea team, which certainly does not need much work done to it over the summer. I am pretty sure a centre-forward will be high on Mourinho's shopping list because we have seen how much they have missed Costa when he has been out. Also, Didier Drogba is 37 now and I am not sure how long he can keep going. But the main thing for Chelsea is that Mourinho is not going anywhere - while he is around, there are more trophies to come. Alan Shearer was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.",

        "article": "Bangladesh claimed their first Test win over England as the tourists lost 10 wickets for 64 runs after tea on day three of the second Test in Dhaka. Chasing 273, England collapsed from 100-0 to 164 all out, with Mehedi Hasan taking 6-77 and Shakib Al Hasan 4-49. They earlier dismissed the hosts for 296 after dropping four catches. Bangladesh had only beaten Zimbabwe and a weakened West Indies team in 95 previous Tests, but the 108-run win means the series finished 1-1. England needed their highest successful run chase in Asia and looked well set after a century opening partnership between Alastair Cook and Ben Duckett. But they lost all 10 wickets in 22.5 overs in the final session as Bangladesh secured the biggest win in their history. Bangladesh had lost 72 of their previous Tests and last played in August 2015 because of security concerns in the country. Duckett (56) scored his first Test half-century but was bowled by 19-year-old off-spinner Mehedi with the first ball after tea, prompting the stunning collapse - the third worst in history by a team who had been 100 without loss. Joe Root was lbw in the following over to Shakib, before Gary Ballance and Moeen Ali were dismissed in the same Mehedi over shortly afterwards. Cook made 59 but, despite successfully overturning one dismissal, the England captain was caught off Mehedi by Mominul Haque at silly point. Shakib then dismissed Ben Stokes, Adil Rashid and Zafar Ansari in quick succession. Fittingly, Mehedi took the final wicket of Steven Finn to finish with six in the innings, 12 in the match and 19 in the series. Openers Cook and Duckett, who batted together for the first time in the first Test in Chittagong, had only managed a best partnership of 26 in their previous three innings. Duckett, 22, impressed with an aggressive 56, hitting seven fours and a six, and played a number of reverse sweeps and pull shots. Bangladesh bowled all four spinners in the session leading up to tea but they took no wickets in helpful conditions. Cook had scored four, 12 and 14 in the series but also batted fluently in a period that seemed to swing the game in England's favour. England will rue their failure to take early wickets as Bangladesh added 116 runs in the morning session and Cook's side dropped four catches. Imrul Kayes scored 78 but was dropped at leg slip by Cook off Ansari, and then by Root off Moeen in the first 10 overs of the day. Both were difficult catches but Duckett dropped a simple chance at deep mid-wicket later in the session with Shakib the batsman to benefit. Finn also put down a difficult diving chance, while England chose not to review the umpire's decision on two occasions when replays showed the batsman would have been given out had they done so. Kayes' innings and 41 from Shakib helped Bangladesh to 268-7 at lunch, but Stokes (3-52) and Rashid (4-52) helped England knock over the tail in 26 balls after lunch. Media playback is not supported on this device Former England spinner Vic Marks on BBC Test Match Special That was extraordinary. I don't think I've seen a series where it's been impossible to know who's winning. At tea time we were praising Duckett and Cook, but less than two hours later the match was over. I've not seen the mood change between sessions like that before. Ex-England batter Ebony Rainford-Brent I feel emotional for Bangladesh. There were all these issues about security and there were doubts about the series taking place. The people here were all so happy that England came. This is unbelievable. Former Bangladesh all-rounder Athar Ali Khan That was a very special win for Bangladesh. I think 160 million people in Bangladesh will have been glued to the TVs, radios and phones.

The Scot dug deep to claim a 2-6 6-4 7-6 (7-4) victory in a match that lasted two hours 59 minutes. He recovered from two breaks of serve in the third set, his opponent serving for the match at one point. Murray now faces Austria's Dominic Thiem in the last four. Ramos-Vinolas, who is at a career-high world ranking of 19, capitalised on a string of unforced Murray errors to take the first set but was pinned back in the second as the Scot battled back to level. In Monte Carlo, Murray had led 4-0 in the final set before capitulating to a defeat to Ramos-Vinolas. In Barcelona, it was the Spaniard who held a final set lead, winning the first two games before injuring his foot attempting to receive a volleyed return, which led to a lengthy period of treatment. The incident initially benefited Murray, who won the next three games, but Ramos-Vinolas steadied the ship and looked set for victory after breaking in the ninth game. However, Murray dug deep and immediately broke back before taking the match to a tie-break that he largely dominated and clinched on his second match point. \"It was obviously a very tough match,\" said Murray. \"It was kind of the opposite of the match we had last week where probably  today he deserved to win. He created a lot more chances, he served for the match and couldn't quite get it. \"Last week I had 4-0 [in the third set], I felt like I had all of the  chances. Sometimes on clay matches happen this way, so very happy to get through.\" Rafael Nadal, a 10-time winner in Barcelona, joined Murray in the last four courtesy of a 7-6 (7-1) 6-2 win over Korean qualifier Hyeon Chung. The Spanish 14-time Grand Slam champion, 30, takes on Russia's Karen Khachanov or Argentine Horacio Zeballos in the last four. Britain's Aljaz Bedene continued his winning run with a straight-sets win over second seed Ivo Karlovic to reach the Hungarian Open semi-finals. British number four Bedene broke the Croat's serve early in both sets on his way to a 6-4 6-3 victory, and a 15th-straight win. The 27-year-old, ranked outside the top 100 at the beginning of March, has climbed to world number 68. He faces fourth seed Fernando Verdasco or fellow qualifier Laslo Djere next. Bedene came through qualifying in Budapest to reach his first ATP Tour semi-final since January 2016. He also won back-to-back titles on the second-tier ATP Challenger Tour earlier this month.

He said it would be \"hugely challenging\" given current \"strong anti-establishment thinking\". No such poll is taking place, but his comments come after others warned of threats to devolution in Brexit's wake. In response, Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood said the EU result should not be read as a vote to \"centralise\" power. During the referendum campaign Labour, which leads the Welsh Government, and official opposition Plaid Cymru campaigned to stay in the European Union, while Mr Davies campaigned for Leave. Leave won in Wales, and since the June vote First Minister Carwyn Jones has called for any future Brexit deal to be put to Britain's devolved legislatures, saying he would set up an advisory group on the issue. Mr Davies said there was \"no great warmth or affection\" towards the assembly. Speaking to BBC Radio Wales' Sunday Supplement programme, he added: \"This thought came to me when I was having an innocent conversation with a fellow farmer, we were talking about Brexit. \"He posed the question to me that if the referendum for the assembly was re-run today, could it be won? \"If you reflect on it and the state of politics at the moment, I don't think it could be won, to be honest with you. \"The more and more you travel around Wales, and I say this with a heavy heart... sadly people feel very remote from the institution. \"While people indicate in polls they want decisions taken here in Wales, it's not necessarily through the vehicle of the National Assembly.\" Two referendums were held on Welsh devolution. The first, in 1997, established the Assembly with a victory for Yes - 50.3%.% to 49.7% - but on a turnout of 50.1%. The second in 2011, on whether the assembly should have powers to make law in areas it has jurisdiction, was also won with 63.5% of the vote but with a turnout of 35.6%. Plaid's Ms Wood said: \"Brexit provides an opportunity for the nations to take more power and responsibility from the UK. \"The referendum result shows how Westminster rule has left many communities behind. It should in no way be interpreted as a vote to centralise more power in London. \"No self-respecting country should be timid or ashamed of governing itself. It's disheartening to see such a negative attitude from some in Welsh politics.\" A spokesman for the first minister said: \"We have announced our key priorities for a future (Brexit) deal, established a new business confidence fund to help businesses through this uncertain period and we've announced the establishment of a new department in government, alongside a new external EU advisory group. \"We've met with the prime minister, chancellor, Brexit ministers and the agriculture minister - we've brought together all the devolved governments in Cardiff and summoned a special Council for Economic Renewal. We have demanded, and secured some certainty about future funding, though there is still a way to go on that. \"The narrative the Welsh Tories want to develop simply isn't borne out by the facts.\"",

        "article": "Donald Trump winning the US presidency is considered one of the top 10 risks facing the world, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit. The research firm warns he could disrupt the global economy and heighten political and security risks in the US. However, it does not expect Mr Trump to defeat Hillary Clinton who it sees as \"his most likely Democratic contender\". He is rated as riskier than Britain leaving the European Union or an armed clash in the South China Sea. China encountering a \"hard landing\" or sharp economic slowdown and Russia's interventions in Ukraine and Syria preceding a new \"cold war\" are among the events seen as more dangerous. \"Thus far Mr Trump has given very few details of his policies - and these tend to be prone to constant revision,\" the EIU said in its global risk assessment, which looks at impact and probability. The EIU ranking uses a scale of one to 25, with Mr Trump garnering a rating of 12, the same level of risk as \"the rising threat of jihadi terrorism destabilising the global economy\". \"He has been exceptionally hostile towards free trade, including notably Nafta, and has repeatedly labelled China as a 'currency manipulator',\" the EIU said. It warned his strong language directed towards Mexico and China in particular \"could escalate rapidly into a trade war\". Mr Trump has called for a \"big big wall\" to be built on the US-Mexican border, paid for by Mexico, to keep illegal immigrants and drug dealers out of the United States. Why is Donald Trump considered only slightly less of a threat to global security than a new Cold War? Perhaps it is because unlike traditional presidential front-runners the candidate has little or no policy substance to back up his shoot-from-the-hip-style pronouncements. Want details on how the New Yorker would restructure US trade relations with China? Or how he would implement his proposed Muslim immigration ban? Good luck finding out. Mr Trump has been promising to reveal his foreign policy team since mid-February, but the deadline keeps getting extended. A well-developed foreign policy campaign structure would provide not only substance behind Mr Trump's rhetoric, it would also give foreign leaders connections for their questions. So far, however, it seems international affairs and national security experts in the US are more focused on stopping Mr Trump than trying to help him. Until that changes, expect the global alarm bells to continue to sound. On the campaign trail, Mr Trump has advocated killing the families of terrorists and invading Syria to eradicate the so-called Islamic State group and appropriate its oil. \"His militaristic tendencies towards the Middle East and ban on all Muslim travel to the US would be a potent recruitment tool for jihadi groups, increasing their threat both within the region and beyond,\" the EIU added. Critics of Mr Trump have raised similar concerns. However, the businessman is moving closer to clinching the Republican presidential nominee ticket after winning most of the popular vote in primary elections. Mr Trump, who has no prior political experience, has said his supporters would \"riot\" if he was denied the nomination. In the event he does win the nomination and presidency, the EIU forecasts that domestic and foreign policymaking will be undermined. \"Innate hostility within the Republican hierarchy towards Mr Trump, combined with the inevitable virulent Democratic opposition, will see many of his more radical policies blocked in Congress,\" it said.",

        "article": "NHS staff in England have been told that they should no longer help people access gay conversion therapy. The treatment isn't offered on the NHS, but it's understood some staff have occasionally put patients in touch with organisations who provide it. Experts say attempting so-called \"gay cures\" can be \"dangerous\" and \"damaging\". Fourteen organisations, including NHS England, have signed an agreement to stop gay conversion therapy being offered to patients. Although in general, referrals to conversion services are rare - there is evidence that GPs, counsellors and psychotherapists have made them. They will also be providing training for staff to enable them to improve support available to lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) people seeking advice. The agreement, The Memorandum of Understanding on Conversion Therapy in the UK, makes it clear that NHS England, the organisation which has day-to-day responsibility for running the NHS, \"does not endorse or support conversion therapy\" and will make this clear to staff. It essentially means GPs will not be able to refer patients for gay therapy and that no-one employed by the NHS can provide it. Amber Dowell, communications officer at the UK Council for Psychotherapy, told Newsbeat the agreement was \"really important\". \"It's very common for people to have feelings where they might question their sexuality, where they might want to explore the attractions they're feeling. \"We want people to be able to do that in an environment that is safe, supportive and free of judgement.\" There are no official figures for how many people attempt conversion therapy every year, but the Department of Health has acknowledged to Newsbeat it does occasionally happen. Amber suggested that an \"ignorance of the issue of the ethics involved\" rather than staff being \"prejudiced against LGB people\" was to blame for it being offered by the NHS in the past. \"I think, in trying to help people mistakenly, referrals had been made in the past,\" she said. Newsbeat has spoken to people who said they had experienced conversion therapy. Louise from West Yorkshire said she was blackmailed into receiving \"treatment\" for being gay in 2007 by her evangelical church. She later attended group sessions of around 20 women near Liverpool. \"[Most] were married with children. They were there without the knowledge of their partners or their children. \"If I'd been more impressionable I think I could have been really damaged by the process.\" Brad, from Illinois, lives in the West Midlands. He said he was \"scared\" when he first discovered he was gay and \"wanted to do my very best to change it\". He attended group therapy sessions but realised the treatment, which he said encouraged him \"to do more stereotypical masculine things\" wasn't going to change his feelings. \"It's really sad I spent three years of my life trying to do something that was impossible.\" There are some who suggest it works and insist people should be able to try it. Mike Davidson told Newsbeat he \"converted\" with therapy over the course of two years and now provides what he calls \"support\" for people who have \"unwanted same-sex attraction\" in Northern Ireland. He thinks the service should be allowed but he wasn't able to give an accurate estimate of how widely the treatment was available. He told Newsbeat that gay conversion isn't a \"huge industry\" and that the people he works with have decided it is something they want to do. \"By the time they [clients] get to us, they know what we're about and know what they would like to achieve.\" Explaining the process, he said: \"For some people they want to go as far as controlling their behaviour... they do not want to act out on those issues and we would support them.\" He also said that he turns people away who appear to have been pressured into taking therapy and admitted that, even when working with someone who wants to change their sexual feelings, a \"result\" is never guaranteed. The UK Council of Psychotherapy says it intends to expand the agreement to Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland soon.

Shami Chakrabarti's inquiry reported in June that the party was not \"overrun\" by anti-Semitism. Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis said her report's credibility \"lies in tatters\" after she accepted the peerage. A spokesman for Mr Corbyn praised her \"legal and campaigning skills, and the trust that she has gained.\" Ms Chakrabarti said she was \"honoured to accept Jeremy Corbyn's challenge\". The former director of civil liberties group Liberty said it was an \"opportunity to help hold the government to account\". She also said: \"This is a dangerous moment for our country and we share vital human rights values that need defending more than ever before in my lifetime.\" Who is Shami Chakrabarti She was the Labour leader's only nomination as part of David Cameron's resignation honours list. Ms Chakrabarti was appointed to lead an independent inquiry into claims of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party following the suspension of MP Naz Shah and ex-London mayor Ken Livingstone. The review found there was evidence of \"ignorant attitudes\" but said the \"Labour Party is not overrun by anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, or other forms of racism\". In a statement posted on Twitter, the Chief Rabbi said: \"Shami Chakrabarti has a proud record of public service, but in accepting this peerage, the credibility of her report lies in tatters and the Labour Party's stated intention, to unequivocally tackle anti-Semitism, remains woefully unrealised.\" Wes Streeting, Labour MP for Ilford North, said: \"Shami Chakrabarti will bring great experience to Lords. But let's not pretend that a Labour peerage in these circumstances doesn't stink.\" Marie van der Zyl, of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said it was \"beyond disappointing\" that she had been offered a peerage by Labour \"following her so-called independent inquiry\". And a statement from the Campaign Against Anti-Semitism said: \"If anybody still took Shami Chakrabarti's report on anti-Semitism in the Labour Party or Jeremy Corbyn's declared opposition to anti-Semitism seriously, this must be the final straw... \"Having promised to never send anyone to the House of Lords, that is exactly what Jeremy Corbyn has done in return for a clean bill of health.\" But a spokesman for Mr Corbyn said: \"Shami Chakrabarti shares Jeremy's ambition for reform of the House of Lords. \"Her career has been one of public service and human rights advocacy. \"Her legal and campaigning skills, and the trust that she has gained from many ordinary Britons, will be a considerable asset to the House of Lords. \"Brexit will put many hard-fought rights at risk, so it is crucial that those equipped with the right skills are given the opportunity to hold this government to account.\" Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson had called on the party to boycott the honours process amid criticism of David Cameron's use of his resignation list to recognise former Downing Street staff, Conservative donors and Remain campaign officials. Before the official list was published on Thursday, Mr Watson told the Evening Standard: \"Labour cannot legitimise this process by co-operating. Labour requires working peers, as do the other opposition parties, but we cannot allow an outrageous abuse of a prime minister's discretionary power to go unchallenged.\" Several Conservative MPs have expressed reservations about some of the 46 names on the list - which were all approved by a committee independent of government. Tim Loughton tweeted: \"To have your resignation honours list leaked is unfortunate. \"To go ahead with it after such a public outcry about cronyism, chumocracy and bringing whole honours system into disrepute stinks, not least for those on list who actually deserve to be and previous worthy recipients.\" But a former leader of the House of Lords has defended the decision to also create 13 new Conservative peers, saying an unprecedented number of Conservative members of the unelected chamber had retired since 2010, including 13 in the past year. \"150 peers departed since 2010 (43 Tories).

        "article": "Former Ch Supt David Duckenfield faces 95 charges of manslaughter and five other senior figures will be prosecuted over the 1989 Hillsborough disaster. Mr Duckenfield was match commander at the FA Cup semi-final when 96 Liverpool fans were fatally injured in a crush. Ex-South Yorkshire Police (SYP) Ch Insp Sir Norman Bettison, two officers, a solicitor and a Sheffield Wednesday club secretary also face charges. The Prime Minister said it would be a day of \"mixed emotions\" for families. Last year, new inquests into the disaster at the Liverpool v Nottingham Forest match, held at Sheffield Wednesday's ground, concluded the fans had been unlawfully killed. The inquests found that Liverpool supporters were not responsible for the dangerous situation at the Leppings Lane turnstiles. For legal reasons, Mr Duckenfield cannot be charged over the death of the 96th victim, Tony Bland, as he died four years after the disaster, prosecutors said. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) must apply to the High Court to lift an order imposed after he was prosecuted privately in 1999, which must be removed before he can be charged. An application will be made to the High Court in a matter of weeks and a senior judge will make a ruling in due course. The full list of individuals and charges are: The six men charged over Hillsborough Hillsborough: Criminal charges explained The defendants, other than Mr Duckenfield, will appear at Warrington Magistrates' Court on 9 August. No organisation will face corporate charges and no-one from the ambulance service will be charged, said Sue Hemming, head of special crime and counter-terrorism at the CPS. She explained that Sheffield Wednesday is now a \"different company\" and, as it is not a successor organisation, is not criminally liable for any offences that might have been committed in 1989. \u00c2\u00a356.5m cost of Operation Resolve \u00c2\u00a342m cost of IPCC investigation 17,000 lines of inquiry by Operation Resolve 11,000 statements taken by Operation Resolve 190,000 documents reviewed by IPCC investigation 23,000 images reviewed by IPCC investigation The CPS brought charges following referrals from the Operation Resolve investigation into the causes of the disaster and the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) probe. Assistant Commissioner Rob Beckley, from Operation Resolve, said: \"Our inquiry looked at all aspects of the event, including the planning and the preparation for the game, the safety of the stadium and the response by the emergency services.\" The IPCC investigated the conduct of both SYP and West Midlands Police (WMP) in the days and weeks afterwards. Any decision regarding WMP, which was brought in to carry out the original investigation into the conduct of SYP officers, will be made at a later date. Ms Hemming made the announcement of the intended prosecutions to victims' families at a private meeting in Warrington earlier. She said: \"Following our careful review of the evidence, in accordance with the code for Crown prosecutors, I have decided that there is sufficient evidence to charge six individuals with criminal offences. \"Criminal proceedings have now commenced and the defendants have a right to a fair trial.\" Campaigner Trevor Hicks, whose daughters Victoria, 15, and Sarah, 19, died in the disaster, said: \"There will be six people facing criminal charges who might not have done if we hadn't been resilient and all stuck together and fought this long fight. \"There are no winners in this, it doesn't bring anybody back. \"What it does do is send a message about accountability, as we keep saying, that nobody but nobody is above the law; be it the police or anybody else.\" Chairwoman of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, Margaret Aspinall, whose son James, 18, was killed, said: \"This is definitely the start of the end. \"I think everybody needs that, I think we all need peace from Hillsborough but we can never have peace until we've got truth, justice, accountability. \"I think that's the time we'll all have peace.\" Barry Devonside, whose son Christopher, 18, was killed in the disaster, said: \"Everybody applauded when it was announced that the most senior police officer on that particular day will have charges presented to him.\" Evelyn McDonnell Mills, whose brother Peter McDonnell, 21, died, said she was \"really happy\", but sad that her brother who campaigned for years and died during the new inquests never got to see their conclusion. Pete Weatherby QC, who represents 22 of the victims' families, said they had \"always known that accountability is the most difficult objective\". \"They remain keen to see the criminal process properly pursued for those who have been charged and given that, the rights of the defendants should be respected. \"They do however hope that the memories of their loved ones and the integrity of the fans who attended Hillsborough will be respected during the process.\" BBC News profiles of all those who died At Prime Minister's Questions, Theresa May said: \"I know from working closely with the families when I was home secretary that this will be a day of mixed emotions for them.\" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn offered a \"tribute to all of those that spent a great deal of time trying to ensure there was justice for those that died at Hillsborough\". Dr Alan Billings, the South Yorkshire police and crime commissioner, said he hoped the start of criminal proceedings would \"lead to a measure of closure for the family members who have experienced a long and traumatic process\". Sheffield Wednesday said the club had no comment to make. Mr Duckenfield and Mr Denton's legal representative Ian Lewis, from JMW Solicitors, said: \"In light of the decision by the Crown Prosecution Service to commence criminal proceedings against David Duckenfield and Donald Denton, it would be inappropriate for me as their solicitor, or for my clients themselves, to make any comment.\" Mr Metcalf declined to comment.",

He was chairman for 16 years, during which time the club enjoyed an 11-year stint in the Premier League and two Uefa Cup campaigns. \"This is a very sad day for everyone,\" said Brett Warburton, vice-chairman of the Championship club. \"Phil has been a personal friend for more than 30 years. We send our deepest condolences to all Phil's family.\" In November, Gartside handed responsibility for Bolton's takeover negotiations to football finance executive Trevor Birch. Birch has been trying to to find a buyer as owner Eddie Davies wants to sell, with the club \u00a3172.9m in debt. Former Bolton player and assistant manager Phil Brown recalled Gartside taking part in a training session, with a suit on, before the Sherpa Van Trophy final in 1989. \"He just wanted to be part and parcel of a successful club, a successful team,\" Brown, now Southend manager, told BBC Radio 5 live. \"To go from that to become chairman of the club in 1999 and obviously the most successful period the club has ever had, culminating in two great years in Europe... it was just fantastic for Phil and his family. Today is a very, very sad day for the club.\" Former Trotters captain Kevin Davies, who retired last year, said Gartside was \"really ambitious\" for the club. He said: \"Everyone enjoyed the journey. To be around, he was kind and looked to put his arm around the players.\" Davies said people may have differing opinion about Gartside's legacy but said he and former manager Sam Allardyce had certainly changed \"the direction the club was going in\". BBC Sport's Simon Stone: Born in Leigh, Gartside was at the helm for one of the most amazing periods in Bolton's long and colourful history. With Eddie Davies providing the funds and Allardyce the managerial expertise, Gartside helped take Bolton into the Premier League in 2001, to the League Cup final in 2004 and Europe twice in three seasons after that. A sixth-place finish in 2004-05 - with a squad that included Jay-Jay Okocha, Ivan Campo and Fernando Hierro - was an incredible effort for a club that could not rely on crowds of 25,000 even when things were going that well. Allardyce's resignation in 2007 proved to be the beginning of the end of the good times for Bolton. Though they retained top-flight status for another four seasons, reaching the FA Cup semi-finals in 2011, they never finished in the top half again. By 2012, they had gone down, relegated at the end of a desperate season. Allardyce's replacement, Sammy Lee, lasted 14 games. Gary Megson and Owen Coyle could not halt the slide. Dougie Freedman could not secure a play-off berth in Bolton's first season as a Championship club and was replaced by Neil Lennon in October 2014. Despite Davies agreeing to write off the club's debts as he looks for a way out, Bolton's financial situation has been described by Birch as \"critical\". That is the legacy Gartside has left. Sadly for him, it will be some time before Bolton fans can look past the current mess and remember the glorious nights against Bayern Munich and Atletico Madrid that he helped create. Had Gartside got his way, British football could have looked very different. He was a Premier League representative on the Football Association executive board in 2009, when he put forward a proposal for Celtic and Rangers to be allowed to join the English league. The plan was to form a 'Premier League Two' as a buffer for clubs - such as Bolton - who were unable to retain their top-flight status. It was never formally discussed because of opposition from Uefa and many other Premier League clubs.",

        "article": "China has for the first time admitted in public that it permits trade in skins from captive tigers, according to participants and officials at a meeting of an international convention to protect endangered species. They said the Chinese authorities had never before reported this to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (Cites). However, during the convention's standing committee meeting in Geneva, China reportedly said that it still banned tiger bones. \"A Chinese delegate said, 'we don't ban trade in tiger skins but we do ban trade in tiger bones,'\" a participant in the meeting said. Cites secretariat sources confirmed that a member of the Chinese delegation had said this. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang told the BBC Chinese Service he could not verify the reported admission, but he said that China will \"investigate and combat\" any illegal trade in tiger skins. Between 5,000 and 6,000 tigers are believed to be in captivity in China. Wildlife conservation organisations have long demanded an end to the trade in skins. Wildlife experts believe \"tiger farming\" in China has fuelled demand for the poaching and trafficking of the endangered species elsewhere. They say the admission at the meeting will increase pressure on China to curb the practice. Reports also say that the facilities where the captive tigers are held have been providing live animals and parts for illegal international trade. According to officials and participants at the Cites meeting, the admission from China followed the presentation of a report which gave details of how the Chinese government had allowed commercial trade in skins from captive tigers. \"The report presented in the meeting created a situation that required China to respond,\" said a participant who did not wish to be named. \"Basically when the meeting focused on the findings of this report, the Chinese delegate intervened,\" he said. \"It was the first time they admitted officially that this trade exists in China.\" Participants say this created quite a sensation during the Cites meeting. \"After the Chinese intervention... we too intervened and made it clear that the investigations we have done with other organisations clearly show that the trade in China is happening on a commercial scale,\" said Shruti Suresh, a wildlife campaigner with the UK-based Environment Investigation Agency, which has investigated the illegal wildlife trade across the globe. \"The clarification was necessary because the Chinese delegate did not say that it was happening on a commercial scale, and there was a risk that the trade could later be misreported as something done for scientific research or, say, displays in the museums.\" Member countries of the Cites are required to report on what progress they have made to ensure that trade in specimens of wild animals and plants does not threaten their survival. A new report on illegal wildlife trade suggests that around 1,600 tigers, both from captivity and the wild, have been traded globally since 2000. While China has been a major market for tiger parts, wildlife experts say other South East Asian countries like Vietnam, Thailand, Lao, Cambodia, Malaysia and Indonesia are also emerging as consumers, where tiger farming is growing. Reports say that in the past two years, there have been seizures of nearly 90 tigers likely to have been sourced from, or trafficked through, captive facilities across South East Asia and China. \"Demand-reduction efforts and enforcement and anti-trafficking activities are undermined both by the existence of facilities that keep and breed tigers for commercial purposes, and the lack of enforcement to stop trade from or through them,\" says a report by Species Survival Network (SSN), whose members include more than 100 wildlife conservation organisations. \"Trade in these specimens perpetuated the desirability of tiger parts and China's experiment in licensing the domestic trade in skins of captive tigers has done nothing to alleviate pressure on wild tigers, as evidenced through continued poaching in the wild.\" A little more than 3,000 tigers are believed to be left in the wild across the globe. More than half of those are in India, where 42 tigers were killed last year. \"If the Chinese government has admitted the trade in tiger skins, I think it is a forward step toward curbing illegal trade in tiger parts,\" said SP Yadav, deputy inspector general of India's National Tiger Conservation Authority. \"Denial mode does not help solve the problem but once you accept what is happening, it's easy to move ahead.\" The SSN report says the skins of tigers, leopards and snow leopards are valued among the political, military and business elite as luxury home decorations in China. \"The outcome of recent corruption cases in China confirm they are 'gifted' as non-financial bribes to officials,\" the report says. In 2005, China had announced that it was considering re-opening the domestic trade in tiger bone from tiger breeding facilities. Two years later, Cites parties adopted a decision calling for the phasing out of such facilities.",

In a speech, Ian Murray said the party could take inspiration from dominant figures such as John Smith, Donald Dewar and Gordon Brown. However, Mr Murray added that a new generation must now be responsible for safeguarding the party's future. Party members are set to vote for new leaders at Holyrood and Westminster. The Shadow Scottish Secretary has given his backing to Scottish leadership contender Kezia Dugdale, ahead of her MSP rival Ken Macintosh. He is also backing Yvette Cooper to become the next Labour Party leader. In his speech at Morningside Parish Church in Edinburgh, he said: \"Our lowest points can be the catalyst for our greatest victories. \"We will elect a new leader in a matter of weeks and the hard work will begin. \"A fresh team, a fresh approach, a new generation. I'll play my part in whatever way I can. \"A party which takes inspiration from those who went before - Smith, Dewar, McConnell, Brown. All of them made their own unique and lasting contribution to our party and to our country. \"But the Scottish Labour Party can no longer turn to the big beasts. It falls to a new generation to take the Scottish Labour Party forward.\" For many years, Scottish Labour figures played a dominant role on the UK political stage and in government. Gordon Brown, Alistair Darling, John Reid, the list goes on. But these figures have since stepped down from frontline politics, while the party has fallen out of favour with voters. Today, Labour supporters gathered at Edinburgh's Morningside Church - where former Labour leader John Smith's funeral was held 21 years ago - not to dwell on the past, but to look forward. Speaking at the event, Ian Murray - now Scotland's only Labour MP - told them that while the legacy of these \"big beasts\" should serve to inspire, the party must now turn to a new generation of party talent. His comments were, in part, a nod to one of the youthful audience members, Kezia Dugdale, who Mr Murray has backed to become Scottish Labour's new leader over Ken Macintosh, an MSP since 1999. At the same time, he also gave his support to Yvette Cooper for the UK Labour leadership at a time when veteran MP Jeremy Corbyn is seen by some as a favourite to get the gig. Ian Murray and his Labour colleagues are all too aware of the challenge ahead, and with polls indicating victory for the SNP in the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, the party knows it will have to work extra hard to win back the trust of voters. Mr Murray added: \"I want us to look back 20 years from now, in government in the UK and in Scotland, and be able to say that when the burden of responsibility passed to the next generation we were up to the challenge. \"This will be the work of the new generation. It has to be the work of the new generation because we cannot go back.\" Mr Murray was the only Labour candidate to win in Scotland at May's election, when the SNP took 56 of the 59 seats.

        "article": "A major provider of the NHS non-emergency telephone service in England is seeking to pull out of its contracts due to financial problems. NHS Direct initially won 11 of the 46 regional contracts for the service, covering 34% of the population. It has already pulled out of two services, but now says the remaining nine are \"financially unsustainable\". The whole 111 service has been plagued with problems. NHS bosses have said there is no room for complacency. The service is run by different organisations in each area, including private companies, ambulance trusts and NHS Direct - which ran the old telephone advice line. Discussions are already taking place with other providers, particularly the ambulance trusts, to see who could take over from NHS Direct. NHS Direct announced in June that it was pulling out of two areas - Cornwall and North Essex - even before the services were launched. And earlier this month, it warned that the volume of calls at two of its larger contracts, North West and West Midlands, were 30-40% lower than contracted  leading to lower income and leaving its whole 111 service \"financially unsustainable\". NHS Direct used to be paid more than \u00a320 per call when it ran the old 0845 number. The payment is between \u00a37 and \u00a39 per call for the new 111 service. Projections reported earlier this month showed NHS Direct had lost \u00a32.8m since April and was \"heading for a deficit of \u00a326m if we continue to run the same volume of 111 services until the end of this financial year\". The organisation is now seeking a \"managed transfer\" of its 111 contracts, which have between two and five years left to run, to another provider. NHS Direct has already pulled out of contracts for 111 services in Cornwall and North Essex Nick Chapman, the chief executive of NHS Direct, said: \"We will continue to provide a safe and reliable NHS 111 service to our patients until alternative arrangements can be made by commissioners. \"Whatever the outcome of the discussions on the future, patients will remain the central focus of our efforts, together with protecting our staff who work on NHS 111 to ensure that the service will continue to benefit from their skills and experience.\" The health minister Lord Howe accused NHS Direct of \"losing control of the ball\" and said the majority of the country was getting a good service. \"Their problem, I'm afraid, is that they got their sums wrong, which is very disappointing,\" he added. The whole 111 service was meant to be up and running in April. However, many areas were not ready and only half of services were operational by May. Some parts of England will not have an operational 111 service until 2014. There have also been problems with reports of callers not being able to get through and calls being inappropriately referred, leading to an extra strain on ambulances and hospitals. Dame Barbara Hakin, the deputy chief executive of NHS England, told the BBC: \"We've been in discussions with other providers, particularly the ambulance trusts who, with their experience, will be able to, in a properly managed fashion, take over this service from NHS Direct. \"I'm not going to pretend for one minute that we haven't had very significant problems with 111, which we need to deal with, but it's a really great service with potential.\" Meanwhile, a Channel 4 undercover investigation at another 111 provider, Harmoni, has reported staff shortages, long waits for callers and some cases of ambulances being called out unnecessarily. The Dispatches programme, which will air on Monday night, reports one call centre manager saying the service was \"unsafe\" at weekends because there were too few staff to deal with the calls coming in. A spokesperson for the Prime Minister said the government was not shying away from problems with 111 and it was \"confident that it will continue to push up standards for patients across the country\". It has been an embarrassing start for the 111 phone line. MPs labelled the April launch \"premature\", some services will start around a year late and doctors describe 111 as an \"abject disaster\". There have been reports of long waits and question marks around the decisions made by telephone operators. The Prime Minister and NHS England admit there have been problems introducing the service. However, NHS 111 is here to stay. The immediate challenge will be to find someone to take over the nine regional contracts run by NHS Direct. Ambulance trusts look the most likely to run those services. NHS bosses say callers should not notice any difference in care while the transition is made. Q&A: NHS 111 Shadow health secretary, Andy Burnham, said it was a \"mess of the government's making\" which had led to nurses being replaced by computers. \"The government urgently has to step in both in the short term, to ensure the continuity of the service, but secondly, to get more clinicians back in the front line handling calls -because this computer approach just I'm afraid isn't working, and won't relieve pressure on ambulance services and A&Es.\" Dr Chaand Nagpaul, from the British Medical Association, said 111 had been an \"abject failure\". \"The decision by NHS Direct to seek a withdrawal from its contracts to provide NHS 111 reveals worrying flaws not just with the tendering process for NHS 111 contracts, but for how contracts are awarded and monitored throughout the NHS.\" He said if the service was to recover it needed to be properly funded and closely integrated with local NHS services. Dr Nagpaul added: \"The government must review its competitive tendering approach and instead look towards an integrated model based on cooperation between local services.\"",

Pompey, unchanged for a fourth successive game, looked the more likely to score throughout, Gary Roberts the first to put pressure on the Pools goal as he won the ball on the touchline before dragging wide on the edge of the box.

Now without a win in 12 league matches on home soil - a run that dates back to March - the Dons twice held a two-goal lead before Taylor rescued an unlikely point for Rovers. Dean Bowditch opened the scoring for the hosts after 16 minutes from close range when goalkeeper Kelle Roos spilt a 20-yard strike from Ben Reeves.

Bowditch headed inches wide on the half hour as the hosts went close to making it 3-0. Taylor threw Rovers a lifeline just 66 seconds after the break with a superb right-foot strike from 20 yards. Dons' nerves eased again when Reeves cut inside in the 66th minute to restore the two-goal gap.

Labour argues that Kettering General Hospital could lose services, but this has been rejected by the Conservatives, Liberal Democrats and UKIP. In Parliament, David Cameron said Labour was not telling the truth. The NHS has told the BBC the hospital will not be downgraded. An NHS consultation has started into the organisation of five hospital and clinical commissioning groups, in Northamptonshire, Milton Keynes and Bedfordshire. The hospitals included in the review are Kettering - which is used by people living in Corby - Northampton, Milton Keynes, Luton and Dunstable, and Bedford. The review looks at the option of providing \"specialist centres for some services where this will improve quality\". At Prime Minister's Questions, Conservative MP for North West Leicestershire Andrew Bridgen asked the prime minister about concerns that Labour was running a negative campaign over the future of Kettering hospital. Mr Cameron said: \"Labour MP after Labour MP is trouping up to Corby and claiming this hospital is not safe and they know this is simply not true. \"This hospital is being invested in by this government, unlike the party opposite.\" On a visit to the constituency on Tuesday to support Labour candidate Andy Sawford, shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: \"You clearly can't believe a word the Tories say on the NHS. \"Here in Corby and East Northamptonshire, ministers have failed to provide all the details about plans to downgrade services at Kettering. \"Local people should be given all the facts.\" The United Kingdom Independence Party candidate Margot Parker said: \"I live in the constituency. I live next to a nurse. I speak to local people. We know there is no truth in this at all. \"It is political football of the worst kind. It is a shabby load of nonsense and scaremongering.\" Jill Hope, who is standing for the Lib Dems, has described the claims as \"totally irresponsible\", while Tory candidate Christine Emmett has said she has received assurances about the future of the hospital. The by-election was sparked by the resignation in August of sitting Conservative MP Louise Mensch. Mrs Mensch, who won the seat at the 2010 general election, announced she was standing down for family reasons. A date has yet to be set, but the by-election will almost certainly be on 15 November to tie in with the police and crime commissioner elections.",

Speaking on BBC Radio 4's World At One programme, General Lord Dannatt said it was wrong to \"talk up\" the incidents. Five Afghan soldiers died in an assault on the former UK base Camp Bastion and capital city Kabul has been attacked. Lord Dannatt said the Afghan government must retain the support of the West. The last UK combat troops left Afghanistan in October, with Camp Bastion in Helmand Province being handed over to local armed forces. But there has been a surge in insurgent attacks over the past month, targeting Afghan forces, foreigners and civilians. It has raised concerns about whether Afghan security forces will be able to protect the country when the bulk of the other foreign troops depart this month. Three South Africans were killed in a Taliban attack on a compound used by a US-based charity on Saturday in Kabul, the third such incident on foreigners in 10 days. Ahead of a conference this week on Afghanistan's future in London, Lord Dannatt said: \"It is important the new government shows it has competence and confidence to govern... it is absolutely critical to show international determination to go on financing and supporting the developing Afghanistan.\" He said: \"The security situation is an important element in this but don't let's fall into the trap of playing the Taliban's game and talking up the number of attacks... \"Of course there are going to be attacks... a low level, even a medium level degree of insecurity and a continuing insurgency is quite likely, but let's keep the wider picture in mind.\" The Ministry of Defence said Afghan security forces are providing effective security and the recent incidents do not represent the situation across the country. Lord Dannatt's predecessor, General Sir Mike Jackson, has reiterated his view that the UK withdrew from Afghanistan too soon. Interviewed on the BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said: \"The war, conflict, call it what you will, wasn't over. I'm left feeling there was no victory despite what the politicians say.\" But he said that while the recent attacks were \"somewhat depressing... I don't see certainly at the moment, and I hope never, that the Taliban will be in a position where they can overthrow the elected government of Afghanistan\". He said \"great effort\" has been put into training and mentoring the Afghan security forces. Sir Mike, who led the Army between 2003 and 2006 at the height of the UK's involvement in Afghanistan, added: \"Afghanistan is not a military problem per se, the root of it is political. It seems to me there can only be, in the longer term, a political outcome.\"",

        "article": "Carlos Brathwaite hit the first four balls of the final over for six as West Indies stunned England to win the World Twenty20. West Indies, who were 11-3 in pursuit of England's 155-9, needed 19 off the final over to win and did it in style. Marlon Samuels' 85 not out kept them in contention before Brathwaite's match-winning blitz off Ben Stokes. Joe Root scored 54 for England but nothing could stop the Windies joining their women as World T20 champions. In the process, the West Indies also became the first two-time winners of the men's World Twenty20. Despite the devastating loss, England can take a lot of encouragement from their performance in this tournament, which has showcased an attacking philosophy and resilience that was completely lacking during their group-stage exit of last year's 50-over World Cup. But for Brathwaite and Samuels, it would have been Eoin Morgan's side capping their rapid improvement with their own World T20 title. Brathwaite came in at number eight, joining Samuels at the crease in the 16th over with the West Indies on 107-6 and needing 49 from 27 balls. The tall bowler had only batted twice in the competition prior to the final, scoring 10 not out against South Africa and 13 against Afghanistan in the group stages. But, with 19 needed off Stokes' last over, he seized his moment with the bat in spectacular fashion. Brathwaite will take the headlines, but man of the match Samuels was the real architect behind the West Indies' victory courtesy of his 66-ball unbeaten 85 - the highest individual score in a World T20 final, beating his own record of 78, scored in 2012. He was brought to the crease in just the second over following the dismissal of Johnson Charles, who, along with fellow opener Chris Gayle, was one of two wickets claimed by surprise opening bowler Root. Lendl Simmons, who scored a match-winning 82 in the semi-final against India in his first appearance in the competition, was trapped lbw by David Willey in the next over to leave the West Indies reeling. Samuels was given a reprieve in the first over after the powerplay as replays of his edge from Plunkett showed it fell just short of Jos Buttler's gloves, leading to the umpire calling him back to the crease after initially raising his finger. But Samuels kept a cool head after this, scoring at around a run a ball to reach 50 and help his side to 86-3 before accelerating with two sixes and a four in a key 15th over from Plunkett. Two wickets in the 16th over by Willey in the following over swung the game back England's way, but Samuels remained to watch on from the non-striker's end as Brathwaite turned the game decisively in the West Indies' favour. It was a cruel end to the game for Stokes, who had excelled in the field, taking four catches. He left the field in tears. England also got off to a horror start in their innings, with Jason Roy bowled through the gate from just the second ball of Samuel Badree's opening over. Alex Hales (1) and captain Eoin Morgan (5) followed soon after as they faltered to 23-3. This united England's best two batsmen at the crease with plenty of overs to attack and Joe Root and Jos Buttler steadied the ship before taking the game to their opponent to forge the best partnership of the innings - 61 from just under seven overs. However, Buttler fell just as he was looking to accelerate and Root was dismissed with just over five overs remaining as the pressure on his shoulders produced the first false shot of his innings - a mistimed, premeditated attempted scoop that gave a catch to short fine-leg Benn and Brathwaite the second of his three wickets. Only Willey would make another notable contribution, hitting two sixes and a four in a quick-fire 21 to help England to their modest and ultimately insufficient total. England captain Eoin Morgan: \"It was filled with ups and downs. We let ourselves down with the bat and probably fell about 40 short. \"The decision to open the bowling with Joe Root came about in the last couple of days and golden arm took two wickets in his first over. \"Throughout this tournament we have shared a lot of good times but we are all in pain tonight. Ben [Stokes] plays all three formats, it will take him a while to come back but I have no doubts he will have a long career and do well in an England shirt.\" West Indies captain Darren Sammy: \"This win is something we are going to cherish for a long time. We have 15 match-winners but nobody gave us a chance. \"We felt disrespected by our board, [commentator] Mark Nicholas described us as having no brains and all this brought us together. The ability to put adversity aside and to play this type of cricket is just tremendous.\" England head coach Trevor Bayliss: \"If you add up the white-ball cricket games these guys have played, it's a long way behind other teams. It's a promising side and the signs are good. \"Whatever words I come up with the in the dressing room won't be enough. They're hurting, but it will steel them for the future. \"We have still got work to do, but we have a lot of good players to work with. England cricket is in good hands.\" BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew: \"Four successive sixes to win, I have never seen that before. England looked absolutely crushed. It's really good to see a smile on the face of West Indies cricket. It's a unique brand of the game and it needs to be nurtured and encouraged.\" Former England spinner Vic Marks: \"It was a staggeringly good final and a very good tournament. I feel desperately sorry for England who played so tenaciously to get back into the match, and especially for Ben Stokes. On the other hand you have to admire Brathwaite and the way he finished the game.\" BBC Test Match Special commentator Charles Dagnall: \"An incredible tournament with an impossible end... Love T20. But feel for Stokes, like the penalty taker who misses in sudden death.\"",

The Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) Scotland said the party could generate between \u00a31.1bn and \u00a31.2bn by 2020/21. SNP income tax plans would raise \u00a3300m and the Scottish Conservatives zero. Scottish Lib Dem tax pledges could result in added revenue of \u00a3750m and the Scottish Greens of up to \u00a3950m. New finance powers - including setting the rates and bands of income tax on non-savings and non-dividend income - are heading to Scotland in April 2017. Each of the five Holyrood parties have been outlining their tax and spend plans ahead of the Scottish Parliament election on 5 May. The SNP has pledged to freeze tax rates, and will not implement UK government changes to the threshold at which people start paying the 40% tax rate. It has also promised to raise the personal allowance to \u00a312,750 by 2020/21 by setting a zero rate - a move which the IPPR says will cost \u00a3130m a year. \u00a31.2bn Labour \u00a3300m SNP \u00a3750m Lib Dems \u00a30 Conservatives \u00a3950m Greens Scottish Labour and the Liberal Democrats want to increase income tax by 1p, while Labour would also raise the additional rate for top earners to 50p. The Tories have pledged to match UK government tax plans and therefore will raise no additional revenue, the IPPR said. The Greens have announced plans to create new tax bands and increase the additional rate to 60%. In March, the think-tank calculated the next Scottish government would face a \u00a32bn annual spending gap by 2020. Its latest research compares tax proposals already announced by the parties to what would be raised if they followed UK tax plans, assuming the UK government raises the higher rate threshold to \u00a350,000 by 2020/21 as planned. Russell Gunson, director of IPPR Scotland, said: \"Our analysis is the first time we've been able to show how much each of the parties are seeking to raise in additional tax revenue. \"With billions of pounds of spending cuts and benefits coming to Scotland over the next few years, the balance of tax rises and spending cuts proposed by the parties needs to be front and centre of the plans they will take to the country to vote on next month. \"Ahead of manifestos being published over the course of this month, the parties need to be clear with voters as to how much, if any, tax they hope to raise - and what scale of public spending cuts and reform of our public services they're proposing.\" Scottish Labour public services spokeswoman Jackie Baillie said: \"This expert intervention shows that only Labour has a credible plan to use the powers to stop the cuts to schools and public services. \"The SNP's refusal to tax the richest will see the poorest lose out.\" SNP Finance Secretary John Swinney said: \"This report shows that it is only the SNP that are putting forward balanced, reasonable and fair tax proposals that will support public services like our NHS whilst protecting households budgets.\" He added that it showed \"Labour's plans are a tax grab on some of the least well off in our society\", while the Tories \"are continuing to hand out tax breaks to the rich at the same time as they are cutting public services\". Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said the report showed its tax plans are \"progressive\", while Scottish Greens co-convener Patrick Harvie said it demonstrated its proposals are \"far bolder than the SNP's\", and tackle inequality, \"while Labour's do not\".",

Bakewell man Stephen Downing was convicted in 1974 for killing Wendy Sewell but that was overturned in 2002. Chris Clark said he has uncovered a crucial pathology report showing she was strangled, which was never told to the jury. The Home Office said it would send any new criminal evidence to the police. Evidence of police misconduct would be referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission, the Home Office added. Derbyshire police said the case was closed after a reinvestigation in 2002. Mr Clark, a retired Norfolk police officer, said he has sent his findings to the Home Office after obtaining the original pathology report last month. He said he believed the report showed Mrs Sewell had clear signs of being strangled. She was found battered in a Bakewell cemetery in 1973 and died in hospital two days later. Mr Downing admitted beating her with a pickaxe handle but later retracted that statement, only to be found guilty by a jury. \"I'm reporting the facts as I see them. The pathologist had evidence in his report that could have exonerated Stephen Downing,\" Mr Clark said. He said the pathologist's report showed bruising on her neck consistent with a \"knotted ligature\" used to garrotte her and a rash in her lungs and airways, possibly caused by strangulation. Mr Clark said none of this was used in Mr Downing's trial. He added the evidence may mean her death was linked to the Yorkshire Ripper, Peter Sutcliffe. Mr Downing was 17 at the time of Mrs Sewell's murder but was assessed as having a mental age of 11. His father Ray Downing and Matlock Mercury editor Don Hale campaigned for his release and in 2002 the Court of Appeal found his conviction unsafe because of \"procedural reasons\". Mr Hale said the pathology report directly conflicted with the evidence the police presented at the time and called for an independent investigation into the murder. \"This information was available within two or three days of Mr Downing being arrested and it completely contradicts this so-called confession,\" he said. But Derbyshire police said the murder was reinvestigated following the quashing of the conviction and it considered the matter closed. \"All possible lines of inquiry were exhausted during the re-investigation.  Twenty two people were ruled out of the enquiry but officers were unable to eliminate Stephen Downing as a suspect,\" a spokeswoman said. She added there was no evidence to suggest Peter Sutcliffe - the Yorkshire Ripper - was involved.",

It was launched this week in the UK, but immediately attracted criticism for carrying video of hunters with dead lions and other animals. Mr Kroenke owns the company behind MOTV. It is a small part of his huge Colorado-based sporting empire, Kroenke Sports & Entertainment, which runs TV stations including The Outdoor Channel and World Fishing Network. The range of programmes is not available in every country, partly for reasons of ownership rights, but also in some cases because of local tastes. Its website illustrates this, pointing out that some TV shows that are popular with members in the US may not be desirable to members in the Canada, even though they are both English-speaking regions. The company said: \"There has been significant public attention to a small portion of programming on our MyOutdoorTV app that contains content associated with hunting certain big game animals,\" said Jim Liberatore, the chief executive of Outdoor Sportsman Group. \"Stan Kroenke has directed us to remove all content related to those animals in light of the public interest,\" he said in a statement. Hunting TV app sparks protests The company was keen to underline that it operates independently from Arsenal Football Club. \"Arsenal Football Club has nothing to do with any of our media outlets. It has nothing to do with our content or the editorial decisions we make,\" the statement said. \"We deserve no credit when an Arsenal striker scores a goal. Arsenal deserves no criticism when we offer a program with which some disagree.\" Leader of the Labour opposition and local MP, Jeremy Corbyn, said he was \"disgusted\" by the channel: \"As an Arsenal fan I'm disgusted that Stan Kroenke is involved in such a brutal, unethical and unnecessary activity.\" Robert Peston, ITV's political editor and one of Arsenal's best know fans, expressed his disgust about Mr Kroenke's connection to the channel. In a tweet earlier this week he said: \"I feel sick I have to pay money to this person.\" Philippa King, from the League Against Cruel Sports, welcomed today's move: \"Launching a TV channel which glorifies bloodsports was never going to be a good idea in a nation of animal lovers. We  asked Mr Kroenke to cancel his plan to show trophy hunting and that's what he has done, so we thank him for it. \"Whether the decision was taken because his eyes were opened to the suffering of animals involved in trophy hunting, or because he realised it was a PR disaster for Arsenal football club, I don't know.

        "article": "North Wales needs more devolution if it is to fully benefit from the \"northern powerhouse,\" Manchester city council's leader has said. Sir Richard Leese is a senior figure in the drive to unite the north of England as an economic force. North Wales could benefit from better transport links and growth potential and the Welsh government had been supporting the development, he said. But Sir Richard also said the region \"needed more freedom\". \"Devolution to Wales has to go beyond the Welsh assembly,\" he told the BBC's Wales At Work programme. \"I'd argue Cardiff and its city region ought to be able to do some of the things we're doing in Greater Manchester. \"North Wales again needs to be given more power by the Welsh assembly to enable it to work better with us in the north of England.\" \"From the discussions I've had in north Wales, the growth potential is enormous but it's more likely to be realised if we can work out those synergies between what's happening in north Wales and just the other side of the border. \"They need to be given the freedom by the Welsh assembly to do that.\" The cities of the \"Northern Powerhouse\" stretch from Manchester and Liverpool to Sheffield, Leeds and Hull and up to Newcastle and Sunderland in the north east. Radical improvements to transport connections over the next 15 to 20 years could create a single labour market and \"virtual city\" of 15 million in the north of England, which could provide an economic counter-balance to London. Sir Richard, who is also chair of the Core Cities cabinet which includes Cardiff, said north Wales could also benefit from that and there was a recognition in Cardiff Bay that the links between north Wales and northern England were more important than those with south Wales. Sir Richard said energy production, advanced manufacturing and health innovation and digital industries were not just based in the urban cores and some of these sectors already existed in north Wales. \"North Wales has the opportunity to play into and contribute to those sectoral strengths of the north of England. \"For industry in north Wales its route to market is through the North of England. So what we're do to improve transport connections, there's a shared interest in extending that beyond the north of England.\" He said care had to be taken with comparisons, as Wales had the same population as Greater Manchester but he said areas like transport and business support might benefit from greater devolution within Wales. Tracy North, chair of the CBI in north Wales said company owners and managers wanted to be involved with the Northern Powerhouse but there was not an obvious body or mechanism for doing so. \"The CBI wants the next Welsh government to create a regional development corporation for north Wales,\" she said. \"It would need to be set up immediately after the election. It would have funding and staff, run in partnership with business and be unencumbered by local red tape. \"This way, the north Wales region can act independently to optimise economic opportunities, without going through the impracticality of discussing and voting on devolution, which would out of necessity take years and years.\" A Wales Office spokesman said it was committed to delivering a fundamental shift of power from Westminster to the people and communities of this country and wanted the Welsh government to \"have the same confidence and faith in Wales\". \"Only by giving local areas the powers and freedom they need can we further drive economic growth and create the jobs and investment opportunities this country needs,\" he said. The Welsh government said: \"As part of the Mersey Dee Alliance, we already recognise the economic importance of cross border working and links. We will work with the UK Government to ensure north Wales has full potential to exploit the maximum economic advantage from any Northern Powerhouse proposals.\"",

A first half dominated by the forwards ended with the hosts taking an 8-4 lead thanks to Carlos Tuimavave's late try. But, within a minute of the restart, the French side led when Richie Myler scored after a flowing move from deep. Liam Watts pounced to touch down to put the Black and Whites ahead again, but Walsh kicked Catalans to victory. With both sides triumphant in their opening matches of the season, the victors were guaranteed to be early pacesetters after two games. However, neither team played like leaders in a dour first period. Catalans edged ahead 4-2 through two Walsh penalties, but the hosts led by four points when Tuimavave touched down following a fine burst by the outstanding Sika Manu. Within 60 seconds of the restart the lead changed again as Australian forward Greg Bird combined with Thomas Bosc to tee up Myler for his second try of the season. Watts then pounced from close range to restore Hull's advantage as the match opened up. But some astute tactical kicking, and the reliable boot of Walsh, steered Dragons to just their second away over Hull in their past 13 attempts. Hull FC coach Lee Radford: \"It was painful to watch. The stop-start type of game was frustrating. The skillset of the group wasn't where it needs to be. \"We didn't take any juice out of them at their end of the field. It was smart by them and it's not the first time they've done that. You can't keep giving the ball away. \"I thought physically we were as good as we've been for a long time but we've got to be better with the ball. We looked as bad as we've had with ball in hand.\" Catalans Dragons coach Laurent Frayssinous: \"I'm very pleased but at the same time it's only round two. Something we learned from last year is to stay humble because we were in the top four at one stage and you saw how we finished. \"There are areas where we need to improve. We created some opportunities and could have scored more tries. Our last plays in the first half weren't good enough. \"But this was definitely a game we could have lost last season. We were patient, showed good defence and came up with the two points which is pleasing. \"The players work hard on and off the field and without a good team culture, you don't come to Hull FC and win, so it's a very good sign.\" Hull FC: Shaul: Fonua, Tuimavave, Griffin, Talanoa; Connor, Sneyd; Taylor, Houghton, Watts, Manu, Minichiello, Ellis.

        "article": "A man has admitted killing an 11-year-old girl in a hit-and-run in Glasgow. Christopher Hannah was driving a car which mounted the pavement and struck Sophie Brannan in Sandbank Street, Maryhill, on 14 November last year. Her friend Chelsea Sommerville, and Chelsea's uncle, Joseph Lloyd, were also badly injured. At the High Court in Glasgow, 33-year-old Hannah, who is said to be a heroin addict, admitted a charge of culpable homicide. Sentence was deferred. Following his guilty plea, the investigating officer Det Insp Colin Hailstones said: \"This was an appallingly tragic case. \"Many people in the community in Maryhill were deeply affected by this incident, particularly as it resulted in the death of young Sophie Brannan, whose life was sadly taken away from her at the age of 11 and at the hands of someone under the influence of drugs. \"Police officers worked tirelessly to piece together the events of that fateful night and I must thank the many members of the local community and those injured who helped provide information about the incident.\" He added: \"The strength shown from the community towards Sophie's family and the other people who were injured is unquestionable and much support continues to be given to them.\" The court heard that Hannah was driving a hired Vauxhall Astra in the area and lost control. He then fully mounted the pavement before hitting the gable end of a nearby building. The car continued to career forward eventually ploughing into Sophie and the two people with her from behind. Prosecutor Allan Nicol said: \"This caused them to be thrown onto the bonnet, windscreen and roof of the vehicle before falling onto the ground.\" Another driver witnessed the crash and turned back to help Sophie. More witnesses saw Hannah speed onto nearby Maryhill Road with his badly-dented car being \"driven erratically\". He then crashed into a taxi whose driver decided to follow Hannah, who eventually stopped a short distance away. Mr Nicol added: \"At that point, the accused was trying to pull the damaged front bumper then he stopped and walked away before starting to run off. \"Both the taxi driver and his passengers noticed that he was under the influence of some substance.\" Medics found Sophie lying on the pavement. She was rushed to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children at Yorkhill where she was found to have swelling to her brain, several fractures and broken bones. The schoolgirl remained in intensive care overnight but was pronounced dead on the morning of 15 November. The court heard that Chelsea suffered a serious leg break which will require long-term physiotherapy. She continues to wear a cast several months after the tragedy. Mr Nicol added: \"She also suffers episodes of withdrawal and angry outbursts. \"She is due to attend for psychiatric assessment in order to come to terms with her injuries and the loss of Sophie.\" Chelsea's uncle also suffered a number of fractures, but was initially released from hospital two days later. However, he eventually required surgery and it is likely he will have \"long-term restriction\" of movement in his right shoulder. Police discovered the Astra had been hired in Hannah's name on 14 October. The court also heard that shortly after the incident, police searched the home of Hannah's partner, where he had been staying. Mr Nicol said tin foil wraps with signs of drug use were discovered. The prosecutor told the court: \"On the day in question, she suspected he had been taking heroin as she was aware he is heroin-dependent.\" His partner revealed Hannah had come home earlier that night \"in shock\". Hannah had claimed he had hit someone, but did not know who. The killer said he was going to a house in the city's south side, but would return. Police were at the house when Hannah then called his girlfriend. She handed the phone to an officer and Hannah said: \"I'm sorry - I didn't mean to do it. \"It was a total accident. I lost control of the car and I panicked. I'm going to hand myself in tonight.\" The court heard that in the early hours of 17 November, Hannah turned up at a house in the city's Mount Florida area, but those inside decided to call police. Officers turned up and arrested Hannah, who initially tried to escape. He was later searched and eight grams of heroin were discovered inside his boxer shorts. The court heard how the occupants of the Mount Florida property later told police Hannah had called them on the night of the killing. Hannah said at the time: \"There's been an accident - watch the news. The police have fitted me up. \"I tried to get away and I have hit something. I don't know what.\" Mr Nicol told the court: \"He went on to say he had driven like a madman and that the something he had hit could have been a wheelie bin...but he didn't hang about to find out.\" Hannah asked to stay for a while as the police were after him \"because he had killed a wee lassie\". Accident investigators later concluded Hannah was solely to blame for what happened. It was stated he took \"a conscious decision\" to drive while \"impaired\". They added that the reason for him not stopping was because he knew he had taken drugs and was \"aware of the ramifications\". As well as culpable homicide, Hannah also pleaded guilty to dangerous driving, attempting to defeat the ends of justice and possessing heroin. It emerged he already had 14 previous convictions for crimes including having an offensive weapon and road traffic charges. He was on bail at the time, having been freed from Glasgow's Justice of the Peace Court two months before the crash. Hannah's advocate Thomas Ross said: \"He has asked to state publicly his apologies for those affected by this terrible tragedy.\" Lord Bannatyne remanded Hannah in custody and deferred sentencing until May.",

Rakhmat Akilov reportedly ran from the scene still covered in blood and glass, and was arrested hours later in a northern suburb of Stockholm. He has yet to be identified by police, who have only said that the man in custody is a 39-year-old Uzbek national. Even so, a picture of the man allegedly behind the attack has started to emerge: someone who had failed in his bid to get residency, lost his job and was hiding from police who wanted to deport him. Bumping into a former colleague earlier this year, he revealed he was spending his days \"sleeping and smoking\". According to reports, he had left a wife and four children behind in Uzbekistan in order to earn money to send home. He had applied for residency in 2014, but had been informed in December 2016 that \"he had four weeks to leave the country\", police official Jonas Hysing said. He did not leave and, in February, was officially put on a wanted list. A few months earlier, it is claimed he had lost his job after falling asleep at work. He had been working in construction, and was employed by Pierre Svensson for several weeks late last year, helping on an asbestos removal project. Mr Akilov was, he said, \"a reserved person\". \"He didn't stick out. He did his job. You can't say he was very sociable, we just told him what to do and he did it. He didn't speak much Swedish,\" he told news agency AFP. Mr Akilov was also described as not being particularly religious. One has suggested he \"partied and drank\", which goes against strict Islamic doctrine. \"He never talked about politics or religion,\" one friend told Swedish daily Aftonbladet. \"He didn't pray five times a day from what I know.\" A co-worker agreed, telling news agency Reuters: \"He was like any normal guy.\" Online, it seems, it was a different story. His Facebook page - which has since been taken down - is linked to a number of extremists through friends and featured at least two propaganda videos linked to IS, one reportedly showing the aftermath of the Boston bombing. He also liked a page called \"Friends of Libya and Syria\", which says it aims to expose \"terrorism of the imperialistic financial capitals\" of the US, British and Arab \"dictatorships\". However, he was also a fan of pages dedicated to Playboy magazine and Russian tennis player Maria Sharapova. Despite all this, Mr Akilov was not considered a threat by Swedish security services, who dismissed him as a \"marginal character\", apparently on the fringes of larger extremist movements.",

Tennant's successor, Matt Smith - also in the special with his new assistant played by Jenna-Louise Coleman - says fans \"will not be disappointed\" by the 3D show, due to air on 23 November. Tennant and Piper have long been rumoured to be making a return for the special, which is being written by the show's executive producer and lead writer Steven Moffat. In January, Piper, appearing on the Graham Norton show, denied she would be appearing. \"I wasn't asked, no,\" she said. \"I think Matt Smith may have said, in passing or in jest, it would be nice. \"I think maybe he said that and then it became something quite different, but no.\" Smith has said the show \"manages to pay homage to everything - and look forward\". \"I read it and I clapped at the end. I think it's hilarious, it's epic and it's vast,\" he said. Moffat, meanwhile, has said he took special care to protect the secrets of the story. \"One length I've gone to which is a really good security measure - I make sure I don't get a script, because I will lose it,\" he said. \"I forbid people to hand me one.

Friday is likely to be the busiest day of the year, with air traffic controllers expecting to handle more than 8,800 flights - a record number. They have called for a drastic modernisation in the way aircraft are guided across UK airspace. It comes as the government launches a discussion to shape the UK's aviation industry for the next 30 years. Air traffic controllers expect to manage a record 770,000 flights in UK airspace over the summer - 40,000 more than last year. But the ability of the the UK's National Air Traffic Control Service (Nats) to deal with this surge is being stretched to the limit, it is claimed. Nats director Jamie Hutchison said: \"In the last few weeks we have already safely managed record-breaking daily traffic levels, but the ageing design of UK airspace means we will soon reach the limits of what can be managed without delays rising significantly.\" The Department for Transport estimates that, if airspace management remains unchanged, there will be 3,100 days' worth of flight delays by 2030 - that is 50 times the amount seen in 2015 - along with 8,000 flight cancellations a year. The government wants the public to submit ideas on a wide range of subjects, from airport bag check-ins in town centres to noise reduction targets. The six themes it will consult on over the coming months are: Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said: \"Our new aviation strategy will look beyond the new runway at Heathrow and sets out a comprehensive long-term plan for UK aviation. \"It will support jobs and economic growth across the whole of the UK. \"Our vision puts the passenger at the heart of what we do, but also recognises the need to address the impacts of aviation on communities and the environment.\" Meanwhile, airport capacity is expanding way beyond Heathrow's new runway. Friday also marks the start of a \u00c2\u00a31bn investment programme to double the size of Manchester Airport's Terminal 2. The number of planes taking off and landing at Stansted has gone up every month for almost four years. Cardiff Airport has seen an 11% rise in traffic, and Luton is recording growth of 7% this year alone. The problem of volume has been complicated by shifts in travel patterns. Destinations including Egypt, Turkey and Tunisia have lost out to Spain, Italy and the US, which means major changes in the flows of traffic into UK airspace. Nats itself is rolling out a new \u00c2\u00a3600m ($747m) computer system known as iTec that could result in more flights and fewer delays. But Juliet Kennedy, Nats operations director, said: \"What is needed is a clear and stable UK policy that recognises how important our airspace is as a critical part of our national infrastructure. \"It is essential that we are able to balance the needs of airspace users with the environment and, of course, with the communities who experience aircraft noise.\"",

        "article": "After two years of inquest evidence, a detailed picture has built up of how an FA Cup match at Sheffield Wednesday's Hillsborough ground turned into a disaster that claimed 96 lives and left hundreds more injured. The semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest took place on Saturday 15 April, 1989. The match was sold out, meaning more than 53,000 fans from the two sides would head for Hillsborough for the 15.00 kick-off. Despite being a far larger club, Liverpool supporters were allocated the smaller end of the stadium, Leppings Lane, so that their route would not bring them into contact with Forest fans arriving from the south. Football crowds at the time had a reputation for hooliganism and strict segregation was enforced. Fans began arriving at Leppings Lane at about midday. The entrance had a limited number of turnstiles, of which just seven were allocated to the 10,100 fans with tickets for the standing terraces. Once through the turnstiles, supporters would have seen a wide tunnel leading down to the terrace and signposted \"Standing\". As was common practice in grounds at the time, the terrace was divided into \"pens\" by high fences that corralled fans into blocks and separated them from the pitch. The tunnel led directly into the two pens behind the goal, pens 3 and 4. Access to other pens was poorly-marked - a sign for refreshments was bigger than one showing the way to pens 1 and 2, the inquests heard. There was no system on the day to ensure fans were evenly distributed across the pens and no way of counting how many were in each pen. The match commander was Ch Supt David Duckenfield. He was new in his post and had limited experience of policing football matches. Police expected supporters to \"find their own level\" by spreading out across the pens in search of space, but this was difficult to do as movement between the pens was by narrow gates at the rear. By 14.15 a crowd had started to build outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles and it swelled rapidly over the next quarter of an hour. Progress through the seven turnstiles was slow and by 14.30 just 4,383 people had entered, meaning 5,700 ticketed fans were set to enter the ground in the half hour before kick-off. The inquests were told Mr Duckenfield and Supt Bernard Murray discussed delaying the kick off to allow fans to enter but decided against it. By 14.45 CCTV footage showed there were thousands of people pressing into the turnstiles and alongside a large exit gate, called Gate C. The funnel-shaped nature of the area meant that the congestion was hard to escape for those at the front. The turnstiles became difficult to operate and people were starting to be crushed. The police officer in charge of the area, Supt Roger Marshall, told the inquests he thought somebody was \"going to get killed here\" unless the exit gates were opened to alleviate the pressure. He made several requests and at 14.52, Mr Duckenfield gave the order and the gates were opened. About 2,000 fans then made their way into the ground. Most of those entering through Gate C headed straight for the tunnel leading directly to pens 3 and 4. This influx caused severe crushing in the pens. Fans began climbing over side fences into the relatively less packed adjoining pens to escape. The pens' official combined capacity was 2,200. It was later discovered this had not been updated since 1979, despite modifications made to the ground in the intervening decade. At 14.59, the game kicked off. Fans in the two central pens were pressed up against the fences and crush barriers. One barrier in pen 3 gave way, causing people to fall on top of each other. Those who survived told of seeing people lose consciousness in front of their eyes. Supporters continued to climb perimeter fences to escape, while others were dragged to safety by fans in the upper tiers. At 15.06 Supt Roger Greenwood ran on to the pitch and told the referee to stop the game. In the chaotic aftermath, supporters tore up advertising hoardings to use as makeshift stretchers and tried to administer first aid to the injured. The authorities' response to the disaster was slow and badly co-ordinated. Police delayed declaring a major incident and staff from South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service at the ground also failed to recognise and call a major incident. The jury decided this led to delays in the responses to the emergency. Firefighters with cutting gear had difficulty getting into the ground, and although dozens of ambulances were dispatched, access to the pitch was delayed because police were reporting \"crowd trouble\". Only two ambulances reached the Leppings Lane end of the pitch and of the 96 people who died, only 14 were ever admitted to hospital. For the jury in the inquests, police errors in planning, defects at the stadium and delays in the emergency response all contributed to the disaster. The behaviour of fans was not to blame. Match commander Ch Supt David Duckenfield had a duty of care to fans in the stadium that day, the jurors decided. They found he was in breach of that duty of care, that this amounted to gross negligence and that the 96 victims were unlawfully killed. The jury also concluded:",

        "article": "What does the government's counter-extremism strategy really amount to? I've previously blogged about the strategy's controversial plans to create banning orders for extremist groups. Prime Minister David Cameron wants to go further than create new punitive powers and, like his predecessor Tony Blair, reset the public debate on community cohesion and society's duty in combating all extremism. The government has already introduced two fundamental changes to how it wants to prevent violent extremism. Ministers have already cut funding to Muslim groups whom they suspect of harbouring views that are anathema to a liberal open democracy. Secondly, public bodies including schools and universities are now under a duty to prevent people being drawn into extremism. Mr Cameron now argues that fighting extremism demands a greater response from society by finding ways to intervene before someone has gone down the road that leads to violence - and his plans were first set out in July. He argued that his starting point was that the UK was \"a successful, multi-racial, multi-faith democracy\" to which Muslims had made a \"profound contribution\". They and wider society, he said, now need to dismantle the component parts of extremist ideology. This is easier said than done. For instance, the prime minister said he wants the government to work with and use people who understand the true nature of so-called Islamic State to prevent younger people listening to its recruitment sergeants. The government is talking about new specific deradicalisation programmes and \"empowering\" the UK's Syrians, Iraqis and Kurds to take a lead role in speaking out. How exactly they plan to do this remains unclear - not least because there are very few people who are qualified to carry out deradicalisation work. The recent case of a Blackburn teenager who plotted terrorism on the other side of the world shows how such work can ultimately be in vain. The elephant in the room is, of course, the internet. Ministers are trying to persuade social media companies to spend more of their dotcom millions on crushing extremism. Many of these firms  think there is only so much they can do when ISIS recruits continually relaunch themselves online under a new guise. Ministers are talking about social media bans for extremist preachers - but research shows that militants spread the message through innovative ways that are harder to stop. The government wants to create powers to curtail the activity of \"extremists\", even if they don't break hate laws or incite violence. Ministers argue that these people provide succour to those who want to use violence. One of the plans is to create powers to close \"mosques\" where extremists meet. Just putting aside the anecdotal evidence that recruitment regularly happens anywhere but the mosque, this idea was in fact first proposed 10 years ago by Tony Blair. And what that tells us is some of these proposals will ultimately come down to a fight over how to define extremism in an open society - and whether a policy aspiration can become clear and workable law. Expect serious legal fireworks in Parliament and in the courts for years to come. Minister say extremists are overpowering normal Muslim voices. The strategy is full of pitfalls. Back in January two ministers, the Muslim peer Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon and the then communities secretary Eric Pickles, wrote to imams in the wake of the Paris attacks. Critics within the community said the letter amounted to an accusation that Muslims were \"inherently apart\" from British society. The ministers believe the letter was taken the wrong way - not least because it said quite explicitly that Muslim and British values were the same. Today's plan to throw \u00c2\u00a35m over the next six months at groups prepared to join government in combating militants is likely to face some of the same critics - but it will also be welcomed by many community organisations who are crying out for funding and support to challenge extremism where they find it. David Cameron says he wants a more cohesive society - but that's terribly difficult to define and back-up in policy. For instance, in July he said there would be a review of how immigrants learn English. On the very same day, the Times Education Supplement reported the government's skills agency was cutting funding for language courses that were specifically targeted at integration into the workplace. This government isn't the first to talk about improving community cohesion. Labour began debating this after the 2001 northern riots and the official report that warned that people were living \"parallel lives\". So the challenge, ultimately, is whether the latest lot of ministers can do any better.",

        "article": "A 20-year-old US woman whose boyfriend took his own life nearly three years ago after she repeatedly urged him to suicide has gone on trial. Michelle Carter is charged with involuntary manslaughter for her role in the suicide of Conrad Roy III. Prosecutors allege Ms Carter drove the Massachusetts 18-year-old to his death to attract sympathy. She has asked a judge to rule on the case, rather than a jury of her peers. \"You need to do it, Conrad,\" Ms Carter texted him on the morning of 12 July, according to records presented by the Bristol County District Attorney's Office. \"You're ready and prepared. All you have to do is turn the generator on and you will be free and happy,\" she wrote. She told him in another message: \"You're finally going to be happy in heaven. No more pain. It's okay to be scared and it's normal. I mean, you're about to die.\" As he expressed doubts, she kept pushing. \"I thought you wanted to do this. The time is right and you're ready \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6  just do it babe,\" she said. \"No more pushing it off. No more waiting,\" she went on. Mr Roy was found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning in his vehicle at a Kmart car park in Fairhavens, Massachusetts, on 13 July 2014. Texts show he wavered in his plan to follow through with the suicide, at one point getting out of his pick-up truck. Ms Carter replied in a message: \"Get back in.\" After his death, she fundraised for mental health awareness and led a charity softball event in his honour. Mr Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, told the court on Tuesday she had no warning of her son's suicide. She said: \"I thought he was a little depressed.\" On the day of his death, Mr Roy went to the seaside in Westport, Massachusetts, with his mother and sisters, according to prosecutors. He bought his sisters ice cream, joked about bathing suits and spoke of a scholarship he had just won, while making other plans for the future. As arguments began on Tuesday, images of his text exchanges with Ms Carter were broadcast on the courtroom wall. \"She used Conrad as a pawn,\" said Assistant District Attorney Maryclare Flynn, adding that the accused had wanted to gain attention as the \"grieving girlfriend\". \"She talked him out of his doubts point-by-point, assured him that his family would understand why he did it, researched logistics and reassured him that he was likely to succeed, and pushed him to stop procrastinating and get on with it, mocking his hesitation,\" said the prosecutor. Lawyers had requested the case be dismissed on the grounds of right to free speech. But a juvenile court judge ruled that encouraging suicide was not protected under the US constitution. Defence lawyer Joseph Cataldo argued that Mr Roy had been motivated to kill himself for some time, and that his depression was spurred by family troubles. He told the court that Ms Carter had previously talked her boyfriend out of suicide attempts. Recently unsealed documents show Mr Roy attempted to take his own life several times before, and had spent time researching methods online. Defence lawyer Mr Cataldo said in court: \"My heart goes out to the family, but this was a young man who planned this for months and months\". According to local media reports, Ms Carter had also texted Mr Roy that his parents would \"get over\" his suicide. \"You've hit that point and I think your parents know you've hit that point,\" the accused texted. \"You said your mom saw a suicide thing on your computer and she didn't say anything. I think she knows it's on your mind and she's prepared for it. \"Everyone will be sad for a while but they will get over it and move on. They won't be in depression. I won't let that happen. They know how sad you are, and they know that you are doing this to be happy and I think they will understand and accept it. \"They will always carry you in their hearts.\" Mr Roy replied: \"Aww. Thank you, Michelle.\" If you are depressed and need to ask for help, there's advice on who to contact at BBC Advice. From Canada or US: If you're in an emergency, please call 911. If you or someone you know is suffering with mental-health issues, call Kids Help Phone at 1-800-668-6868.

Snowdonia Giving asks businesses in the national park to press visitors for a small contribution to add to bills. Launched six months ago, so far 28 companies have signed up. Nearly \u00c2\u00a33,500 in donations has been raised, with most going to a Snowdonia Society training programme. John Harold, director of the society, said: \"This is the Snowdonia Society's 50th anniversary and this is a real birthday present for us. \"What it does is it allows us to complete the circle of giving - visitors and locals giving voluntarily to these local businesses. \"We take our volunteers out to help look after Snowdon and the surrounding area, and this funding gives us the chance to give something back to those volunteers.\" The Snowdonia Giving project cash will be used to give 48 young people the chance to learn both conservation and mountain skills, which will go towards an accredited qualification. \"What we find is, there are plenty of young people who are willing to come out and volunteer, many of whom would like to work outdoors, some of whom want to work in conservation,\" added Mr Harold. \"The problem these days is getting experience and getting that experience on your CV - and this is one of the things we can help them with.\" Josh Feilden runs one of the firms that has been taking part in the pilot project, running a sustainable bunkhouse lodging business called Crashpad Lodge on the slopes of Snowdon. He said visitors staying with him were eager to take part. \"It is surprising how much impact and how involved they want to be in it,\" he said. \"If they know they are putting money towards a good contribution, which it is going to go to, they are more than happy.\" Another business owner, Ross Worthington, who runs the outdoor training specialists Raw Adventures with his wife Kate, who is also chairwoman of the British Mountaineering Council in Wales. He is convinced the \"exciting\" project can expand and deliver even more for the communities across Snowdonia. \"We have a new season ahead, lots more engagement with people, with other companies, and it's looking like a really promising scheme,\" he added. The project is due to run until October this year, with the social enterprise Arloesi Gwynedd Wledig pulling together all the strands of the scheme for now.

        "article": "NHS spending on private ambulances for 999 calls in England has trebled in four years, BBC research has found. Ambulance trusts paid private companies and voluntary organisations \u00a368.7m to attend emergency calls in 2015-6, compared to \u00a322.1m in 2011-2. They respond to all types of calls. NHS England said 999 calls for ambulances rose 4.5% last year. Unions attacked \"creeping privatisation\" and called for more money for staff recruitment. The ambulance service in England took 861,000 emergency phone calls in March 2016 - which equates to 27,800 a day - compared to 22,400 calls a day in March 2015, a rise of 24%. Contractors include private firms and charities such as St John Ambulance and the British Red Cross. Is the ambulance service at breaking point? Martin Flaherty, of the Association of Ambulance Chief Executives, said trusts faced \"unprecedented levels of demand\" and used private or volunteer services \"in support when absolutely necessary... at times of peak demand\". \u00a346m per year extra spent on private ambulances since 2011/12 4.5% rise in the number of 999 calls for ambulances over past year \u00a313.6m spent by South Central Ambulance Service on private ambulances in 2014/15 9% of South East Coast Ambulance Service 999 calls were responded to with a private ambulance Of the 11 ambulance trusts, South Central spent the most; \u00a313.6m in the year to April 2016. London spent \u00a311.9m, according to Freedom of Information requests gathered by BBC South East. West Midlands and Isle of Wight said they rarely or never use ambulances from independent providers. East of England gave nine months of data for 2015-16. South East Coast Ambulance Service (SECAMB) said private ambulances responded to 9% of its emergency calls last year, at a cost of \u00a310.4m.  The previous year it spent \u00a312.3m. SECAMB operations manager James Pavey said it faced an \"extraordinary rise in demand\" and had a growing shortage of paramedics. Some trusts, such as London and SECAMB, are now hiring from abroad, including Australia. The College of Paramedics said there were problems recruiting and retaining sufficient staff, who now have to be trained to degree level. College director Richard Webber said: \"In the long term, we should not be using private providers in the way we are, but we do need to provide a safe and effective service to the public.\" \"We should employ more people, training and supporting them effectively and providing that as part of the NHS.\" A Department of Health spokesman said: \"We have employed 2,000 more paramedics since 2010 and training an extra 1,900 over the next five years.\" Unions said money should not be leaving the NHS and called for higher pay to attract staff. Alan Lofthouse, Unison lead officer for ambulance workers said: \"It is creeping privatisation, something we are very concerned about. \"In the short term people need an ambulance. But in the long term they can not be part of a fully-funded system because there is a profit being made by private companies.\" Private providers said they were regulated by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) and faced more scrutiny than NHS ambulance services. Alan Howson, of the Independent Ambulance Association, said any perception of private ambulances being unsafe was out-of-date. \"This is no longer back-street ambulance services providing independent cover. \"Quite often, crews from independent ambulance providers perform better than their NHS counterparts and that is also borne out from patient feedback.\" James Barnes of the Private Ambulance Company, which has a contract for the East of England, said: \"There is a strict set of guidelines we have to meet or could be shut down.\" Using private ambulances to answer 999 calls is just another example of the health service under pressure. The number of calls to ambulances has more than doubled in the past decade to over 9m a year. They are also facing increasing delays at hospital with A&E departments run ragged dealing with the record numbers of patients coming through their doors. Crews find themselves queuing before they can handover their patients. It means the eight minute target for responding to patients is being missed - by a record margin.  Unions say recruitment and retention is a major issue in many services. So bosses are turning to private firms. They are fully regulated and vetted, but the situation is still far from ideal.

        "article": "Most riders are unhappy about plans to have horse racing on Good Friday, says the chief executive of the Professional Jockeys' Association. They are worried about losing a rare rest day and the effect on their awards night, Paul Struthers said. The move - supported by top female rider Hayley Turner - could provide the sport with a windfall of more than \u00a31m. But the organiser of a Good Friday charity open day has called the proposal \"greedy and selfish\". Pros \u2022 Would give sport a commercial lift, with extra prize money, betting and racecourse revenue \u2022 Could regenerate the all-weather programme, with a 'Champions Series' style schedule building to a Good Friday finale \u2022 Racing on most other Bank Holidays attracts good crowds Cons \u2022 Jockeys already struggle to spend time with families and some object to Good Friday racing for religious reasons \u2022 Annual Lesters awards, where jump and flat jockeys celebrate success, are held the night before \u2022 Popular Lambourn and Middleham Open Days take place on the same day Several trainers and others within the industry have also voiced their backing for what they see as a unique chance to exploit a valuable commercial opportunity. The British Horseracing Authority (BHA) has invited applications from racecourses to stage fixtures on Good Friday for the first time from next year. While a final decision is not expected before 30 September, it is understood the governing body is minded to allow two fixtures on 18 April, 2014, provided they meet criteria around prize money and forecast attendances. BHA chief executive Paul Bittar said his organisation was aware of the \"historical sensitivities\", but added that it was \"a significant leisure day, so we are keen to fully assess the opportunity for racing\". Arena Racing, which owns Lingfield racecourse, has proposed a \u00a31m championship meeting at the Surrey track on Good Friday. It would form part of a wider revamp of the all-weather winter racing schedule, while Musselburgh in Scotland would also like to race. But jockeys are concerned they will lose one of only four blank days in the racing calendar, and one which falls the day after their popular annual Lesters awards - the sport's equivalent of the Oscars named after legendary jockey Lester Piggott. Jockey Hayley Turner (Racing UK) \"A lot of other sports take place on Good Friday and I think racing is adopting a slightly old-school attitude. \"We are in the entertainment business and as jockeys we want to ride in front of bigger crowds, which is more likely to happen during weekends and holidays.\" Trainer Charlie Brooks (Daily Telegraph): \"There is no computer in the world that can quantify the long-term benefits of engaging with the next generation of racing fans at these open days. \"And fostering a love of the racehorse rather than bouncy castles, cheap beer and tribute bands is the right way forward.\" \"Most jockeys are unhappy about the idea. It would leave just three days off [23, 24 and 25 December],\" said Struthers, whose organisation represents about 450 riders. \"They can choose not to ride, but a trainer or owner who wanted them is unlikely to have them again. \"If this goes through, a blank day elsewhere in the calendar is vital for the survival of the Lesters. \"Plans for more investment in all-weather racing are welcome, but the logic that there has to be a Good Friday finale does not stack up.\" He said some jockeys, including Irish Catholics, were against the idea on religious grounds. \"It is going to be a huge dilemma for those who see it as a religious issue,\" said Struthers. He said there were two \"weak\" Saturdays in late March/April where a big all-weather race day could be accommodated. Struthers acknowledges some jockeys are in favour of another chance to showcase their talents - and Turner is one of them. \"I am a little surprised by the opposition to it, some of which has been very aggressive,\" Turner, who has just returned from being sidelined with a broken ankle, told Racing UK. \"Coming from a jockey, who has just spent five weeks on the sidelines, I relish the opportunity to be riding as much as I can, especially in the higher profile races.\" At the racing centre of Lambourn in Berkshire, more than 30 trainers open their yards to the public on Good Friday with an estimated 10,000 people meeting horses and trainers. A similar event has been held for 20 years in Middleham, North Yorkshire. Lambourn organising committee chairman Mark Smyly said his event - which was called off due to waterlogging this year - raised about \u00a360,000 in 2012 for charity, much of which went to a housing project for working and retired stable staff. \"It is not just racing people who come to the open day. The PR for the sport is enormous and to do away with that is just greedy and selfish,\" said Smyly, who helped to run the first open day 23 years ago. \"It brings in a lot of new owners to the sport and there must be other days when they can have racing - why not make Easter Sunday a big day?\" An Arena Racing spokesman said they were aware of \"some opposition\" but declined to comment ahead of the BHA decision.",

They will also find it harder to amass wealth in the future, it added. The think tank found that people born in the early 1980s were the first post-war group not to have higher incomes in early adulthood than those born in the preceding decade. \"This is partly the result of the overall stagnation of working-age incomes,\" it said. \"But it also reflects the fact that the great recession hit the pay and employment of young adults the hardest.\" Jessica Lucas, 27 A lot of my friends can't find a way to get a deposit for a house. A lot of them are struggling - working full time, sometimes working two jobs - and that's just to rent. Renting alone is causing us a lot of trouble to save up for a house, so I don't know how we're going to get out of the vicious cycle of renting to then own. Adam Snape, 36 For pretty much everyone I know around my age it's hard to get a house. Everyone was spending on credit cards that were limitless and people could get another one and another one. People didn't think they needed a plan really. What is the norm now is renting. It's getting a lot more like Europe. It's becoming a bit of a daydream that people can buy a house. \"It looks like those born in the early 1980s are likely to find it harder than their predecessors to build up wealth in housing and pensions as they age,\" said report author Andrew Hood. \"They have much lower home-ownership rates in early adulthood than any other post-war cohort, and - outside the public sector - have much less access to generous defined benefit pension schemes than previous generations did at the same age.\" \"Wealth\" as defined by the IFS includes property, savings and investments, and money held in private pensions - minus any debts a person may have such as student loans or credit cards. By Simon Gompertz, personal finance correspondent There is plenty to celebrate for younger generations: better health, longer lives, more interesting food, travel and technology. But there is no avoiding the financial hit which thirty-somethings have suffered as latecomers to the property and pensions game. It's as if they had sat down to a Monopoly binge on a rainy afternoon, only to be told they couldn't collect \u00c2\u00a3200 on passing go and couldn't have any houses of their own. They could only rent. What does the future hold if you are in your early 30s? There is little sign of the situation getting any better. Property prices remain out of reach for many. Few have the gold-plated pensions of yesteryear. The worst case scenario is the thought of millions reaching old age, still renting, with paltry savings and more likely to turn to the state for support. Campbell Robb, housing charity Shelter's chief executive, said: \"With sky-high house prices so out of step with average wages, it's no wonder a whole generation are being priced out of a home of their own and left with no choice but expensive, unstable private renting. \"At Shelter we see the impact of our chronic shortage of affordable homes every day, with thousands of people forking out most of their income on rent and left living from one pay cheque to the next.\" Laura Gardiner, from the Resolution Foundation think tank which works to improve the living standards of those in the UK, said this was not just a problem for the 30-something generation - often referred to as Millennials. \"If we have far higher proportions of pensioners renting in years to come this is going to put a far higher cost on the state to support them through things like housing benefit - this is an individual and collective problem,\" she said. She also said there were other knock-on impacts, for example young people with unsecured debt were much less likely to take risks in the labour market.",

        "article": "Three soldiers killed in a Taliban bomb blast should have been warned about insurgent activity in the area, a coroner has said. Corporal William Savage, 30, from Penicuik, Fusilier Samuel Flint, 21, and Private Robert Hetherington, 25, both from Edinburgh, died in the blast. They were killed on Route 611 in the Nahr-e-Saraj district on 30 April 2013. The soldiers, who were in an armoured Mastiff vehicle, were unlawfully killed on active service, the coroner ruled. Coroner, Darren Salter, will now write to Defence Secretary Michael Fallon. The inquest was held at Oxfordshire Coroners Court. Earlier, it heard that an improvised explosive device (IED) had been put in place using a tunnel and was triggered using a command wire from behind the 10ft wall of a nearby compound. Post-mortem examinations concluded the three, who were with B Company, 2nd Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland, would have been deeply unconscious virtually instantly and unaware of what had happened. Mr Salter said the Mastiff was designed to resist improvised explosive device (IED) attacks. There had been earlier damage to this one, the second of three evolutions of the vehicle, in a strike in 2009. However, there was \"no significant evidence\" that the vehicle failed to provide the \"expected level of protection\", Mr Salter ruled. He also noted that experts referred to the size of the explosion as a \"blast overmatch\" and that the men were seated in the rear of the vehicle, which was nearest to the explosion. The men died when an improvised explosive device (IED) tore through their heavily armoured Mastiff vehicle on April 30 last year. The Royal Military Police made inquiries to the Afghan National Police about the incident, but no-one was arrested over it. The Mastiff, a protective patrol vehicle, had gone from Forward Operating Base Ouellette to another base at Lashkar Gah Durai and was on its way back again when the attack happened. There were four vehicles in the patrol. The driver of the Mastiff, Fusilier Paul Howell, said in a statement that the regular locks to the rear doors had been faulty, and he had reported them twice. He told the inquest that on the day in question, though they were stiff, they were fully sealed when closed. Extra battle locks were not deployed, but they were not supposed to be when the vehicle was in open desert, only when there were potential public order situations, he said. He said in his statement that there were 20 ammunition tins under the seats in the rear, which was normal. The inquest heard that the IED was buried under the road, had been placed there by tunnelling, and was triggered by a command wire, probably from behind the 10ft wall of a nearby compound. Sgt David Boxwell, who was in command of the patrol, said he had not been told of any problems relating to the place where the blast took place. As for tunnelling under the road, he earlier said: \"I had never heard of it before.\" Company Sgt Major Steven Main said: \"Everything we had had was off the tarmac road. IEDs were placed in the dust - it's easier to conceal.\" He said there was no sign on the ground of the IED. \"The wire was so deep that we would not have seen it.\"",

        "article": "Billions of pounds owed in child maintenance may never be recovered, government accounts show. The money is owed by absent parents who have been referred to the Child Support Agency. Accounts prepared for Parliament by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) class \u00a32.9bn of the \u00a33.9bn in maintenance arrears as \"uncollectable\". Ministers said the focus was on debts for children still being brought up, but old debts would not be \"forgotten\". The Child Support Agency (CSA) was set up 21 years ago with the aim of ensuring that if a relationship broke down, a parent could not just walk off and leave an ex to pay the costs of bringing up their children. The CSA's role was to calculate maintenance - and ensure that non-resident parents paid up. But it has been dogged with problems. Computer systems did not work properly. Mistakes were made with assessments and absent parents were not tracked down. In 2012, a new child maintenance system was introduced in an effort to draw a line under the CSA's difficulties. The Child Maintenance Service, as the new system is called, does not consider recovering the historic debts on the CSA's books as a priority. Around 1.3 million single parents are owed money the CSA ruled they were entitled to - and some have been waiting years. One single parent, Marianne Miles from London, said she badly needed the money the CSA ordered her ex-partner to pay towards their son. But after nearly seven years of waiting for payment, she has all but given up. \"I am not hopeful of seeing any of that money to be perfectly honest,\" she said. \"They [the CSA] haven't made much effort to get anything - even \u00a330 a week - so I have practically written off all of it.\" In 2008, Marianne Miles, from London, was made redundant from her job as a publicist. Raising her teenage son alone became a severe financial struggle. She turned to the CSA, which ordered her ex-partner to contribute. To this day, she still has not received the money owed, which has built up to a total of \u00a312,000. \"I try not to get angry about it, but it's not fair,\" she said. \"If he owed the government council tax money, or for a parking ticket, they would pursue it and make sure it was paid. But when it's paying maintenance towards your own child, it is not deemed as important.\" Her son is now 20 and has left home, but Marianne is still responsible for him financially. \"Just because he didn't have it before doesn't mean he doesn't need it now,\" she said. \"It would make a huge difference. \"He's a student so it could go towards his books and his food, that I have to support, and he's learning how to drive. I'm the only person around to help him.\" Janet Allbeson, from the single-parent charity Gingerbread, believes the government should be recovering unpaid maintenance, even in cases that have been going on for years. She said: \"If they do manage to get the money, even if it is years late, it can really make a difference to a child's life. \"It allows, for instance, to help with the cost of going to college, perhaps paying off a student loan, or helping a child learn to drive. \"Children in some ways get more expensive as they get older and that money can make a real difference to a child's future.\" The government said it was prioritising cases where a child was still being brought up. Steve Webb, the minister with responsibility for child maintenance, said: \"We are quite clear that just because money has been owed for a long time it does not mean it should be forgotten about. It should be paid. \"Of course everything cannot be a priority. We have been quite transparent\u2026 and we have made it clear that where there is a child still at school or being brought up - that is the first priority. \"But we are not writing off or ignoring old debt.\" But figures in DWP accounts published in December raise questions about how much of the arrears backlog is likely to be recovered. The \u00a32.9bn listed as \"uncollectable\" relates to cases where either no payment has been received from the absent parent in the previous six months, or no arrears schedule has been put in place. The DWP said the definition of \"uncollectable\" in the accounts did not give a true picture of the level of debt that is beyond its enforcement powers - and in fact only \u00a3244m was permanently \"uncollectable\".

        "article": "The gap between male and female life expectancy is closing and men could catch up by 2030, according to an adviser for the Office for National Statistics. Prof Les Mayhew said the difference between the sexes peaked at nearly six years in the 1970s. Life expectancy is going up all round, but the rates for men are increasing faster. Plummeting smoking rates in men are thought to explain a lot of the change. Prof Mayhew, a professor of statistics at Cass Business School, analysed life expectancy data in England and Wales. He was working out how long 30-year-olds could expect to live. His findings show men languishing far behind for decades, but now starting to get closer to women. If current trends continue, Prof Mayhew predicts, both sexes could, on average, be living to the age of 87 in 2030. He said: \"What's interesting at the moment is that in the last 20 years or so, male life expectancy at 30 has jumped by about six years and if it jumps by the same amount in the next 20 years it will converge with female life expectancy.\" The reason could be down to men living a healthier lifestyle. \"One of the main reasons, I think, is the trend in the prevalence of smoking. Smoking took off after 1920 in the male population and at its high about 80% of males smoked. \"This was reflected in more divergence in the life expectancy, so by the time you get to about 1970 it was at its peak - the difference in life expectancy was about 5.7 years.\" Other factors are thought to be safer, more office-based, jobs. Millions of men used to work in hazardous occupations such as coal mining. Healthcare has meant more men live longer as well. People with heart disease, which is more common in men, can expect to live much longer than they did a few decades ago. By contrast, women started smoking later than men.   , but are falling fast in men. A boy and a girl born on the same day will still not have the same life expectancies, as the study looked only at people who had already reached 30. Boys are more likely to die in their first year of life and are more likely to take up dangerous sports or be involved in fatal accidents. It means that women could still have the edge for some time to come. Prof David Leon, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: \"In virtually all countries in the world, women do have a slight advantage.\" However, he said the gap was definitely closing in some countries. Countries with lower levels of life expectancy, such as in sub-Saharan Africa, showed very little difference between the genders. This was due to the prevalence of infectious diseases which \"are not picky about men and women\", he said. In countries that had defeated most infectious diseases, such as in Eastern Europe, \"there is a much bigger difference, mostly dominated by lifestyle factors\". At one point in the 1990s, the gap between life expectancies in Russia reached 13 years. Prof Leon said it was an \"absolutely massive\" difference in a \"very gendered society\". In his third class of countries, such as the UK, the gap in life expectancies is starting to narrow. He said: \"Men are getting a bit better behaved and women are adopting male life expectancies.\"",

        "article": "The emotional father of a US student freed by North Korea this week says he does not believe the regime's explanation for his son's coma. The regime said 22-year-old Otto Warmbier's medical condition was caused last year by botulism and a sleeping pill he was given after his trial. But Fred Warmbier said his son had been treated \"brutally\". He spoke as an Ohio hospital said Otto had suffered a \"severe neurological injury\" and is in a stable condition. \"We went for 15 months without a word from or about Otto,\" Mr Warmbier said of his son, who fought back tears at Thursday's press conference in Cincinnati, Ohio. \"It was only a week ago that the North Korean government now claims that he was in a coma for almost all of that time. \"Even if you believe their explanation of botulism and a sleeping pill causing the coma - and we don't - there's no excuse for a civilised nation to have kept his condition secret and to have denied him top notch medical care.\" Otto Warmbier, an economics student from the University of Virginia, was arrested in January 2016 while visiting North Korea as a tourist. Botulism is a type of poisoning which can cause total body paralysis, difficulty in breathing and death in some cases. It's caused by the clostridium botulinum bacteria, but the symptoms of botulism are not from the bacteria themselves. Instead, the microscopic organisms produce a powerful toxin which attacks the nervous system and causes paralysis. That poison is called botulinum - which you may know for its commercial use in Botox, which removes wrinkles by paralysing facial muscles. Botulism is contracted in two ways in adults - by eating food contaminated with the toxin, or through wounds. The foodborne method happens when the bacteria are tinned or stored in food in another way that deprives them from air (which is when they produce the poison). This rarely happens in modern western food production, but is what North Korea claims happened to Mr Warmbier. He was given a 15-year prison sentence for attempting to steal a propaganda sign from a hotel. Fred Warmbier told reporters his son had been held as a \"war criminal'. He said he and his wife, Cindy, had relied \"on this false premise that they would treat Otto fairly and let him go\". In honour of his son, Fred Warmbier wore the same jacket Otto was wearing when he was paraded before media to tearfully confess to attempting to take the sign as a \"trophy\" for a US church. Mr Warmbier also appeared to criticise the Obama administration for failing to help secure his son's release. How harsh is prison in North Korea? \"When Otto was first taken we were advised by the past administration to take a low profile while they worked to obtain his release,\" he said. \"We did so without result. Earlier this year Cindy and I decided the time for strategic patience was over.\" The university student was freed hours after US basketball star Dennis Rodman arrived in North Korea, but Fred Warmbier said the professional athlete's visit had nothing to do with his son's release. The US has in the past accused North Korea of detaining Americans as political pawns in negotiations over its nuclear weapons programme. Pyongyang has accused Washington and South Korea of sending spies to overthrow its regime. Three Americans remain in custody in North Korea. The detentions have come at a time of heightened tension between North Korea and the US and its regional neighbours.",

Alan Solomons' side had scored a wonderful try through centre Will Helu after Munster had started strongly with a John Ryan score. Sam Hidalgo-Clyne kicked three penalties with a host of returning World Cup internationals on both teams. But the scrum-half saw his dramatic drop-goal attempt charged down three minutes into overtime. With just three minutes gone, Ryan muscled between Edinburgh's centres to ground the ball against the base of the post, Keatley converting. Hidalgo-Clyne replied with a penalty and Munster's Gerhard van den Heever was sin-binned for colliding with the airborne Tom Brown, but Edinburgh - supreme in the scrummage and wayward come the lineout - failed to capitalise significantly on the winger's absence. Keith Earls came within a whisker of a second try, haring after a sumptuous Conor Murray box kick deep into the Edinburgh 22, but spilling the bouncing ball at the corner flag as the cover defence heaved him out of play. Keatley thumped over a penalty from just inside Edinburgh's half after the home pack shunted a fraction too early in the scrum and Hidalgo-Clyne slotted his second three-pointer to bring the hosts back within four points at the break. Under Solomons, Edinburgh have relied more upon a pulverising pack than abandon out wide, but the try they crafted shortly after half-time was a work of some beauty. It started with Cornell du Preez, the back-row, fielding a kick in his own half and releasing Damien Hoyland down the wing with a delightful offload. Youngster Hoyland danced and shimmied his way through the Munster defenders, before the ball was swept to the other flank via Hamish Watson and Tom Brown to find Helu, who raced for the corner and grounded powerfully. Hidalgo-Clyne's conversion attempt ricocheted back off the upright. Keatley then hooked a penalty effort wide from distance and Munster lost a second man to the flash of David Wilkinson's yellow card, All Black centre Francis Saili binned as he was caught on the wrong side of a ruck. Hidalgo-Clyne converted the resulting penalty, but Munster's pivot cancelled it out with one of his own five minutes later. There is little doubt Edinburgh are on an upward trajectory, but there are still rough edges, notably in the fluidity of the backline play, to be refined - the number of infuriating fumbled passes will have more than irked Solomons. From one such vexing spill, replacement prop John Andress brought a scrum crashing to ground and Keatley regained Munster's lead with a huge kick from the tee. The visitors turned the screw. Keatley arrowed the ball in behind Brown and the Irish pack lay siege to Edinburgh's line, yielding a yellow card for the hosts' fly-half Greig Tonks. Edinburgh rallied well, though, resisting Munster's advances, and with the clock almost red, Hoyland intercepted in his own 22 to race downfield and set up a heart-stopping, but ultimately fruitless, finale.

I try to watch movies, but it's quite difficult. \"But these are all of the negatives,\" she added. \"What I can do, I do. And I somehow get by.\" The actress, 79, has age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The condition, which affects more than 600,000 people in the UK, is the cause of more than half of the registrations for blind and partially sighted people in the country. Dame Judi first revealed her diagnosis in 2012, noting her mother had suffered from the same condition. But even before her eyesight began to decline, the Oscar-winner said she preferred to have scripts read aloud to her, as Steve Coogan did for the Oscar-nominated Philomena. \"I suppose it's the child in me,\" she said. \"I think somebody coming around and telling you a story is irresistible.\" The actress said she had no plans to step away from the stage or the camera, calling retirement \"the rudest word in my dictionary\". \"And 'old' is another one. I don't allow that in my house. And being called 'vintage'. I don't want any of those old words. \"I like 'enthusiastic' and I like the word 'cut' because that means you've finished the shot.\" Dame Judi made her professional acting debut at the Old Vic in 1957 and was an acclaimed stage and TV actress before being cast as M in the rejuvenated James Bond franchise in 1995. Two years later, she appeared as Queen Victoria in the TV drama Mrs Brown, which was picked up by film studio Miramax and became a global box office hit. The film kick-started her Hollywood career, and the relationship with Miramax boss Harvey Weinstein brought Dame Judi her only Oscar to date, for an eight-minute cameo as Queen Elizabeth in the 1998 movie Shakespeare in Love. She has since received Academy nominations for roles in Chocolat, Iris, Mrs Henderson Presents, Notes on a Scandal and, this year, for Philomena. She is currently in India filming The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel 2, but her best-known role continues to be James Bond's boss. But, after playing a pivotal role alongside Daniel Craig in Skyfall in 2012, the actress left the part behind, bequeathing it to Ralph Fiennes. \"My role as M is over,\" she told The Hollywood Reporter, \"but having had 17 years I think, probably, I would have been given the sack by MI6 already. So it's someone else's turn.\" On a lighter note, the star also revealed that she had, on more than one occasion, brought her pet goldfish back to life. \"I've given the breath of life to [him] twice,\" she said. \"He's now about 8 inches long - almost a full shark - and yes, twice, I breathed into his mouth.

The platform was set in the first half as Wasps dominated field position and they went in 14-3 up thanks to tries from Christian Wade and Beale. Tom Homer's penalty was the only reply from Bath, who conceded a third try when slick hands worked Beale in. Bath fought hard after the break, but Wasps' 13th win was never in doubt. Both sides occupy places in the top four, but even with internationals Taulupe Faletau, Luke Charteris and Anthony Watson back in the side, Bath looked well short of competing with the expensively-recruited visitors. England star Elliot Daly was absent for Wasps, but Dai Young was still able to field a back three of Beale, Christian Wade and Willie Le Roux and most importantly, they won the front-foot ball needed to get them in the game. The forwards laid the platform for both first-half tries, Alex Rieder stepping through to give Wade a chance on the right and Thomas Young ripping a hole for Beale's first. His second was again built on softening up by the Wasps forwards, followed by a sliding move to the left that well and truly put the game beyond doubt. Wasps director of rugby Dai Young: \"Today we took a big stride in cementing our place in the top four. That's the important thing. Then you've got four games to cement ourselves in the top two. \"It's not a foregone conclusion by any means. \"This is the best we have played in the block of four games (during the Six Nations). Now we are in the business end. We've got Worcester and Bristol, two teams who will be scrapping for their lives. There's no easy games for us but we are in a very strong position, one I am very pleased with.\" Bath director of rugby Todd Blackadder: \"We looked tired out there, just hanging on.

        "article": "A Texas police department has changed a key detail in the shooting of an unarmed black teenager, amid mounting calls for the officer to be arrested. Jordan Edwards, 15, died after Officer Roy Oliver fired a rifle into a car that was driving away from a party in the Dallas suburb of Balch Springs. Police initially said the car reversed \"aggressively\" towards the officer, but footage discredits that claim. Police Chief Jonathan Haber said he \"misspoke\". Officer Oliver has been fired violating several department policies, a police statement said, adding that the department \"cannot give further details on which policies have been violated since Roy Oliver can appeal the termination\". Officer Oliver fired into a car full of teenagers as they left a party on Saturday night, Chief Haber said after reviewing the body-cam video. The car was actually driving forward - away from police - and not reversing toward them when the shots were fired, he explained. \"I was unintentionally incorrect yesterday when I said that the victim's vehicle was backing down the road,\" Mr Haber said on Monday. \"In fact, according to the video that I viewed, the vehicle was moving forward as the officers approached.\" The officer's behaviour \"did not meet our core values\", the police chief said. Jordan, who was in the front passenger seat, died after being shot in the back of the head. His 16-year-old brother and three friends were detained at the scene and taken to the Dallas County Sheriff's Department, where they were interviewed as witnesses. Jordan's cause of death has been ruled a homicide, however, that does not necessarily mean charges will be filed against the officer. The Dallas County Sheriff's Department and the Dallas County District Attorney's Office are conducting a criminal investigation. The incident occurred on Saturday night when police responded to reports of underage drinking at a house party where around 100 kids had gathered, neighbours said. Officers were inside the home trying to find the owner when they heard outside what they believed to be gunshots, causing panic at the home as people fled. After going outside, the police officer fired several shots which killed Jordan, a first-year American football player at Mesquite High School. His coach, Jeff Fleener, told the Dallas Morning News that he was \"crushed and heartbroken\" to learn that Jordan had been killed. \"You create a checklist of everything you would want in a player, a son, a teammate, a friend, and Jordan had all that. He was that kid,\" he said. A vigil was held at the school on Monday evening, and the school district said they are \"mourning this terrible loss\". Lee Merritt, lawyer for Jordan's family, demanded the officer's arrest on Monday. \"We are declaring war on bad policing,\" he said as Jordan's parents sat silently beside him, wiping their eyes with tissues and gazing downwards. \"America throughout the country must figure out a way to police its citizens without killing them,\" he continued.",

        "article": "An ex-youth worker jailed for child sex offences could have been approved as a foster carer, a case review has found. An investigation into Pembrokeshire council's dealings with Michael Smith said it was \"only luck\" that stopped his application. The 2015 review was confidential, but a copy of the report has been exclusively obtained by the Western Telegraph. It revealed a head of service initially failed to provide information of child protection concerns about Smith. Pembrokeshire council said \"it is unfortunate that a member of the authority has seen fit to disclose the report, contrary to advice\". Smith, from Haverfordwest, was employed as a youth worker for the council between May 2001 and January 2012. During that time he was the subject of three disciplinary hearings. Allegations against him included allowing a child to sit on his lap and drive his Land Rover, allowing a child to sit in his Land Rover without wearing a seatbelt, and a young person, who had been reported missing by their foster carer, had shown up at his home. The report, which was compiled by an independent social worker, said Smith \"displayed many grooming behaviours during the years he was employed by Pembrokeshire council but there were no direct allegations of abuse during this time\". Smith was dismissed for gross misconduct and in September 2013 a police investigation began after he was accused of sexually abusing a boy. He was jailed for six years in July 2014 after admitting sexually assaulting a child under the age of 13, inciting the child to engage in sexual activity and taking indecent photographs of the child. He also admitted possessing 1,136 indecent images of children. The report said in 2010 Smith had applied to Pembrokeshire council to become a respite foster carer. The fostering team wrote to the Head of Youth Service for his views on Smith's application. The report said the head of service had \"replied in very positive terms\". A formal reference form which the head of service was sent asked him to \"highlight any concerns\" regarding Smith's employment, including any disciplinary proceedings and the outcomes. The head of service left the section blank. It was not until the papers were distributed to the foster panel that one of the members recalled Smith had been investigated previously for inappropriate behaviour with children and had been disciplined. The panel concluded Smith was not suitable for approval to be a foster carer. \"By withholding relevant information and leaving the section of the form blank, the foster panel might have concluded that there had been no concerns and no disciplinary action,\" the report said. \"It was only chance that a member of the fostering panel recollected the safeguarding investigation in 2005\" and \"only luck that prevented Smith from being approved as a foster carer\". There have been calls to make the report public. The latest request took place at full council on 2 March when Cllr Mike Stoddart had put forward a notice of motion asking for it to be published. He said it is in \"the public interest to publish the report so that the electorate can be fully apprised of the chain of events surrounding this issue.\" His motion was defeated by a single vote. A statement from Pembrokeshire council said: \"The report contains personal information in relation to children, parents and professionals, and the report was made available to members on this basis. Further publication of this report was restricted. \"On making the report available to all members, they were made aware that there are families in the area who remain affected by the actions of Mr Smith, and were reminded of their corporate obligation to safeguard everyone in the community.\"",

        "article": "Painted on a classroom wall, high above the modest wooden benches and chalkboards, Moco-Moco primary school's motto reads: \"Onward upward may we ever go\". It serves as a daily reminder that there are opportunities for those who apply themselves diligently at this tiny school of 81 pupils in a remote Amerindian village in Guyana. Sometimes, though, the lack of modern teaching aids is a source of concern for long-time head-teacher Stephen Demetro. \"We have no internet and no computers, so we are at a disadvantage. It makes me feel guilty at national assessment time... we just don't have the resources,\" he said. \"Even the newspapers we get here can be a week late,\" he added, holding up a dated copy of the Stabroek News. Home to 400 Macushi people - one of Guyana's nine Amerindian tribes - Moco-Moco is a sleepy conglomeration of traditional thatched-roof homes. In this part of the Rupununi Savannah, scarlet macaws squawk from palm trees and tapir, deer and paca - which villagers still hunt using bows and arrows - roam wild. Cassava crops, a staple food for millennia, fringe the settlement, which is linked to the nearest town by a long road dotted with potholes. On either side, giant termite mounds hold sway over the windswept plains like silent sentries. Amerindians may have been the first people to inhabit Guyana and they still make up nearly a 10th of the six-race nation's population. But they are also among the country's most marginalised. Sparse infrastructure and employment opportunities are obvious side-effects of life in isolated locations. Some say they are discriminated against as well. Others describe a loss of identity, as a rich culture dating back 11,000 years is gradually eroded. On top of that, there are increased threats to Amerindians' agrarian lifestyle from climate change, and encroachment on their historical land from the mining industry, a bulwark of Guyana's economy. Thomas George, a former \"Toshao\" or village chief of Moco-Moco, says the lack of jobs drives \"young brain-boxes\" to the city, diminishing the community's strength. One plan to combat that is the establishment of a cassava factory to create employment, along with saleable products made from the root vegetables such as tapioca, farine, a type of flour, and cassareep, a popular condiment. But changing weather patterns pose a constant threat to agriculture. \"When we expect sun we get rain, and when we expect rain we get sun. That affects food supplies,\" Mr George said. \"If the season changes and the floods come, it all goes down the drain.\" Indigenous cuisine is something of a dying art in Moco-Moco, as are traditional crafts and even dialect. A recently-opened youth centre aims to teach young Amerindians about their heritage, with classes on everything from the Macushi language to cooking pepperpot - an indigenous meat stew and Guyana's national dish. \"The school follows the national curriculum and that doesn't cater much to indigenous culture,\" Mr Demetro said. \"It's up to teachers to find our own ways of integrating culture into it.\" This year, nearly a billion Guyanese dollars (\u00a34m) has been budgeted by the government for youth training programmes in 106 Amerindian communities across the country, according to Valerie Garrido-Lowe, the junior minister for indigenous people's affairs. \"Parents find it difficult to pay for basic items their children need in secondary school, so many pupils get despondent and leave,\" she said. \"This money will support school dropouts, single parents and young adults who need a second chance in life.\" In addition to remedial maths and English, and vocational skills like joinery, carpentry and dressmaking, participants will have the chance to learn about eco-tourism and hospitality in a bid to woo more visitors to Guyana's pristine hinterlands. \"It's about reviving our culture too,\" said Sydney Allicock, Guyana's first indigenous vice president. \"Tourists are usually sympathetic to Amerindians and are interested in hearing our languages and being part of our activities. We want to share our ecosystem with them. \"This programme will help us teach them about jungle survival and traditional medicine; we'll take them hiking and birdwatching.\" Mr Allicock says the government is also looking into renewable energy, like solar, wind and biogas, to lessen the impacts of global warming. \"We are seeing the effects in river levels, loss of wildlife, and trees losing their fruit because the temperature suddenly changes,\" he said. \"From time immemorial, Amerindians have been the caretakers of the Earth, working alongside nature, yet we are the hardest hit by climate change.\" Read more: South American rivals battle for 'Cinderella county'",

        "article": "Nottingham Forest came from behind to draw with Preston at the City Ground. The visitors led when Simon Makienok finished calmly for his second league goal this season from Greg Cunningham's pass just before the interval. Forest improved after the break and they levelled when Thomas Lam's volley went in via the post and Preston goalkeeper Chris Maxwell. Makienok and Alan Browne forced fine saves from Forest's Vladimir Stojkovic as the match finished level. Forest, who had been hammered 3-0 at rivals Derby on Sunday, started slowly and could have fallen behind in the opening minutes when Stojkovic saved brilliantly from Callum Robinson before later diverting Browne's strike from range onto the post. Nicklas Bendtner should have put the hosts in front when he fired over from Eric Lichaj's cross before Makienok scored just his second league goal of the season. Philippe Montanier changed formation at the break and Forest got the goal their improvement deserved when Lam's shot hit the post before bouncing off Maxwell's heel and into the net. Both teams had chances to win it, with Preston defender Alex Baptiste producing a brilliant goal-line clearance to deny Apostolos Vellios in the dying minutes. Nottingham Forest manager Philippe Montanier told BBC Radio Nottingham: \"We deserved to lose the first half. The first half was awful, but we had a good reaction and a good game in the second half. \"The players showed good determination at the beginning of the second half and after that we were confident.\" Preston manager Simon Grayson told BBC Radio Lancashire: \"If you'd offered us a point before the start of the game, we'd have taken it because you expect Forest to have a reaction from the weekend's result. \"But we knew that if we got after them early on we could put them on the back foot and we did that. \"Overall I thought we had a very, very good first half. You just want to have that extra goal to go in 2-0 possibly at half-time based on how well we'd played. \"Second half, you knew there was going to be a reaction and they changed their system and had a go at us so it's a bit frustrating that we've not won the game, but the way the second half went at times I'm delighted we got another point.\" Match ends, Nottingham Forest 1, Preston North End 1.

        "article": "Elite firms are sidelining the UK's bright working-class applicants in favour of privileged, \"polished\" candidates, a report says. The Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission says these firms draw from a small pool of graduates, who probably went to private or selective schools. This version of talent can be \"mapped to middle-class status\", it adds. The report was based on interviews with staff from 13 elite accountancy, law and financial services firms. The study by Royal Holloway, University of London, on behalf of the commission, examined barriers to entry for people from less privileged backgrounds to these elite firms. It found that despite attempts to improve social inclusion over the past 10 to 15 years, such elite firms continue to be heavily dominated at entry level by people from privileged social backgrounds. The study concluded that elite firms are \"systematically excluding bright working-class applicants\" from their workforce. To break into top jobs, state school candidates needed higher qualifications than privately educated peers, it added. This can be mainly attributed to recruitment methods which targets the Russell Group, which represents 24 UK universities. Some 40% to 50% of job applications to the case study firms were made by applicants who had attended these universities. They received 60% to 70% of all job offers. Candidates from fee-paying and selective schools, which tend to dominate Russell Group universities, made up 70% of graduate trainees at case study firms, despite being only 7% and 4% of the UK population respectively. Firms also used nuanced criteria to help find \"talented\" applicants, the report said. This included factors like the candidate's accent and experiences of travelling. The report said: \"Elite firms define 'talent' according to a number of factors such as drive resilience, string communication skills and above all confidence and 'polish', which participants in the research acknowledge can be mapped to middle-class status and socialisation.\" Commission chairman Alan Milburn, the former Labour health secretary, said: \"This research shows that young people with working-class backgrounds are being systematically locked out of top jobs. Elite firms seem to require applicants to pass a 'poshness test' to gain entry. \"Inevitably that ends up excluding youngsters who have the right sort of grades and abilities but whose parents do not have the right sort of bank balances. \"Thankfully some of our country's leading firms are making a big commitment to recruit the brightest and best, regardless of background.  They should be applauded. But for the rest, this is a wake up and smell the coffee moment.\" David Johnston, chief executive of The Social Mobility Foundation, said the report showed there was \"still a pervasive attitude in some of our professions that all the best people can be found in a very small segment of the country's population\". Prof Les Ebdon, director of Fair Access to Higher Education, said: \"Access to graduate careers should be about your skills and ability to do the job, not about the places you've been, the school you went to or the contacts you have. \"That's why I am encouraging universities to consider how they can best support disadvantaged students as they prepare for life after university.\"",

It was lucky the game was level because otherwise I'm sure it would have been a bit controversial. \"We have to show Reading respect because they are ahead of us in the table. They play a similar passing style to us, so we are wary of them. \"We are hopeful we can get in the play-offs. They are in our way to achieving what we want. We want their play-off spot and are not afraid of talking about it.\" BBC Radio Berkshire's Tim Dellor Reading's meetings with Fulham over the last couple of years have never been dull.

Under the proposals for landlords in England, the Home Office would issue a notice when an asylum application fails that confirms the tenant no longer has the right to rent property. Analysis by legal correspondent Clive Coleman It is currently a criminal offence to remove tenants without a court order. Obtaining that order enables bailiffs to evict tenants. That all takes time. The new measure may cut out court orders, but it is unclear: This will trigger a power for landlords to end the tenancy, without a court order in some circumstances. Landlords will also be required to carry out \"right to rent\" checks on each tenant's immigration status before allowing them to move in, expanding a pilot that has been running for a year in the west Midlands. Repeatedly failing to do either would be a new offence carrying maximum penalties of five years' imprisonment or a fine. A blacklist of \"rogue\" landlords and letting agents will allow councils to keep track of those who have been convicted of housing offences and ban them from renting out properties if they are repeat offenders. Communities Secretary Greg Clark acknowledged that cases in which tenants refused to move out would still end up in court but that the process would be quicker because landlords would have official \"evidence\" to present to the courts of their tenant's status. \"You have saved the landlord having to spend money establishing something that is clear and that the Home Office can provide - which is a clear statement of whether they should be there or not,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Asked whether evicting migrants simply increased the risk of people disappearing altogether, unless immediately detained by the police, Mr Clark said the initiative was part of a \"joined-up system to send people home\". Analysis, by Alicia McCarthy The streets of the UK are not paved with gold. That's the clear message the government wants to send to those tempted to come to Britain illegally. Ministers say the tightening of the demands on private landlords in England is simply the enactment of a manifesto promise to make them carry out the same checks as employers and that migrants need to know there is no right to work or rent a home if you are in the UK illegally. It's not clear yet how the scheme will work or what impact it will have other than moving illegal immigrants from where they are living. And some may suspect the timing of the announcement is a response to the nightly television news pictures showing scores of desperate migrants trying to cross the channel - and to criticism from some that ministers have failed to get a grip on the situation swiftly enough. For Labour, shadow immigration minister David Hanson said he backed tougher checks but said ministers appeared to be \"offloading\" the problem on to landlords and it was up to the authorities to decide whether people should be allowed to remain or deported. Since August 2014, private landlords in five councils - Dudley, Sandwell, Wolverhampton, Walsall and Birmingham - have been required to conduct checks to establish new tenants have the right to rent in the UK or face face a penalty of up to \u00a33,000. Mr Clark said the pilot - introduced as part of the 2014 Immigration Act - had been a success and would be extended across more of the UK, although he could not say how many people had been deported as a direct result. But the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants said the pilot - which has yet to be officially evaluated - had serious shortcomings. \"We have heard that British people with foreign accents are finding it difficult to get tenancies from some of the, you might say, unscrupulous landlords,\" its chief executive Habib Rahman told Radio 4's World at One. And David Smith, from the Residential Landlords Association, said there was evidence of \"document discrimination\" with some landlords reluctant to rent their properties to anyone who could not produce a valid passport.",

        "article": "German Chancellor Angela Merkel is due to meet Vladimir Putin in Russia for the first time since 2015. The meeting, at Mr Putin's summer residence in Sochi, comes at a low point in bilateral relations over the war in Syria and Russia's annexation of Crimea. They are expected to discuss both issues during their meeting - but no breakthroughs are expected. Mr Putin will then meet Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday. Ties between Russia and Germany have worsened since Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea in Ukraine, with Germany being a driving force behind the EU sanctions imposed in response. The pair, who are among the most powerful world leaders, have crossed paths at international summits recently. But this meeting - with the official purpose of discussing the G20 summit of world leaders to be held in Hamburg in July - is the first trip Mrs Merkel has made to Russia in two years. Mrs Merkel wants Russia to seek an end to the conflict in Ukraine by using its influence on pro-Russian separatists, and also needs Moscow's co-operation to bring peace to Syria, the BBC correspondent in Berlin, Damien McGuinness, says. But President Putin equally needs Mrs Merkel's support in to lift the EU's sanctions, our correspondent adds. Mr Putin is also keen to hear her opinion of US President Donald Trump, whom she recently met. The pair spoke frequently before the breakdown in communications since 2014, and were said to have a grudging respect for one another. She speaks Russian, having grown up in communist East Germany, and he speaks German, from his years working for the KGB in Dresden in the 1980s. Russian news outlet Tass said the pair would discuss terrorism, the Middle East, and the Minsk agreements on the Ukraine crisis, quoting a Kremlin press source. But both sides have downplayed the prospect of major breakthroughs during their meeting in Sochi. Germany remains critical of Russia's actions in Crimea in 2014, and the two leaders stand opposed on the war in Syria. The German domestic intelligence agency has also accused Russia of being behind a series of cyber attacks on state computer systems. In contrast, Mr Putin's scheduled meeting with the Turkish president the following day comes at a time of increased co-operation between the two nations. While they back opposing sides in Syria's civil war - with Moscow supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and Ankara his opponents - the two countries began carrying out joint air strikes against the so-called Islamic State in January. The joint operation came a little over a year after Turkey shot down a Russian military jet, resulting in a crisis in bilateral relations. US President Donald Trump is also scheduled to speak to President Putin by phone on Tuesday, the White House announced Monday night. They are expected to discuss the war in Syria.",

Mr Jammeh has been given until noon on Friday to leave office or be forced out by UN-backed regional forces. Troops have been told to halt their advance until the deadline passes. The Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) is acting in support of Adama Barrow, who was sworn in as the new Gambian president on Thursday. His legitimacy as president, after winning last month's election, has been recognised internationally. Last-ditch mediation talks, led by Guinea's President Alpha Conde, are due on Friday morning. Chairman of the Ecowas commission, Marcel Alain de Souza, said that if the meeting with Mr Conde proved unsuccessful, militarily action would follow. \"If by midday, he [Mr Jammeh] doesn't agree to leave The Gambia under the banner of President Conde, we really will intervene militarily,\" he said. Ecowas said that its forces had encountered no resistance after entering The Gambia on Thursday. Troops from Senegal and other West African countries crossed into The Gambia after an initial deadline for Mr Jammeh to stand down passed with his resignation. Mr Barrow, who remains in Senegal, has said that he will not return to Gambia's capital, Banjul, until the military operation had ended. The threat by the West African regional bloc Ecowas to remove Mr Jammeh by force is supported by the 15-member UN Security Council, although the council has stressed that a political solution should be the priority. A Senegalese army spokesman, Col Abdou Ndiaye, told the BBC that troops who were now in The Gambia were prepared to fight if necessary. \"It is already war, if we find any resistance, we will fight it,\" he said, adding: \"If there are people who are fighting for the former president, we will fight them.\" But Col Ndiaye said the main goal of Ecowas was to restore democracy and to allow the newly-elected president to take power. In his inaugural speech at the Gambian embassy in Senegal's capital, Dakar, President Barrow ordered all members of The Gambia's armed forces to remain in their barracks. Any found found illegally bearing arms would be considered \"rebels\", he said. After first accepting defeat he reversed his position and said he would not step down. He declared a 90-day state of emergency, blaming irregularities in the electoral process. The electoral commission accepted that some of its early results had contained errors but said they would not have affected Mr Barrow's win. Mr Jammeh has said he will stay in office until new elections are held. Remaining in power would also give him protection against prosecution for alleged abuses committed during his rule.",

Pop Recs Ltd hosted in-store gigs by acts from Franz Ferdinand to James Bay. It also earned the group an award for Britain's hardest-working band from the Association of Independent Music. Drummer Dave Harper, who runs the shop, is now looking for a new site. \"We need to be somewhere else,\" he said. \"Not existing is not an option.\" The band opened Pop Recs Ltd to sell their own album in 2013 after realising there were few bricks-and-mortar stores left to sell it. Housed in the city's former tourist information office, it was originally only meant to be open for a few weeks. But the band kept it going and their DIY attempts to buck a music industry decline gained support from other independent artists. It also became a community hub, hosting regular music tuition plus poetry, stitching and toddler groups. Now, however, they have moved out after Sunderland City Council, which owned the building, sold it for student flats. Pulled Apart By Horses played the shop's final gig on Saturday. Harper said he was looking at one possible new premises, and that comments from the shop's regulars had made him realise it was important to reopen. Things like the poetry group, which has 40 members, and the Saturday morning \"stitch and bitch\", will \"stop happening here\", Harper said. \"That's absolutely terrifying because, if you walk around this city, and if you don't want baked pastry goods or go to a charity shop or cash a cheque or put a bet on, I don't know what people do. \"I'm standing here with grease on my hands and I hadn't cried for years until I realised this place was done, and people were saying pleasant things about it. It's really driven home so acutely what this place has meant to people.\" Members of shop's the regular meetings have told him that the groups help with their mental health problems, he said. \"They feel comfortable here and they don't feel comfortable anywhere else that's state sponsored or medication related,\" he said. \"I didn't know we were doing this. \"People have just come and told us recently, and that was infinitely more upsetting, yet satisfying, that we were achieving things we didn't even realise under our own noses.\" The band have always known the council was trying to sell the building, Sunderland City Council's cabinet secretary Councillor Mel Speding said. \"That has now been secured with its development into student accommodation. \"This is in line with council objectives to see more people living and working in the city centre and, in the interests of council tax payers in these financially challenging times for local authorities, it secures a capital receipt. \"Naturally, with the success and popularity of Pop Recs, the council and others have been looking at ways and means of continuing and securing a similar venture elsewhere in the city centre.\"",

        "article": "The football bureaucrats of the world were probably expecting to make global headlines as they gathered for the Fifa Congress in Zurich. But the news so far has been bigger - and worse - than they can possibly have imagined. The US investigation into corruption at the highest levels of the world's most popular game will have far-reaching implications for how the game is run - and who runs it. As news of arrests at the top of Fifa began to sink in, the organisation said it was planning to go ahead as scheduled with the election of its president - which was expected to result once again in a kind of coronation for Sepp Blatter, the great survivor of world sports administration. But there's another item on the agenda too - one that may still be troubling delegates far into the future when Mr Blatter is eventually gone and the corruption story has played itself out. The Palestinian delegation wants Fifa to suspend Israel from world football. This is not just about sport of course. The Palestinians are pursuing a strategy they call \"internationalisation\" - which means bringing their grievances against Israel into as many international arenas as possible. And arenas don't come any bigger than Fifa. The issue has been raised in previous years but some sort of deal was worked out to prevent the issue from coming to a vote. This time the head of the Palestinian Football Association (PFA), Jibril Rajoub, says nothing will persuade him to remove the request from Fifa's formal agenda. There won't be any backroom deals - there will be a vote. \"I am going to end the suffering and the humiliation of the Palestinian footballers,\" he told me. \"It is our right.\" The Palestinians believe their case is strong. They complain about how police and army checkpoints which restrict freedom of movement around the occupied Palestinian Territory of the West Bank hamper the ability of players and officials to get to games. The point is illustrated in a video presentation in which a middle-aged Palestinian called Farouq Assi is captured on the cameras of a human rights activist blindfolded, handcuffed and in custody at an Israeli checkpoint in the West Bank. It's not a rare event. It's in the presentation because Mr Assi is a football referee and he was on his way to take charge of a game in Jericho when he was detained. The match was abandoned. Palestinian territory is divided into two parts - Gaza and the West Bank. Israel controls all movement into and out of the West Bank through a series of checkpoints and it maintains strict controls at its crossing with Gaza through which players and officials have to travel to play West Bank teams. Israeli sports officials argue they have no control over the policies applied at those checkpoints by Israeli security and intelligence agencies. Mr Blatter made a trip to Israel and the Palestinian Territories ahead of the Fifa Congress in what appears to have been a failed attempt to stop the issue from being pushed to a vote. Not long after he left an incident at an Israeli-controlled border crossing with Jordan illustrated the problem. The Palestinian national team was leaving through the checkpoint on its way to play an overseas fixture - it flies through Amman in Jordan, a short drive across the desert rather than from Israel's main airport in Tel Aviv. As they were leaving there were reports that one of their players, Sameh Maarabe, had been arrested by Israeli officials. Israel explained later that Maarabe had been convicted last year of using an overseas trip to smuggle money and messages back into the West Bank on behalf of the militant group Hamas. To Palestinians that's a story about the harassment of a footballer - to Israelis it's about issuing a warning about re-offending to someone who has a criminal record and who happens to be a footballer. There are other grievances too - including the presence on Occupied Palestinian Territory of teams from Jewish settlements which are allowed to play in the Israeli league. But Israel feels it has a positive story to tell about sport. There are Arab players in the Israeli national team and at most top-flight clubs - although there is an exception in that Beitar Jerusalem has often attracted criticism for the racism of its nationalist fans. Former English Premier League star Yossi Benayoun, who's arguably Israel's best-ever player, told me: \"Sport is one of the only things that brings people together. In my experience I played with Muslims, Christians and any other religion and it's the same in Israel - during my time in the national team we always played with Arab players and it was the same for them. \"I hope it doesn't come to this decision, because it's nothing to do with sport.\" For now the Israeli sports authorities have left their argument at that, but not everyone in Israel has been so diplomatic. The well-connected Israeli legal campaign group Shurat HaDin, for example, has drawn attention to Jibril Rajoub's membership of the central committee of the Fatah movement, which has an armed wing. It has found several militaristic quotes from Mr Rajoub talking about the Palestinian conflict with Israel and has written to Fifa demanding that he should be expelled, instead of the Israel Football Association (IFA). Their letter is an illustration of the fear inside football that giving in to one expulsion request is bound to trigger others - what if Ukraine should demand the suspension of Russia over the annexation of Crimea for example, when the Russians are scheduled to host the next World Cup? Within the world of sport there's always a tendency to keep difficult issues at bay by arguing that sport and politics don't mix - but of course in extreme cases they do. Both apartheid-era South Africa and the now-vanished Yugoslavia led by Slobodan Milosevic were expelled from international bodies - the Palestinian chances of success at Fifa will depend on persuading enough delegates that their case matches those precedents. Israel for now seems confident - partly because Sepp Blatter has clarified that the rules for suspension require a 75% majority, and partly because, in the words of the Israeli expert on international law Alan Baker, this is \"a familiar grievance in a new forum\". The dramatic arrests which overshadowed the start of the Fifa Congress may have shifted the spotlight from the Palestinian case for now but this is an issue that won't go away. Whatever happens to the proposal in 2015, there is nothing to stop the Palestinians from putting it back on football's agenda in the future.",

It wants to redress the balance from the university's walls being lined with pictures of \"dead white males\" by adding more women and ethnic minorities. The portraits include broadcasters Dame Esther Rantzen and Reeta Chakrabarti. Oxford's head of equality Trudy Coe said it was \"sending a signal\". This commissioning of portraits is one of the biggest projects by the university to create a more diverse range of people portrayed in its public places - including more women, people from ethnic minorities, gays and lesbians and people with disabilities. The university faced a high-profile controversy last year over whether a statue of Cecil Rhodes should be removed - after claims that the Victorian colonialist's attitudes on race made him an unsuitable figure to be commemorated. The new pictures on the ancient walls will include scientist Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell and author Jeanette Winterson. There will also be some men, including film maker Ken Loach. \"We're not taking anyone down - but the portraits have been almost exclusively men and we're just beginning to redress the balance,\" says Ms Coe, head of the university's equality and diversity unit. \"It will allow students to look up and see people who look like them. It's sending a signal to a wider range of students that they belong here,\" she says. Ms Coe says the new pictures will reflect the modern reality of university life - and the people who have been painted or photographed have been nominated by current staff and students. The people depicted have links with the university - such as being former students or academic staff - with the criteria that they were examples of excellence and widened the range of pictures from the \"narrow and traditional\" and \"challenged stereotypes\". Among the people to be represented will be criminologist and disability rights campaigner, Marie Tidball. \"Symbols are important,\" she said. There are millions of people with a disability in the UK, Ms Tidball said, but they have a \"lack of visibility in public spaces\". The commissioning of a picture of an academic with a disability was a \"very significant\" step towards making sure that all kinds of students could feel at home at the university, she said. \"I really hope that this speaks to kids now doing their GCSEs,\" said Ms Tidball. And she rejected suggestions of an excess of political correctness as \"absolute nonsense\". BBC journalist Reeta Chakrabarti said it was a project which reflected the university's current staff and living alumni. These are people who are \"alive and kicking, a representation of modern day Britain,\" she said. \"You could just continue to portray the same people, but it wouldn't be a reflection of how the university and society have changed,\" she said. \"Different ages, different societies celebrate different values.\" As a student at Oxford, she said \"there weren't many people there who were like me, from my sort of background\". But she had an \"overwhelmingly positive experience\" and \"nothing about Oxford made me feel out of place\". Oxford University has faced questions about whether it is admitting enough poorer students and state-school pupils. Admissions figures published earlier this year showed that Oxford had one of the lowest proportions of state school pupils of any UK university. This showed that universities such as Bristol, Durham and Cambridge were admitting a higher proportion of state school pupils than Oxford. The new portraits:",

And yet it wasn't on the agenda when EU defence ministers met in Slovakia and barely anyone is talking about the idea. There are no plans for legions of Eurotroops decked out in helmets emblazoned with yellow stars on a blue background. UK will oppose plan for 'EU army' Juncker proposes EU military HQ Brexit vote revives EU army dream It's difficult, indeed pointless, to oppose something that doesn't exist and isn't being suggested. But that's the problem with the argument over the EU's future military capabilities; for now it's a battle of semantics, a war of words. Instead the official agenda here in Bratislava spoke of \"the EU Global Strategy and its synergies and sequencing with the Commission-led EDAP\". But for Sir Michael Fallon there's already much to dislike. France and Germany presented proposals that would include joint development of military hardware such as helicopters and drones, expanding the EU's peace-keeping missions and, most contentiously of all, establishing a permanent joint European military HQ. \"We will continue to oppose any kind of duplication like that, or any unnecessary bureaucracy that cuts across the primary mechanism for defending Europe, which is Nato,\" Mr Fallon told reporters. He was by no means alone in opposing such \"bureaucratic duplication\", he said. Germany insists that the idea has nothing to do with a European army. \"It is not aimed against Nato,\" said Defence Minister Ursula Von der Leyen. \"On the contrary, we need a strong Europe and whatever strengthens Europe in defence also strengthens Nato.\" And those words were underlined by Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, who told reporters at the meeting that there was \"no contradiction between strong European defence and a strong Nato\".  The importance lay in avoiding duplication, he said. When he stepped out of the meeting, the UK defence secretary said that 12 countries had spoken and half were against the EU military headquarters, including Sweden, the Netherlands, Poland, Latvia and Lithuania. The BBC couldn't immediately verify that. EU foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini said after the informal summit that \"in our three hours discussion on this topic with all the ministers, I never heard once the word 'veto', I never heard once the word 'blocking', and I never heard once the word 'army',\" she said. Primarily Sir Michael said he remained sceptical about European willingness to stump up the cash for new defence projects when only a handful of European countries met their existing defence budget obligations to Nato. \"The real issue is whether they're prepared to step up to the 2% (of GDP on defence spending) as we already have,\" Mr Fallon told reporters. \"There are half a dozen of them in that room who don't spend 1%,\" he said, explaining why he was cool towards Europe's common defence ambitions. \"Europe is full of Eurosceptics now.

        "article": "The Queen has described Chinese officials as having been \"very rude\" during last October's state visit to the UK by President Xi Jinping. At a Buckingham Palace garden party in pouring rain on Tuesday, the Queen commented, \"Oh, bad luck\"  when told a Metropolitan Police commander had led the police operation around the Chinese leader's visit. The Queen's unguarded comments are atypical for her, but also pose some unanswered questions about the visit. In short, we don't know. Police Commander Lucy D'Orsi was \"seriously, seriously undermined by the Chinese\", according to the Lord Chamberlain, who introduced her to the Queen. Commander D'Orsi said it \"was quite a testing time\" and that \"they walked out of Lancaster House and told me that the trip was off\". The Queen clearly knew all about the incident concerned and interjected: \"They were very rude to the ambassador.\" \"They walked out on both of us,\" replied Ms D'Orsi. Did Ms D'Orsi mean that Chinese officials threatened to cancel the whole state visit? Or just part of the itinerary? Was any conflict to do with security arrangements (as Ms D'Orsi was clearly under pressure) or of wider diplomatic significance? We simply do not know. The police have not issued any statement. President Xi and his wife Madame Peng were guests of the Queen and Prince Philip at Buckingham Palace for the state visit so perhaps it is to be expected that the Queen would be aware of such details. The Metropolitan Police had to defend itself from human rights groups' accusations that it dealt inappropriately with protesters during Mr Xi's visit in October 2015. Commander D'Orsi issued a statement in the immediate aftermath of the visit saying she was disappointed at hearing the view expressed that the Met was \"working to the bidding of the Chinese to suppress protest\". The Queen's comments were picked up by the microphone of the camera filming the garden party event, operated by Peter Wilkinson, the monarch's official cameraman His footage was released to broadcasters under the \"pool\" arrangement which is standard procedure for royal events (to avoid all broadcasters sending their own crews to every engagement). It was only then that the uncharacteristically undiplomatic comments were spotted. Indeed. At the time Mr Xi said he believed his visit would lift UK-China relations to a \"new height\". Buckingham Palace would not comment on a \"private conversation\" but said all parties worked closely to ensure the visit proceeded smoothly. Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lu Kang said the president's trip to the UK was very successful and \"marked the start of the Golden Era between China and the UK\". We now know, thanks to the Queen's comments, that it was a testing time behind the scenes, at least for the police commander and the British ambassador to China. However, that does not mean that overall the trip was not a success. Kerry Brown, Professor of Chinese Studies at King's College London, and a former senior British diplomat in Beijing, told the BBC that it was striking that even someone with the Queen's six decades of diplomatic experience still found dealing with the Chinese protocols and machinery tough: \"In terms of the atmospherics between diplomats in China and the UK, it's not an easy relationship and that comes through in the freight of emotion that was in her comments.\" At the moment, there is no coverage whatsoever of this in mainland China, says BBC Monitoring's China Media Analyst Kerry Allen. \"This is not unusual. The comments the Queen made will be regarded as highly embarrassing by China's elite, as the concept of 'maintaining face' - one's sense of dignity or prestige - is incredibly important within the country,\" she says. \"Owing to the sensitivity of her comments, state media will be required to hold off covering this until the government decides what official response to give. \"Some users of popular microblogs like Sina Weibo though are commenting on it and quickly gaining responses. However, the censors are catching up and censoring comments to limit impact.\" The BBC's World News TV channel goes temporarily to black in China whenever the story about Mr Xi's visit is mentioned.

        "article": "A top English player deserves to make \u00a31m a year, says players' union boss Damian Hopley. Media playback is not supported on this device The new pay deal with the Rugby Football Union (RFU) means an England international will earn up to \u00a3300,000 each year in match fees alone. Along with their club salaries, bonuses and commercial income, an elite player could soon top seven figures per year. \"The market place dictates what they deserve,\" Rugby Players' Association chief executive Hopley told BBC Sport. \"If players are successful and conduct themselves in a way that is becoming to that role model status, then I think they do deserve it.\" The latest RFU accounts showed record profits following the 2015 Rugby World Cup. \"The players generate huge amounts of money for the game,\" Hopley added. \"In the context of the revenues being generated through English rugby, it's a very reasonable deal. \"We wanted to ensure that the players felt they were participating in the commercial upside of the RFU - and despite a disappointing World Cup for everyone, we have seen a fantastic year around English rugby revenues. \"England players in 2003 won \u00a370,000 each for winning the World Cup, while players in this Old Mutual Wealth Series will pick up more than that for playing in four games for England.\" Mark Lambert, the vice-chairman of the RPA, denies that the new deal will lead to a disconnect between elite England players and the rest. \"The way you earn respect as a rugby player is the way you carry yourself, the way you behave, and the example you set for other people,\" the Harlequins prop told BBC Sport. \"All the [Harlequins] guys that have come through the system and gone on to represent England internationally, they are model professionals and deserve what they have achieved in the game. \"We would all like to be earning that money, but it's something that's directly linked to the revenues of the RFU,\" added Lambert, who has made more than 200 top-flight appearances for Quins. \"The RFU make a lot of money and it's only right the England players get that. There is potential for players to make a good amount of money, but you have to put in that hard work first in order to get there.\" The RPA last week held its quarterly board meeting with a variety of issues on the agenda, from artificial pitches to the new rugby calendar. Hopley says the players' union would fully support the notion of a fallow summer in the calendar post-2019, as revealed by the BBC in September, adding: \"The players' voice is on the rise, and rightly so.\" Lambert said: \"It is more important than ever that the players have a strong voice. \"The game is expanding, there is a lot of money and there is lot of opportunity - and we need to make sure the player doesn't get pulled in too many directions. \"It's an exciting time, but we have got to make sure the game stays the same at its core.\"",

        "article": "England's Tommy Fleetwood is one shot off Brian Harman's lead going into Sunday's final round of the US Open. Fleetwood shot a four-under-par 68 to keep pace with fellow overnight leader Brooks Koepka at Erin Hills, while Harman carded a 67 to lead on 12 under. Paul Casey, who also started on seven under, fell away with a three-over 75. Justin Thomas is tied for second after becoming the first man to shoot a nine-under-par round at the US Open and the fifth 63 in its 117-year history. There had been four other 63s in US Open history before this week. Jonny Miller hit the first on the par-71 Oakmont in 1973, while Jack Nicklaus and Tom Weiskopf's efforts came on the par-70 Baltusrol in 1980. Fiji's Vijay Singh also recorded a seven-under 63, at Olympia Fields in 2003. The US Open tournament organisers have historically prided themselves on trying to make the winning score as close to level par as possible. However, heavy overnight rain dumped an inch of water on the course and that undoubtedly helped low scoring with players able to take advantage of receptive greens and attack the holes. Thomas opened his round with two birdies before dropping a shot on the fourth. Four more birdies followed on the front nine before another bogey on the 10th looked to have put paid to his chances of breaking Miller's 44-year-old record. But after three birdies in six holes, he eagled the 667-yard par-five 18th, hitting his second shot to eight feet from 300 yards and rolling in the downhill putt. Southport's Fleetwood, who finished tied for 27th on his only other US Open appearance in 2015, appeared to be heading towards his second bogey-free round of the tournament after laying up with his second shot on the par-five 18th. However, he left his chip to the green short and then putted through the green and off it with his fourth shot. A sublime chip to three feet allowed him to escape with just his third bogey of the week. \"That was the best shot I hit all day,\" Fleetwood told BBC Sport. \"I hadn't been out of position all day and suddenly I was staring double bogey in the face. \"Bad shots make bogeys and 18 was a good example. I could still have been there now, hitting the ball over the green. But I hit the perfect shot and I was made up when I got on the green. \"Three days down and so far so good.\" Fellow Englishman Casey was one of the four overnight leaders but he fared the worst, posting a triple bogey for the second day running as he dropped out of contention. His downfall began with an errant second shot on the par-four third into deep rough. That led to a seven and a further shot went on the next hole. On Friday, the 39-year-old responded with a run of five successive birdies but he was unable to replicate that on Saturday, as he ended the round on four under par. Home players occupy 12 of the top 16 places on the leaderboard and with six shots separating them, any one could still win on Sunday. None of the dozen have won a major, and neither have the four non-Americans (Fleetwood, Kim Si-woo, Bernd Wiesberger and Hideki Matsuyama). Harman, who is bidding to become the first left-hander to win the US Open, knocked in six birdies. The 30-year-old, who won the Wells Fargo tournament last month, said: \"I've been striking the ball so well and giving myself chances so I'll just try to keep doing what I've been doing. \"I'll definitely think about the mindset I had in winning Wells Fargo a few weeks ago.\" Big-hitting Koepka, who averaged 320 yards with his driver on Saturday, had five birdies in his four-under round. Rickie Fowler had a run of three successive birdies from the 14th as the leader from the first round shot a four-under 68 to get to 10 under and just two off the lead. Patrick Reed's seven-under 65 featured eight birdies and one bogey as he improved to eight under. He said he felt like he \"hit the ball better\" in Friday's second round, despite taking 10 fewer strokes on Saturday. Reed explained: \"I was really seeing the lines and had the speed. And most of my birdie putts were uphill and I could attack. On Friday it was the opposite.\" Russell Henley (67) and Charley Hoffman (68) are all in a group four off the lead on eight under. However, not all Americans fared well. Jordan Spieth, the 2015 champion, started the day level par and was still on that mark after a couple of birdies cancelled out two bogeys in his opening 11 holes. Two more bogeys followed though and a double-bogey on the par-five 18th saw him finish four-over after a 76. \"It's been an off-week for me with the putting,\" said the former world number one. \"I've been striking the ball well. \"It's just been trying to figure it out on and around the greens. And I feel like once the can gets open, I'll start pouring them in.\" Germany's Martin Kaymer, winner in 2014, took 41 shots to complete the front nine and although he picked up two birdies on the back nine, his three-over 75 saw him drop back to level par. And two-time winner Ernie Els, who was two under after round one, dropped five shots in his opening six holes on Saturday. The South African rallied with an eagle two on the par-four 15th but had a triple-bogey seven on the 17th to drop to five over after a 79. England's Eddie Pepperell, 26, had five birdies and two bogeys in his three-under-par 69 to get to four under and remain in with a chance. After dropping three shots in his opening six holes, Matt Fitzpatrick holed five birdies in eight holes to post a two-under 70 to climb to three under. Fellow Englishman Andrew Johnston mixed three birdies with four bogeys as he slipped back to one under with a 73. And Scotland's Martin Laird is putting together a solid tournament with nine birdies and nine bogeys in his opening three rounds. However, it looks like Lee Westwood's wait to win a major will go on to The Open in July. The Englishman was three under after round one, but he followed Friday's 75 with another 75 today to drop to three over. More to follow.",

        "article": "Scientists in the United States are trying to grow human organs inside pigs. They have injected human stem cells into pig embryos to produce human-pig embryos known as chimeras. The embryos are part of research aimed at overcoming the worldwide shortage of transplant organs. The team from University of California, Davis says they should look and behave like normal pigs except that one organ will be composed of human cells. The human-pig chimeric embryos are being allowed to develop in the sows for 28 days before the pregnancies are terminated and the tissue removed for analysis. The BBC's Panorama was given access to the research for Medicine's Big Breakthrough: Editing Your Genes. Creating the chimeric embryos takes two stages. First, a technique known as CRISPR gene editing is used to remove DNA from a newly fertilised pig embryo that would enable the resulting foetus to grow a pancreas. This creates a genetic \"niche\" or void. Then, human induced pluripotent (iPS) stem cells are injected into the embryo. The iPS cells were derived from adult cells and \"dialled back\" to become stem cells capable of developing into any tissue in the body. The team at UC Davis hopes the human stem cells will take advantage of the genetic niche in the pig embryo and the resulting foetus will grow a human pancreas. Gene editing technique could transform future Pablo Ross, a reproductive biologist who is leading the research told me: \"Our hope is that this pig embryo will develop normally but the pancreas will be made almost exclusively out of human cells and could be compatible with a patient for transplantation.\" But the work is controversial. Last year, the main US medical research agency, the National Institutes of Health, imposed a moratorium on funding such experiments. The main concern is that the human cells might migrate to the developing pig's brain and make it, in some way, more human. Pablo Ross says this is unlikely but is a key reason why the research is proceeding with such caution: \"We think there is very low potential for a human brain to grow, but this is something we will be investigating.\" His team has previously injected human stem cells into pig embryos but without first creating the genetic niche. Prof Ross said although they later found human cells in several parts of the developing foetus, they \"struggled to compete\" with the pig cells. By deleting a key gene involved in the creation of the pig pancreas, they hope the human cells will have more success creating a human-like pancreas. Other teams in the United States have created human-pig chimeric embryos but none has allowed the foetuses to be born. Walter Low, professor in the department of neurosurgery, University of Minnesota, said pigs were an ideal \"biological incubator\" for growing human organs, and could potentially be used to create not just a pancreas but hearts, livers, kidneys, lungs and corneas. He said if the iPS cells were taken from a patient needing a transplant then these could be injected in a pig embryo which had the key genes deleted for creating the required organ, such as the liver: \"The organ would be an exact genetic copy of your liver but a much younger and healthier version and you would not need to take immunosuppressive drugs which carry side-effects.\" But Prof Low stressed that the research, using another form of gene editing called TALENs, was still at the preliminary stages, trying to identify the target genes which must be removed in order to prevent the pig from developing a particular organ. His team is also trying to create dopamine-producing human neurons from chimeric embryos to treat patients with Parkinson's disease. These embryos have been allowed to develop for up to 62 days - the normal gestation period is around 114 days. Like the team in California, Prof Low said they were monitoring the effects on the pig brain: \"With every organ we will look at what's happening in the brain and if we find that it's too human like, then we won't let those foetuses be born\". Gene editing has revitalised research into xenotransplantation, and the concept of using animal organs for humans. In the mid-90s there were hopes that genetically modified pigs might provide an endless supply of organs for patients, and that cross-species transplants were not far off. But clinical trials stalled because of fears that humans might be infected with animal viruses. Last year, a team at Harvard Medical School used CRISPR gene editing to remove more than 60 copies of a pig retrovirus. Prof George Church, who led the research, told me:  \"It opens up the possibility of not just transplantation from pigs to humans but the whole idea that a pig organ is perfectible. \"Gene editing could ensure the organs are very clean, available on demand and healthy, so they could be superior to human donor organs.\" But organisations campaigning for an end to factory farming are dismayed at the thought of organ farms. Peter Stevenson, from Compassion in World Farming, told me: \"I'm nervous about opening up a new source of animal suffering.  Let's first get many more people to donate organs.  If there is still a shortage after that, we can consider using pigs, but on the basis that we eat less meat so that there is no overall increase in the number of pigs being used for human purposes.\" In Greek mythology, chimeras were fire-breathing monsters composed of several animals - part lion, goat and snake. The scientific teams believe human-pig chimeras should look and behave like normal pigs except that one organ will be composed of human cells. Scott Fahrenkrug, whose Minnesota-based company Recombinetics is teaming up on the chimera research with Prof Low, told me: \"Perhaps the term chimera is going to take on a new meaning and it will be one that's much more affectionate: chimeras will be seen to be what they are which is a saviour, given that they will provide, life-saving, sustaining organs for our patients.\" Seven thousand people in the UK are on the transplant waiting list and hundreds die each year before a donor can be found. Panorama - Medicine's Big Breakthrough: Editing Your Genes will be shown on BBC1 at 20.30 BST on Monday 6 June 2016 and will be available afterwards on BBC iPlayer",

There have been calls for Carroll, 27, to make an international return after his recent hat-trick against Arsenal. But Hodgson said: \"Every time someone scores a goal and he's English it is 'why is he not playing for England?' \"I'm certainly not going to pick him on the basis that he scored a hat-trick so therefore has to be in the England team.\" Ex-Newcastle and Liverpool forward Carroll has scored two goals in nine England appearances, but has not featured for the national side since October 2012. Tottenham's Harry Kane, the Premier League's top-scorer with 22 goals this season, and Leicester striker Jamie Vardy, who has netted 21 times, have established themselves in the England set-up and both played in last month's friendlies against Germany and the Netherlands.

Asghar Buksh, 55, repeatedly struck mother-of-six Nasreen Buksh over the head with a heavy blunt object which has never been found. He admitted culpable homicide on the basis of diminished responsibility after saying he had no recollection of the killing at Dixon Avenue, Glasgow, on 24 September last year. Buksh will be sentenced on 27 June. The High Court in Glasgow heard that 43-year-old Mrs Buksh died after being struck on the head at least five times. Pathologists told the court that the lack of defensive injuries and the position of her body suggested she was assaulted as she slept. Following the attack, Buksh went to Cathcart Police Station and told an officer: \"I've come to hand myself in. I think my wife's dead. I hit her on the head. I did it.\" The court was told that three psychiatrists described Buksh as suffering from an acute stress disorder at the time. Prosecutor Gordon Lamont said: \"The accused and his wife had been married for 25 years, but over the last 10 or 11 years their relationship appears to have broken down and they became increasingly estranged, albeit, still residing under the one roof. \"They slept separately and Mrs Buksh routinely slept on the sofa in the living room. Their children report that they barely spoke to each other.\" Mr Lamont said the problems in the marriage intensified after Mrs Buksh went to Pakistan on holiday in May last year. He said she had become involved with another man and was making plans to move to Pakistan. The court also heard that two days before he killed his wife, Buksh went to Paisley Police Office and spoke with a support officer saying he feared his wife was going to take their youngest child, aged 10, to Pakistan and not return. He also made an emergency doctor's appointment and said he was suffering from stress and not sleeping. He was prescribed medication for stress. Defence counsel Sarah Livingstone said: \"My client has no memory of this incident.

It came as 100 writers protested outside the council, demanding it take measures to protect freedom of speech. Several writers have returned their awards to the council in recent weeks, protesting against what they call rising intolerance in India. The Akademi has condemned \"any atrocity against any writer\" in India, and urged writers to take back their awards. In recent weeks, growing numbers of writers have been protesting against book bans, the silencing of writers like Perumal Murugan following attacks by right-wing groups, and the killings of rationalists such as Malleshappa Kalburgi and Govind Pansare this year. The Akademi had been criticised for not speaking out against the attacks sooner, with over 40 writers returning their awards to protest the institution's \"silence\" on the \"attacks against dissent\". Akademi president Vishwanath Prasad Tiwari had earlier called the protest \"illogical\", but accepted a memorandum on Friday from the writers, who held a silent march to the institution's headquarters. The Akademi then later issued a statement condemning \"any atrocity against any writer anywhere in the country in the strongest of words\". It also condemned the killing of rationalist Kalburgi \"and other intellectuals and thinkers\", and called on \"governments at the centre and in the states to take immediate action to bring the culprits to book and to ensure the security of writers now and in the future\".

        "article": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and what is now known as the World Bank,  were set up to manage the post-World War II global economy. They were conceived in 1944 at a conference in Bretton Woods, in the US state of New Hampshire. By fostering economic cooperation and helping countries with balance of payments problems the founders hoped to avoid a repeat of the 1930s Great Depression. The IMF aims to preserve economic stability and to tackle - or ideally prevent - financial crises. Over time, its focus has switched to the developing world. The World Bank's predecessor - the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development - was set up to drive post-war recovery. Now, it is the world's leading development organisation, working for growth and poverty reduction. Owned by the governments of its 187 member states, the Bank channels loans and grants and advises low and middle-income countries. The IMF is funded by a charge - known as a \"quota\" - paid by member nations. The quota is based on a country's wealth and it determines voting power within the organisation; those making higher contributions have greater voting rights. The IMF acts as a lender of last resort, disbursing its foreign exchange reserves for short periods to any member in difficulties. Since they were conceived, the IMF has been run by a European and the World Bank by a US national. The IMF and the Bank have served as a rallying point for disparate causes - from environmentalists to anarchists - and meetings have occasionally been accompanied by violent street protests. Protesters and critics cite the exploitation of the poor and the environment and argue that freer trade threatens the livelihoods of millions of people. The IMF has admitted that forcing developing countries to open their markets to foreign investors can increase the risk of financial crises. Its former managing director Horst Koehler said in 2002 that the benefits of globalisation had not been equally shared. But he added that \"the objective should not be less globalisation but more and better globalisation.\" Conceived: Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, USA Date: 1944 Headquarters:  Washington DC IMF-World Bank membership: 187 countries World Bank staff: 10,000 IMF staff: 2,500 IMF managing director: Christine Lagarde Christine Lagarde is the first woman to head the IMF in the 65 years of the organisation's history. She trained as a lawyer and for more than two decades worked for a Chicago-based international law firm, where she specialised in major labour and anti-trust cases. She served as French trade minister from 2005 to 2007, when she was made finance minister, becoming the first woman to hold such a post in any of the G8 major industrial countries. Ms Lagarde took over the helm of the IMF in July 2011 at a time when the organisation was facing some extremely tough challenges, with the eurozone in a state of deep crisis and fears looming that countries such as Greece could default on their loans. Never afraid of speaking her mind, she has blamed the 2008 worldwide financial crisis partly on the male-dominated, testosterone-fuelled culture at global banks. She is viewed with high regard in the international arena and in 2009 was named best finance minister in Europe by the Financial Times. She has pledged to improve diversity at the IMF and to push ahead with reforms to give emerging economies more influence in the organisation. She took over after the previous head, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who had to resign over charges of sexual assault. He has subsequently been cleared. World Bank president: Jim Yong Kim Jim Yong Kim was chosen as the new president of the World Bank in April 2012. The Korean-American health expert was president of Dartmouth College in the US state of New Hampshire. He faced a strong challenge for the post, which has traditionally gone to an American, from Nigerian Finance Minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala. Dr Kim succeeded Robert Zoellick is serving a five-year term. Jim Yong Kim is a doctor lauded for his pioneering role in treating HIV/Aids and reducing the impact of tuberculosis in the developing world. The IMF and World Bank attempt to help countries or regions in economic turmoil - and often act as a lender of last resort for nation-states. Past interventions by the IMF have included providing funds for countries caught up in the 1997 Asian financial crisis, and loans to help South American countries such as Argentina and Brazil stave off debt default crises. In October 2008, the IMF activated an emergency funding scheme for countries facing economic distress resulting from the global financial crisis. As of August 2010, it had committed around $200bn in lending to a number of economies affected by the crisis. The biggest borrowers then were Hungary, Romania and Ukraine. The recent eurozone crisis also triggered extensive IMF intervention, including hefty bailouts for countries such as Greece, Portugal and Ireland in tandem with the European Union. It is currently contributing to the second international bailout of Greece, and discussing further loans to Hungary. The IMF can also grant emergency loans following natural disasters; these have included the 2004 Asian tsunami. Developing countries have voiced dissatisfaction with what they say is their lack of influence in the IMF and World Bank. This includes the so-called Bric countries - Brazil, Russia, India and China - whose economic power has grown significantly. They have called for changes to the quota system in which votes in the IMF are weighted in line with member nations' financial contributions. Under this system, the US has 17% of the vote in the IMF, whereas India, with more than three times the population of the US, has less than one third. And because constitutional changes in the IMF require 85% of the vote, the US has a veto. The long-standing arrangement under which the IMF is usually led by a European, while the World Bank is led by an American, has also been called into question. Ms Lagarde quickly appointed Zhu Min - a former deputy governor of the People's Bank of China - to the newly created post of deputy managing director when she took over.",

        "article": "Tottenham moved back to within two points of Premier League leaders Leicester after battling back from behind to beat a dogged Swansea side. Alberto Paloschi gave the visitors the lead after Angel Rangel's shot fell to him via team-mate Jack Cork. Swansea goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski made a series of superb saves, before Nacer Chadli deflected in Kyle Walker's shot to equalise with 20 minutes left. Danny Rose then drove in the winner after Swansea failed to clear a corner. Hopes have been growing at White Hart Lane of a first league title since 1961, but the pressure was on to beat struggling Swansea after Leicester opened up a five-point lead with a victory over Norwich on Saturday. Mauricio Pochettino's side were utterly dominant - managing 34 shots at goal to Swansea's 10 - but were frustrated by determined defending and brilliant goalkeeping. Spurs could have forgiven for thinking it was not going to be their day, particularly when the outstanding Fabianski dived acrobatically to his right to claw out Christian Eriksen's free-kick early in the second half. Fabianski had earlier made an excellent stop to deny Harry Kane from close range, but was finally beaten as substitute Chadli struck and Rose added his first goal of the season. For Pochettino, it was a sign that his players have the character to force victories when fortune appears to be against them. Pochettino's side secured a sixth successive league victory to keep the pressure on Leicester - on a day when neighbours Arsenal lost ground with a defeat at Manchester United. The concern for Tottenham's manager is that his key players steer clear of injury as the attempt to juggle domestic demands with the Europa League. England forward Kane was patched up to play in a face mask after missing Thursday's victory over Fiorentina with a broken nose. There was concern too before kick-off as midfielder Dele Alli, an inspirational figure for them this season, turned his ankle in the warm-up. Alli was able to play the full game, but did not look at his best. Pochettino must hope that the midfielder is in better shape for Wednesday's trip to West Ham. Francesco Guidolin will have been cheered with the spirit his side showed - which was just the pick-me-up that the Swansea manager needed as he battles a chest infection. His side showed attacking guile on their occasional breaks forward, while Paloschi took his goal smartly to score for the first time since his move from Chievo in January. That came after Tottenham keeper Hugo Lloris made a superb early save to tip over Gylfi Sigurdsson's shot from six yards, and the France international was alert too late in the game to beat out another Paloschi shot. Guidolin, though will feel a sense of frustration that his team were unable to get anything from the game after leading with 20 minutes left. It means that, after four league games without victory, Swansea remain only three points above the relegation zone. Matches against Norwich, Bournemouth and Aston Villa in March will go a long way towards deciding their fate. Tottenham head coach Mauricio Pochettino: \"Fabianski was great. He was man of the match. Sometimes football is difficult. You play well but find it hard to score. The good thing is that the team fight. It is a fantastic win. \"Our mentality is to look to the next game and go step by step. Now we need to focus again. We have a strong squad and we will try to manage it in the right way.\" Media playback is not supported on this device Swansea first-team coach Alan Curtis: \"Fabianski made some fantastic saves. We thought maybe it would one of those days when we would ride our luck.

        "article": "The family of Charlotte Bevan, whose body was found in the Avon Gorge with her four-day old daughter, has called for a dedicated service which looks after women with serious mental health problems before, during and after childbirth. Having a baby is a joyous occasion for most women - but for one in 10, pregnancy and the period following childbirth can be anything but rosy. Depression, anxiety and stress can be the overriding feelings they experience and, if left untreated, the risk increases that they develop into serious psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, psychoses and eating disorders. The mental health of this group of women during pregnancy and after birth - whether the illness already existed beforehand or developed for the first time - has been of particular concern to mental health professionals for some time. Psychiatric disorders are the cause of 7% of all maternal deaths during pregnancy and the six months after the birth. So why are there still women falling through the net? Guidelines from NICE, the health watchdog, say women at risk of mental health problems should receive extra support at all stages of pregnancy, be provided with a care plan for their treatment and be offered advice on the safest and most appropriate drugs to take during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Research suggests providing this level of care will improve not only the long-term well-being of the mother but protect the child's emotional and physical development too. But the Maternal Mental Health Alliance (MMHA), which represents more than 70 organisations committed to improving the mental health of mothers and their infants, says this isn't happening in many areas of the country. Dr Alain Gregoire, consultant and honorary senior lecturer in perinatal psychiatry, and chair of the MMHA, says this failure is costing lives. Suicide is an increased risk for women with serious perinatal psychiatric disorders, he says. And then there's the cost to society, he points out, of \u00c2\u00a38bn a year in lost earnings and NHS care. He says: \"It's a very critical time in women's lives and it's important to get it right.\" The inquest heard that Ms Bevan stopped taking her anti-psychotic medication some time before the birth of her daughter because she wanted to breastfeed. Dr Gregoire says decisions like this should be part of a care plan agreed in advance and need not be a major issue, he adds. \"There are many medication options available with no evidence of risk to the baby, whereas there is clear evidence that women being unwell is not good for mother or baby.\" Stopping medication suddenly is never advised and can be avoided because there are always other effective treatment options, he says. Rachael Jones felt no connection with her pregnancy and no happiness at the thought of son's arrival five years ago. She had always wanted children but she didn't tell anyone how she was feeling because she didn't understand the feelings herself. \"No-one asked me how I was feeling. There wasn't an opportunity to talk about it, no invitation to chat about it from anyone I saw.\" It was only after the birth that Rachael admitted to a health visitor that she felt detached, lonely and depressed. She had experienced suicidal thoughts too. During a 12-month wait for talking therapy on the NHS, she relied on family and friends to help her get through each day with postnatal depression. And, in the meantime, she set up a charity dedicated to pre and postnatal depression advice and support, called the PANDAS Foundation. She says the Charlotte Bevan inquest demonstrates how important it is for pregnant women to be able to talk about their mental health. Rachael wants communication between health professionals to improve so that women like her are properly supported during pregnancy. She also believes doctors and midwives need a better understanding of mental health so that they can ask the right questions and offer support at the right times. If or when a pregnant woman's mental health deteriorates, the guidelines state that all women with a child under a year old should be offered a place in one of the 17 specialist psychiatric care mother and baby units in the UK. But a map of these dedicated mother and baby units, with an average of eight beds per unit, show that some areas such as the south, south-west and east of England, and Wales, are noticeably underserved. Another map of specialist community perinatal mental health teams across the UK shows there is a very patchy service, with most areas having an extremely basic level of provision, or none at all. However, Alistair Burt, Minister of State for Community and Social Care, said perinatal mental health was a strong priority for the government and it was investing \u00c2\u00a375m over the next five years \"to help drive improvements\". \"Since 2010 the number of in-patient mother and baby units which specialise in caring for women during the perinatal period has almost doubled and we have trained more than 600 perinatal mental health visitor champions.\" The Royal College of Midwives has said that more midwives with specialist training in mental health are needed to work with at-risk women. But this relies on GPs, midwives and health visitors recognising that their patients are suffering in the first place. NHS England estimates that around 3% of women who give birth each year will be referred to psychiatric services and 1% will need specialised care in a mother and baby unit. That's 6,700 women with serious mental illnesses who need specialist help. They are at one end of a wide spectrum of mental illnesses which can affect pregnant women - ranging from mild to severe. Rachael did not take any medication for her condition. All she wanted was to speak to someone else who felt the way she did, so she could feel normal. Instead, she suffered in silence.",

McGuigan and father Barry, the former world champion, signed Taylor to their Cyclone Promotions company when he won 2014 Commonwealth gold and turned pro. \"I thought you saw the complete article,\" said Shane McGuigan of the man from Prestonpans in East Lothian. \"He looked like he could punch - now he can really punch since changing the technique a bit.\" In addition, the trainer said he was keen to work with Taylor because \"he has a great personality, he's a good-looking lad, he's fast and he can really fight - he ticked a lot of boxes\". He added: \"Also, I felt dad, with his background, a hall of famer, being a Celt himself, can appeal to a lot of the public in Scotland.\" Taylor left Edinburgh's Lochend club, where he worked under Terry McCormack, and now trains for his pro fights at the McGuigans' gym in Wandsworth, south London. He is aiming for a 10th consecutive win when he defends his Commonwealth super-lightweight title against Hackney's WBC Silver champion Ohara Davies at Glasgow's Braehead Arena on 8 July. \"Josh is a phenomenal talent, a phenomenal force,\" added McGuigan junior. \"He's been pro for a short time and he's already the Commonwealth champion and within six to 10 months he will be knocking on the door of a world title. \"We've been working together for nearly two years now and he has excelled so quickly. \"He has come out of the elite level amateur system and he is still progressing. \"He has shown me so much in the gym and now it is our chance to really showcase that talent on the main stage in front of big audiences on television and at Braehead.\" Cyclone Promotions hopes Taylor will generate the same level of appeal as his stablemate, Belfast's Carl Frampton, a two-weight world champion. \"With Carl, we built him up at home and then we took him to America and then to Manchester for a unification fight,\" said Shane McGuigan. \"That's the same sort of platform we would like to set up for Josh Taylor. \"We'd like to make him a star back home in Scotland and then filter him out to London, Manchester and the bigger arenas and then eventually go to the States. That is where he is inevitably going to end up, that's where the money is. \"It is very rare that you have the Errol Spencers coming to fight for world titles over here. If you build loyalty with your fans they will go anywhere.\" The McGuigans have already had Taylor on the road, with three of his nine fights being in El Paso, New York and Las Vegas. \"The American public loved his crowd-pleasing style, just like they loved Ricky Hatton,\" said the trainer. \"People want to see a good fighter go to work and they will get that with Josh Taylor.\" Shane McGuigan is anticipating a \"tricky\" fight against undefeated Davies next month, expecting it to go to the later rounds. However, he believes the home fighter will prevail and take over the mantle of Ricky Burns, for so long Scotland's main boxing attraction but who, in April, lost his WBA belt in Taylor's weight class to Namibia's IBF champion Julius Indongo. \"Ricky Burns has been a fantastic ambassador for Scottish boxing and a great champion but I don't see him reclaiming any world title; he's a step below that now. \"Josh Taylor is the man.

In an election pledge, Labour said giving working parents 30 hours free childcare a week for 48 weeks of the year would cost an extra \u00a384m annually. Economist Gillian Paull told BBC Wales the \"upper limit\" could reach \u00a3200m if \"nearly all\" parents took up the offer. The Welsh Government said it was currently analysing the likely costs. The promise to provide 30 hours free childcare a week was one of Labour's key election pledges and is now part of its five-year programme for government. The childcare will be made available to working parents of three- and four-year-olds for 48 weeks of the year. In a report for the Welsh Government in February, Ms Paull, of Frontier Economics, produced various cost estimates for the policy. It said the cost would be \u00a384m a year if the childcare was offered to working parents and if 87% of them took up the offer at a cost of \u00a35 per hour. However, Ms Paull warned that she thought the policy was unlikely to encourage many non-working parents to take up jobs. The Welsh Government insists the policy will remove one of the \"major barriers to employment\". Ms Paull said if the policy proved to be successful in enabling large numbers of parents take up jobs, its annual cost would increase considerably. \"The cost estimate [in the report] is based on a very small response in working behaviour,\" she told the Sunday Politics Wales programme. \"If there is a bigger response, the cost could be considerably higher. \"A reasonable upper limit would be around \u00a3200m, based on an extreme response of nearly all parents becoming eligible by working.\" David Dallimore, a social policy researcher at Bangor University, warned that money would also have to be spent expanding the availability of childcare in Wales, which he claimed was already \"patchy\". \"It's very dependent on where you live,\" he said. \"Wales has a measurably lower rate of childcare than other nations in the UK. \"In Wales it's about 30 childcare places for every 100 children - it's about 40 in England and it's nearly 50 in Scotland.\" He added: \"I think there's a lot of concern within the sector that there isn't enough provision to be able to deliver this [policy] in the current form we have.\" Indicating the end of the Communities First anti-poverty programme on Tuesday, Communities Secretary Carl Sargeant cited the childcare policy as a way of helping parents find work. \"Across government we are ensuring prosperity for all,\" he said. \"The creation of a generous childcare offer for working parents will help to remove one of the major barriers to employment.\" A Welsh Government spokeswoman said:  \"We know there are issues with capacity and cost in some parts of Wales and we are working with the childcare sector to address this. \"We are also currently undertaking complex modelling of costs. \"We have a cost range, and the purpose of our modelling and analysis is to look at key factors such as the number of eligible children, take-up rates, number of hours utilised and hourly cost, all of which impact on the overall cost estimates.\" Sunday Politics Wales is on BBC One Wales on Sunday 16 October at 1100 BST",

Media playback is not supported on this device The Hammers are leaving their home of 112 years at the end of this season for the Olympic Stadium in Stratford. It has been a much-publicised move - including revelations that the Premier League club will only pay \u00a32.5m a year in rent for their new home - but seemingly a popular one, with in excess of 50,000 season tickets already sold. But the Upton Park area is also home to thriving businesses, whose well-being is in large part due to the activity a matchday brings. The 35,000-seater stadium will be replaced by flats, but food outlets, pubs and street traders face an uncertain future when the Hammers move from E13 to E20. Supporters have a number of pre-match eating rituals, be it the temptation of sizzling onions at a burger stand, a trip to the chippy or, in East London, the traditional option of pie and mash. Full English breakfast and sausage sandwiches are the best-sellers at Ken's Cafe on Green Street, which has been family-run for 50 years. \"My dad started it off and we are all carrying it on. I was born here,\" the eponymous Ken told BBC Radio London. \"Dad's still out the back cooking and mum is serving. West Ham is in the blood and it's been good to us. \"It will be a bit quieter but we'll survive. We'll carry on because we've got all our regulars that come in during the week.\" Up the road, Osman Mustafa of Queen's Fish Bar is less optimistic about his prospects. \"At least 25% of our business comes from West Ham,\" he said. \"I hope I can keep going. With knocking the stadium down and the construction to develop the new flats, the workers there will help for a while. After a few years, I don't know. It will affect us terribly.\" When the Hammers are at home, healthy queues also form outside Nathan's Pies and Eels shop on the Barking Road, but Richard Nathan is also unsure if his family-run business, first opened in 1938, will survive. \"It managed to survive through the second World War and various family members managed to keep it going. There is a lot of history,\" he said. \"It has kept going through thick and thin but things change.\" Pubs close to football grounds are always busy on matchdays and that is true of those near the Boleyn Ground. Ron Bolwell owns The Queens and The Denmark Arms and estimates he will lose almost half a million pounds in income, which makes up two thirds of his turnover. He intends to reassess his financial situation after three months. \"On a matchday, you just can't move with the football fans and the atmosphere,\" he said. \"Our rates are very high and our rents are high. \"The brewery have mentioned they will come along and see if we can redevelop the pubs and see if we can do something different to get more people in.\" Independent programme seller Paul Vickery shifts approximately 2,000 official programmes per game from his pitch directly opposite Upton Park tube station. \"My life has been all West Ham,\" the 51-year-old said. \"I grew up selling eels and singing 'cockles and mussels'. Burgers, hot-dogs - you name it I've sold it.\" Vickery is considering whether to follow the club to the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park - but believes Upton Park will suffer in the long-term. \"I spoke to [West Ham co-owner] David Gold and asked 'what happens about us?' and he said 'you never know what is going to happen'. \"What I do know is they sold their ground and made plenty of money and then all of a sudden they rent another one. Who is in the money - him or me? \"Upton Park is going to be dead. It is going to be a has-been.\" However, Sir Robin Wales, the Mayor of Newham, believes West Ham's move will not necessarily damage the economy in Upton Park. \"If you ever go to a match, very little is spent by fans in the market and elsewhere,\" the 61-year-old said. \"They have just come for the game. \"There will be some cafes and things which will struggle and a few pubs. But fans will be drinking in Stratford so there will be jobs and opportunities there. \"I am comfortable we don't have a major problem, except for a few businesses which are specifically set up to cater for the fans coming in.\" Sir Robin says Newham Council have held talks with some businesses in Upton Park. \"We had some initial conversations with one or two and we think it would be good to be supportive,\" he added. \"We are waiting to see what happens. Otherwise, the money will go into Stratford. Because of Westfield Shopping Centre it is quite likely there will be more money going into Stratford.\" Media playback is not supported on this device Football fans will be replaced by families, creating a completely different atmosphere in that part of the East End. The place where Bobby Moore, Frank Lampard and Dimitri Payet plied their trade for West Ham will instead become 842 new flats, which will be completed by 2022. An initial 25% of the scheme is affordable housing, with Newham Council investing \u00a318m to increase that number by a further 10%, and the council insists construction jobs will be earmarked for local people. \"We'll have 800-odd families living here which will help to regenerate the whole area,\" councillor Ken Clark said. \"This is a very vibrant, diverse neighbourhood. I think the future for the area is very positive.\" Sir Robin added: \"Housing is a major problem and the problem is the government are not investing in it. \"We have got a brand new community centre being built and overall it is a big plus for the residents of Newham.\" Pub landlord Bolwell is sceptical as to whether the housing development will help his businesses. \"It will bring a bit of life into that area once it's all done but I don't think it'll make any difference to my pubs,\" he said. \"You may get one or two in but we won't get anything near what we have been getting from the football. \"There is not much more Sir Robin Wales can do really - unless he can stand outside and get customers to come in as they pass.\" Despite West Ham auctioning off memorabilia from the Boleyn Ground, the new housing development will celebrate the history of the area. A new statue of West Ham and England legend Bobby Moore, the club's current Memorial Garden and a landscaped courtyard to replace the Boleyn's centre circle will all be included in the scheme. \"Our regeneration and planning people have worked really hard to make sure we are going to get something here where people will be proud of their history and community,\" Sir Robin said. \"You want to create a community.

        "article": "As the nation anxiously waited for the EU referendum results last month, currency traders were busy making bets on which way the vote would go. The pound started to rise just before the first results came in as traders predicted a win for the Remain side - eventually hitting a high of over $1.50. But as reality sank in and the Leave side pulled away the currency went into freefall touching lows of $1.30, levels not seen since 1985. Since then the pound has had some better days but has still lost over 13% of its value against the dollar. The value of a nation's currency is often described as its effective share price - a gauge of how investors see the strength of the economy. \"The fall in the pound can be seen as a barometer of sentiment in the markets,\" says Jeremy Stretch, a currency analyst at CIBC. \"If a currency falls traders are effectively saying that it needs to go lower to make it attractive enough for them to make investments.\" Despite having fallen to lows we have not seen for 30 years, some in the market think the pound could still fall further against the dollar. \"When you look at how quickly the pound has fallen in the past, I don't think it is beyond the bounds of possibility that we could see the pound in the low $1.20 range against the dollar,\" says Simon Derrick, head of currency research at Bank of New York Mellon. So what does history tell us about one of the key drivers of the UK economy? November 2007: sterling reached $2.11 The pound soared from $1.40 in 2002 right up to $2.10 in October 2007. British tourists flocked to the US as the pound strengthened, often coming backed weighed down with suitcases full of clothes and gadgets. \"It was in some respects the golden days for the UK with a booming financial sector and the sense of 'Cool Britannia' in the country,\" says Prof Albrecht Ritschl an economic historian at the London School of Economics. The pound strengthened as the UK economy boomed, inflation stayed relatively low and interest rates offered a decent return for investors. \"It was a very settled economic environment with few political upheavals, completely different from the post-Brexit world we see today,\" says Howard Archer, an economist at IHS Global Insight. Those heady days of economic boom were replaced with the financial crisis of 2008 which saw the pound collapse as the UK economy fell into recession. The pound fell 35% to lows of about $1.40 in early 2009, before picking up as the UK slowly emerged from the downturn. February 1985: Sterling reached $1.05 Back in February 1985, the pound slid to $1.05. But unlike today it was less a story of pound weakness and more to do with a very strong dollar. The combination of Ronald Reagan as US president and the tenure of Paul Volcker as chairman of the Federal Reserve saw the dollar appreciate 26% between 1980 and 1984. President Reagan instituted a series of tax cuts and spending rises in an attempt to revive the economy. This in turn pushed up long-term interest rates, attracting inflows of capital and pushing up the value of the dollar. Despite the pressure of the strong dollar, the UK economy was performing well at the time with economic growth of 2.3% in 1984 and 4.2% in 1985. The strength of the dollar created international tension which was addressed in an unprecedented meeting of world leaders and central bankers at the Plaza Hotel in New York in September 1985. The central bankers agreed that other currencies should appreciate against the dollar and followed their words with interventions in foreign exchange markets, selling dollars in exchange for other currencies. The actions of those involved in the so-called \"Plaza Accord\" contributed to the dollar falling 40% between 1985 and 1987. The pound gained ground on the dollar in the months that followed, hitting $1.88 in December 1987.",

        "article": "New research has highlighted security issues on four separate smart gadgets. A smart doorbell, a connected camera, a child's toy and a locator to help monitor children were all found to be vulnerable to straightforward attacks. The default passwords and bad security practices could have leaked data to attackers, said the research teams. However, all four firms have acted on the warnings, tightened up code and closed loopholes. \"The problem with the Internet of Things these days is that everyone is becoming an IT shop whether they like it or not and whether they realise it or not,\" said Tod Beardsley, security research manager at Rapid7, who uncovered problems with two of the devices. While IoT device makers were writing code more confidently, few took the extra design steps to make sure the programming they put into smart devices was secure, the researchers found. Mr Beardsley checked the security in two devices from separate firms: The way the bear communicated with the web was poorly configured, he found, so attackers could have interrogated it to find out more about its young owner, their family and home network. Similar problems were found with the HereO watch that could have let an attacker add themselves to a group of watches used by a family or other group. HereO's chief technology officer said his team fixed the flaw within four hours of being alerted to it. \"We not only appreciate Rapid7's feedback, but also welcome and embrace the valuable support of the global IoT [internet of things] community in our relentless efforts to maintain a bar-none, zero-tolerance environment for the safety and security of our users,\" said Eli Shemesh. \"As HereO at the time had yet to commercialise its GPS watches, at no point was any child at risk of any malicious activity.\" Separately, researchers at Context IS uncovered security issues with a Motorola Focus outdoor camera. If exploited, the lapses could allow a camera to be taken over and remotely controlled by an attacker and used as an entrance to infiltrate a network to which it was connected. Security experts at Pentest Partners also found problems with Ring - a smart doorbell fitted with a video camera that uses an app to beam video of callers to a phone. But by removing the cover of the gadget and pressing its set-up key it becomes possible to recover the key to the wi-fi network to which it is joined, found the security testing firm. All the security failings found by the researchers were reported to the respective firms and all have now been patched or fixed. Ken Munro from Pentest Partners said Era Home Security was \"quick to respond\" to the report of the bug. Tod Beardsley from Rapid7 said getting the security bugs fixed in the two devices he studied was a \"good and surprising outcome\". \"I was expecting the usual emotional response of, 'How dare you hack our stuff?' and 'What's your motivation?'\" he told the BBC. \"But both firms were very mature about it.\" He added that there were no reports of IoT devices being targeted by attackers as yet but security firms were keen to get product designers thinking about ways to secure their creations as soon as possible. Industry initiatives such as BuildItSecure.ly have been created that attempt to educate gadget makers about secure coding. \"We are seeing the deployment of internet of things devices accelerate,\" he said, \"but we can still get ahead of the curve and prevent some future disasters.\"",

Two Jesse Sene-Lefao tries got the Tigers on the way after Leigh had one of three scores ruled out by the video referee, before Eden cut loose. All four of his tries were created by the potent left-side combination of Luke Gale and Michael Shenton. Jake Webster added a seventh Tigers try, their 101st league score of 2017. Since these two teams met on the opening weekend of the season, Daryl Powell's Castleford have proved to be the stand-out team in the division, and showed hallmarks of that quality to dispatch the Centurions - who have struggled since a bright start. Leigh were not disgraced by their performance and had plenty of ball but defence has been a major improvement for the Tigers, who have the best record in the division. Discipline did not help them, as Cas loanee Ben Crooks went to the sin-bin for a dangerous tackle call and the Tigers scored in his absence. However, it is Castleford's attacking menace which has caught the eye most and they were at their best, through the influential England half-back Gale in particular. Sene-Lefao took his personal tally to six for the season but Eden is now just 14 tries behind last season's Super League record-breaking winger Denny Solomona with 14 games of the season left to play. Castleford coach Daryl Powell: \"I thought we were superb in the second 20 minutes of the first half. We defended well all the way through but made too many errors when we got in attacking positions early on. \"To nil a team is very difficult to do and we showed some last-ditch stuff there which shows the character in the team. We have done that twice now this season and they are big results for us. \"I thought our attitude was outstanding, given we've just had the second ridiculous short turnaround this season. It's crazy how that has been put together. \"The boys have put a lot of emphasis on defence this year and they were delighted to keep a clean sheet.\" Leigh: McNally; Dawson, Crooks, Fleming, Brown; Reynolds, Drinkwater; Acton, Hood, Burr, Paterson, Vea, Stewart.

        "article": "With slightly hunched shoulders and an unassuming manner, 59-year-old Tsai Ing-wen doesn't look like a threat to Beijing. But she has just won Taiwan's presidency and is steely in her belief that Taiwan's future should be determined by its people. This is a direct challenge to China, which still sees the island as a province to be reunified by force if needed. What Beijing will have to decipher is where exactly Ms Tsai stands on the issue of Taiwan's sovereignty and what her next move will be. She has skilfully avoided clarifying this. She is not just a mystery to China. Many Taiwanese see her as a quiet enigmatic force, difficult to predict. She has described herself as someone who likes to walk next to walls to avoid the spotlight and characterised her rapid ascendency in politics as an \"accidental life\". Why does this election matter? Is it all about the economy? What's behind the China-Taiwan divide? Ms Tsai is Taiwan's first female leader but unlike other Asian women who rose to the top, she didn't come from a political family. The youngest of 11 children born to the last of her father's four wives, she grew up in a well-to-do family. Her father ran a successful car repair business and made money investing in land, but insisted she attend public schools to expose her to wider society. She spent the first 30 years of her life deep in academic pursuits: getting a bachelor of law at National Taiwan University, a master's in law at Cornell University in the US and a PhD at the London School of Economics, eventually becoming a law professor. Her area of expertise and English proficiency meant she was called upon in the 1990s to become a legal consultant for Taiwan's World Trade Organization (WTO) entry negotiations. So began her entry into public life. As national security advisor to former President Lee Teng-hui, she helped draft his special state-to-state relations doctrine, in which he defined relations between Beijing and Taipei as that of two countries - a move that angered China. But under the next president Chen Shui-bian and at one of the worst times for cross-strait relations, Ms Tsai, as head of the Mainland Affairs Council, found a way to work with a hostile China and launched the landmark \"Small Mini Links\" programme in 2001, which allowed direct ferry transport and trade links between Taiwan's outlying islands and mainland China. She later pushed for the first-ever chartered flights between the two sides. And in 2003, despite concerns about Taiwan opening up too much too soon to China, Ms Tsai convinced Mr Chen and legislators to revise Taiwan's law governing relations with China, making it legal for Taiwanese businesses to invest in the mainland. \"From her perspective, since this was something people needed and were already doing illegally, she thought the government should develop a law and let people do it legally,\" said Ho Mei-yueh, a former economics minister who worked closely with Ms Tsai. Those who know her say she is practical and flexible with a knack for building consensus. \"She's not someone who will take the initiative to go on stage, but once she sits down at the meeting table, she's the leader, said Mr Ho. But even those who know her are unclear about her stance on Taiwan's independence. \"She's not anti-China, not deep-green (the colour of the pro-independence DPP), and she's never said she favours Taiwan's independence,\" said Chang Jing-wen, who has written a book about Ms Tsai's career. But Ms Tsai makes clear that she holds Taiwan's democracy dear; she agreed to take over the DPP in the throes of crisis in 2008, because she believed that a strong opposition was crucial for democracy. In a clue to what turned her from a reluctant politician to embracing her destiny, she described in her recently published book how she felt when an elderly restaurant worker donated her entire month's salary of NT$20,000 (US$600) to her campaign:  \"I will always remember. She said she doesn't ask for anything in return, and only hopes that the DPP will help her protect Taiwan's sovereignty; she wants to keep being a Taiwanese person.\" Few expect her to push for independence. Yet, despite intense pressure from China and the establishment KMT party, Ms Tsai has not accepted what Beijing insists is the only basis for future relations - a consensus reached with Taiwan in 1992 that there is only one China, with each side free to interpret what that means. Beijing takes that to mean Taiwan and the mainland are one China. Yet she has also moved away from her party's and her previous position that no such consensus exists. She will know better than many that China remains paramount: Taiwan badly needs economic agreements from its biggest trade partner, particularly when export markets remain uncertain. Kou Chien-wen, a political science professor at National Chengchi University, speaks of her flexibility: \"I don't think she's someone who is strongly ideological. She is very clever.\" In a sign of this, when Chinese netizens posted tens of thousands of messages on her Facebook page criticising her during her campaign, Ms Tsai simply posted: \"I hope this rare opportunity can help our 'new friends' get a complete view of the democracy, freedom, and diversity of Taiwan. Welcome to the world of Facebook!\" Ironically, Ms Tsai could turn out to be a better partner for Beijing than current President Ma Ying-jeou, who is not trusted by some because his parents came from mainland China and his party is pro-unification. Agreements signed with Ms Tsai will not likely face opposition. Being a mixture of Taiwan's different ethnic groups, and the descendant of a long-time Taiwanese family, has helped her win the trust of voters. Her father was Hakka, her mother Minnan, and her paternal grandmother was from the Paiwan indigenous tribe. But if she is unable to win China's trust, her term could be marked by stalemate, or Beijing could shrink or sever official ties. Tensions could resurface, worrying regional neighbours and affecting ties between Beijing and Washington, which is bound by law to help Taiwan defend itself. Her book offers a clue to her philosophy. Quoting German sociologist Max Weber, she compared politics to the strong and slow boring of hard boards: \"We have to be more patient [and work] steadily, practically, and accurately to achieve the ideal. This is my style.\"",

        "article": "Leeds United dropped out of the Championship play-off places as Wolves clinched a narrow win at Elland Road. Wolves started brightly and Nouha Dicko gave them the lead, beating Rob Green with a low first-time shot on the run. Leeds turned up the pressure after the break, but Andy Lonergan saved from Souleymane Doukara and Kortney Hause cleared off the line to keep it 1-0. Fulham's 3-1 win over Aston Villa and Sheffield Wednesday's 2-1 victory at QPR sees Leeds drop into seventh place. Despite losing their past two Championship matches, Wolves dominated the opening exchanges, with Green having to come out quickly and make a low save one-on-one from Andreas Weimann. Dave Edwards forced another Green stop and Dicko went close, cutting inside and firing narrowly wide before the goal their pressure deserved finally came. The 24-year-old striker latched onto Ben Marshall's clever through-ball behind the defence and found the bottom corner before Green could set himself. Leeds rallied, but Pontus Jansson could not hit the target with a free header and Lonergan produced a reflex save to keep out Doukara's header from Kemar Roofe's cutback. Wolves sat back and invited pressure, with Hause clearing Roofe's looping header off the line from a corner and Chris Wood heading over late on, but the away side hung on to claim the points. The win secures Wolves' Championship status for another season on 54 points, while Leeds' third loss in five games puts them out of the play-offs on goal difference with three matches remaining. Leeds manager Garry Monk: \"We're disappointed with that result. \"We didn't want that to happen at this stage of the season but we've had the mentality for so long where we've been in the play-offs quite comfortably and have kind of been in that protective mode of trying to stay in there. \"Now we have to change that mentality to be a team that goes on the hunt and lets it all go. \"It's still a really good situation for us. We've got no time to feel sorry for ourselves, that doesn't get you anywhere.\" Wolves manager Paul Lambert: \"We were excellent and should have been two or three up in the first half. \"We were strong defensively in the second half and a threat on the break.\" Match ends, Leeds United 0, Wolverhampton Wanderers 1.

The 69-year-old also managed the Blues on a temporary basis for the final three months of the 2008-09 campaign. \"I am excited to return,\" said the Dutchman. \"Chelsea is one of the biggest clubs in the world but is not where it should be at the moment. \"However, I am sure we can all turn this season around.\" Mourinho was sacked on Thursday with champions Chelsea 16th in the Premier League table, one point above the relegation zone. Hiddink watched Saturday's visit of Sunderland from the stands, sat next to Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich and former Blues striker Didier Drogba. Coaches Steve Holland and Eddie Newton were in charge of the team for the game against the Black Cats. \"It's a fantastic appointment. I'm very happy about it.

He has also coached South Korea, Australia and Russia. He took over at Stamford Bridge in February 2009, replacing Luiz Felipe Scolari, and shared the role with his job as Russia manager. Since then, he has endured unsuccessful spells as manager of Turkey, Russian side Anzhi Makhachkala and the Netherlands.

The Briton produced a stunning lap to be 0.360 seconds quicker than Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg - and seemed as if he may have been able to go faster. But the track was empty for the final five minutes and senior figures said the format should be rethought. Red Bull team boss Christian Horner said F1 should \"apologise to the fans\". \"It didn't really work for me,\" Horner added. \"We have not really put on a show. \"To have Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Raikkonen in fast cars not taking part with five minutes to go is wrong.\" Rosberg was behind both Ferraris after the first runs in the final session, but he grabbed second on his final run ahead of Vettel and Raikkonen, who will start third and fourth respectively. The first race of the new season gets under way on Sunday at 05:00 GMT, with coverage on radio 5 live from 04:00 and online from 03:30. Rosberg said straight after the session: \"It's good to try something but it hasn't worked - so we should go back.\" Ferrari's Vettel, who qualified third but was able to change out of his overalls in time for the post-qualifying news conference because he did not run in the second part of the final session, said: \"I don't see why everyone is surprised it didn't work. \"It is a bit busier at the beginning of the session but for no reason. People want to see us pushing to the limit at the end of the session. It is the wrong way to go and that's what we said.\" The new format did work on one level, however. It made the first and second parts of the session more fraught - and one top team was caught out as Red Bull's Daniil Kvyat ended up 18th on the grid. Media playback is not supported on this device Hamilton was 0.838secs quicker than Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel, who was also 0.478secs behind Rosberg. The margin between the cars was such that Ferrari decided not to bother doing a second run in the final session of qualifying because they accepted they could not beat the Mercedes and preferred to save a set of tyres for the race. On the face of it, that suggests Mercedes are as far ahead of Ferrari as they were last year. But Hamilton was actually even further ahead of Vettel in qualifying in Australia last year and the German won the next race in Malaysia. Hamilton said: \"I really have to take my hat off to this team - what they have done to raise the bar once more. It inspires and motivates me. \"I enjoyed driving the car in qualifying, got the set-up just right. They were some sexy laps, beautiful rhythm, it felt so good. I felt like James Brown at the end of the lap.\" Vettel added: \"We expected them to be stronger in qualifying, which they were. Very happy with the lap in the end so we saved a set for the race. We still have high hopes for tomorrow and it is a long year.\" Toro Rosso's Max Verstappen and Carlos Sainz were fifth and seventh, split by Williams driver Felipe Massa. Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo and the Force Indias of Sergio Perez and Nico Hulkenberg completed the top 10. McLaren's Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button took 12th and 13th, a huge improvement on their dismal 2015, and Briton Jolyon Palmer 14th for Renault on his grand prix debut, ahead of team-mate and former McLaren driver Kevin Magnussen.

        "article": "A US policeman who climbed on to a car bonnet and fired repeatedly through the windscreen at unarmed black occupants has been cleared of all charges. Timothy Russell and Malissa Williams died in 2012 in a barrage of bullets fired by 13 officers in a car chase. Michael Brelo, 31, the only officer to be charged, was cleared of voluntary manslaughter at the court in Cleveland. The US has seen a series of police race-related killings, some of which have led to serious civil unrest. In Cleveland itself, the police shooting last November of a 12-year-old black boy, Tamir Rice, as he waved a replica firearm, fuelled the national debate over police use of deadly force. The ruling has caused anger in the community but protests held after the verdict have been peaceful. Protesters gathered outside the cordoned-off courthouse, some chanting, \"Hands up, don't shoot!\" They later marched from the courthouse to the recreation centre where Tamir Rice was shot. Some 200 people also held a mock funeral procession in the city, carrying a black coffin and singing to mark six months since the shooting of Tamir Rice. Some held signs that said: \"Will I be next?\" Analysis: BBC North America correspondent Rajini Vaidyanathan The dramatic car chase that ultimately led to the deaths of Timothy Russell and Malissa Williams happened more than two years ago, but many are hearing their story for the first time. Police shootings aren't uncommon, but events in Ferguson and more recently Baltimore have propelled these issues to the top of the agenda, forcing America to take a long hard look at the way it handles these cases. In this instance, the judge decided to acquit Michael Brelo - a conviction required a burden of proof he believed wasn't there. But recent protests on the streets of Cleveland show that campaigners are keeping up momentum in raising the wider issues of police brutality. Earlier this week activists took to the streets to highlight the number of black women victims of police violence. The #SayHerName #BlackWomenMatter campaign is designed to raise awareness of black female victims, who don't always attract the same level of media attention. Police Chief Calvin Williams vowed to support peaceful protest but warned the city would not tolerate violence. The case involving the deaths of Russell, 43, and Williams, 30, had sparked a department of justice inquiry that concluded Cleveland police had engaged in a pattern of excessive force and violation of civil rights. Only Mr Brelo was charged because prosecutors said the pair in the car were no longer a threat when he climbed on to the bonnet of their car and fired 15 shots through the windscreen in 7.4 seconds. But the judge said that as other officers had fired in a 137-shot barrage, he could not rule beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Brelo was responsible for the deaths. Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Judge John O'Donnell also cleared Mr Brelo of the lesser count of felonious assault. The judge said he would not \"sacrifice\" Mr Brelo if the evidence did not warrant conviction. \"Guilty or not guilty, the verdict should be no cause for a civilised society to celebrate or riot,\" he said. County prosecutor Timothy McGinty said he was \"profoundly disappointed\" with the verdict. Russell's sister, Michele, said Mr Brelo would not \"dodge this just because he was acquitted. God will have the final say.\" Mr Brelo had faced up to 22 years in jail if convicted of voluntary manslaughter. The incident occurred when the car, a Chevy Malibu, backfired while speeding past Cleveland police HQ, and officers thought a gun had been discharged. Some 62 police cars were then involved in a 22-mile chase at speeds up to 100 mph. Both Russell and Williams had previous convictions and a crack pipe was found in the car. Mr Brelo's lawyer, Patrick D'Angelo, said his client had risked his life during the chase and that the prosecution of the case was \"vicious and unprofessional\".

        "article": "The death of Saif al-Arab Gaddafi, if confirmed, is likely to have come as a consequence of Nato's increasingly aggressive tactics, undertaken by the alliance to shake up a stalemate in the conflict. But his killing in an air strike is a grievous strategic error - militarily insignificant but diplomatically disastrous. Towards the end of April, Nato states made a number of operational innovations. Three member states - Britain, France, and Italy - injected military advisers into rebel-held eastern Libya. Another, the US, began continuous patrols of armed drones. Third, and most important, air strikes began to target command, control, communications and intelligence networks (known, in military parlance, as C3I). The Bab al-Aziziya compound includes all three such networks, and it was presumed that their disruption would disorient regime soldiers on the front line, cut off field commanders from Tripoli, and sow confusion in the ranks. But was the strike also an assassination attempt? Assassination of a head of state is illegal under international law, and forbidden by various US presidential orders. On the other hand, the targeted killing of those woven into the enemy chain of command is shrouded in legal ambiguity. Given the personalistic nature of the regime, and the \"all means necessary\" clause in UN Resolution 1973, it might be argued that killing Col Muammar Gaddafi and certain members of his family - such as his son Khamis, commander of an elite military brigade - would be permissible, even if it posed a risk to those non-combatants around the regime. Legality, though, indicates neither legitimacy nor prudence. This strike, and the death of Saif al-Arab, have produced little military result at the greatest diplomatic and symbolic cost to Nato. Saif al-Arab was, unlike his brothers, not a senior military commander or propagandist. His death is redolent of the 1986 US strike on the same compound. That raid killed a girl who Col Gaddafi later claimed was his adopted daughter and, in the scarred buildings and craters, furnished him with a long-lasting symbol of defiance. The propaganda value of such unintended deaths is potentially severe. In the 1991 Gulf War, a US stealth bomber directed two bombs at what was claimed to be a command-and-control bunker, but was in fact an Iraqi civilian shelter. The result was 315 deaths, including 130 children. Col Gaddafi, like Saddam Hussein before him, will take every opportunity to exploit such errors to paint Western powers as indiscriminate aggressors. Moreover, this is no longer a conventional war in which top-down direction is crucial. Pro-Gaddafi forces in both the besieged western city of Misrata and in the east have adapted to Nato's air power and are using increasingly unorthodox tactics. They need not rely on a stream of detailed orders from Tripoli, and can cause considerable harm to civilians without this guidance. Nato is understandably frustrated at the diminishing returns of air strikes, since it has destroyed most accessible targets. But killing commanders and disrupting communications is far less important than the key task of degrading heavy military equipment, such as tanks and artillery. If the strike had killed Col Gaddafi himself, would it then have been at least a military success? One of the greatest mistakes of the Iraq war was assuming that, with the departure of Saddam Hussein, the state apparatus could simply be transferred to new ownership. Col Gaddafi's death could see Saif al-Islam Gaddafi take the reins, galvanise supporters, and continue the war with equal intensity. It would be dangerous and short-sighted to portray even effective assassination as a silver bullet. Perhaps, though, the demonstration to the regime that no safe haven exists, and that only capitulation would bring security, justified these risks? There is no doubt that, along with the military aim of disrupting command-and-control hubs, Nato sought a psychological effect, conscious of the possibility of \"accidental assassination\". The problem is that the direction of this effect is unclear. The dramatic visual impact of this air strike, and the death of those disconnected from political and military leadership, will harden the diplomatic opposition to the war, from Russia and China amongst others. More consequentially, it will anger the alliance's warier members, like Germany and Turkey, and inflame parts of Arab and African public opinion. It may eventually leave Britain and France bearing the military burden alone, with modest but limited assistance from a cagey US administration eager to keep at arm's length from this European war. Col Gaddafi's overarching strategy has never been to win a conventional war, but to induce symbolically prominent casualties, drive a wedge between more committed and more ambivalent members of the coalition, and knock away the pillars of political support on which this intervention was built. Thus far, the coalition had sought, rightly, to purchase coalition longevity at the price of campaign intensity. If that balance continues to shift towards the latter, Nato runs the risk of playing into the regime's hands.

        "article": "If you spent $9bn a year on research and development and employed 900 of the world's top computer scientists to come up with new ideas, what would you expect in return? More than a new way of playing video games, a cynic might say. Special Report: The Technology of Business Digital death of a business card? Mobile advertisers want your phone Rinsing your reputation the online way Mobile working comes of age Using voice to give your app the edge But Microsoft - a company that may well spend more on R&D than any other business - believes its strategy is paying off, and the proof is the XBox Kinect system. On a visit to the company's headquarters, I had a chance to see some of the projects that Microsoft scientists at its laboratories in Redmond, in Beijing and in Cambridge, England, believe will change the way we see computers. And the striking thing about what Microsoft's research chief Craig Mundie picked to show off to a group of technology journalists was that almost all of them involved Kinect. The system which turns a player's body into a games controller was developed with the help of seven different research groups at the company's three main labs, some working on voice recognition, others on motion sensors and a range of other technologies. Now they are looking at what Kinect could do next. We saw a system which would allow two people to see different images on the same screen, their eyes tracked by the Kinect camera. Other scientists showed off ways that the camera could capture objects and people in 3D, which might have applications in future telepresence systems. And there was plenty of work on avatars, for use in either games or in video-conferencing. Two Chinese researchers demonstrated a photo-realistic talking head - type in some text and he'll say anything you want, blinking and moving almost like a real person. Craig Mundie says the success of Kinect, which racked up 8m sales in its first 60 days, is proof that the sheer scale of Microsoft's R&D strategy is paying off. \"Microsoft is at a point where many of the things that we've been researching for twenty years are starting to add up and produce solutions,\" he says. \"You can't rely on two guys in a garage to make all the changes, some of these things require a huge amount of technology and a lot of scale.\" But Microsoft desperately needed a hit from its research labs. Ever since Bill Gates decided 20 years ago that the company would spend big bucks on trying to see into the future, there have been ideas aplenty but few stand out products. A decade ago, for instance, Gates was showing off tablet computers - but it took Apple and its iPad to make them mainstream. Peter Lee, who runs the Redmond lab, says the research operation has a wide remit, from dealing with instant fixes to current products to blue-sky thinking. Professor Lee, who joined Microsoft last year after a distinguished academic career and a spell at the US defence agency DARPA, insists the labs are having an impact  on a daily basis. He cites the contribution to what he describes as the \"holy war in search\", the battle between Google and Microsoft's Bing. \"Hour by hour we have a large group of researchers actively involved in Bing, constantly adding new research advances into the product.\" But he thinks the long-term research is equally important. \"Some call it navel-gazing, we call it pushing back the frontiers of human knowledge,\" he says with a smile, predicting that his lab will one day win a Nobel prize. His boss Craig Mundie is Microsoft's big thinker, charting the path of its future research. His current obsession is what he calls natural user interfaces, new ways of interacting with computers, of which Kinect is one example. There is, he says, a shift about to happen from the old graphical user interface to a trend where \"the computer is more like us - it sees, it listens, it speaks, it understands, it even seeks to do things on our behalf.\" It is an intriguing vision, but here's a sobering fact. All these clever ideas, smart people, and major investment have not stopped Microsoft from being overtaken in the last year in terms of market value by Apple, which seems to focus on the customer experience now, rather than five years down the line. Big, sleepy, and dull, I suggested to Mr Mundie, is how many people now perceive Microsoft. \"We don't feel big and sleepy or dull,\" he responded, \"but if people perceive us that way I think looking at the stuff that Kinect brings should change that view.\" And he insists that firms that do not have the patience to spend on long-term research will lose out in the end. \"I don't think any company is going to prevail over a long period of time in giving good business returns, if they aren't making these kind of investments. They'll come and go in a generation if they don't have the staying power that's produced by having real mastery of the underlying technologies.\" Microsoft, which still generates huge revenues from its core products, Windows and Office, can well afford to keep spending on its blue-sky thinking. But having made such a big bet on science, it will be hoping that the coming years will produce more Kinects, and fewer tablet PCs.",

A robot arm builds \"babies\" that get progressively better at moving without any human intervention. The ultimate aim of the research project is to develop robots that adapt to their surroundings. The work by teams in Cambridge and Zurich has been published in the journal PLOS One. It seems like a plot from a science fiction film:  a robot that builds other robots  - each one better than the previous generation. But that is what researchers in Cambridge and Zurich have done. But those concerned about machines taking over the world shouldn't worry, at least not yet. At this stage the \"baby robots\" consist of plastic cubes with a motor inside. These are put together by a \"mother\" robot arm which glues them together in different configurations. Although the set up is simple the system itself is ingenious. The mother robot assesses how far its babies are able to move, and with no human intervention, improves the design so that the next one it builds can move further. The mother robot built ten generations of children. The final version moved twice the distance of the first before its power ran out. According to Dr Fumiya Iida of Cambridge University, who led the research with colleagues at ETH Zurich, one aim is to gain new insights into how living things evolve. \"One of the big questions in biology is how intelligence came about - we're using robotics to explore this mystery,\" he told BBC News. \"We think of robots as performing repetitive tasks, and they're typically designed for mass production instead of mass customisation, but we want to see robots that are capable of innovation and creativity.\" Another aim is to develop robots that can improve and adapt to new situations, according to Andre Rosendo - who also worked on the project. \"You can imagine cars being built in factories and the robot looking for defects in the car and fixing them by itself,\" he said. \"And robots used in agriculture could try out slightly different ways of harvesting crops to see if they can improve yield.\" Dr Iidya told me that he came into robotics because he was disappointed that the robots he saw in real life were not as good as the ones he saw in science fiction films such as Star Wars and Star Trek. His aim was to change that and his approach was to draw lessons from the natural world to improve the efficiency and flexibility of traditional robotic systems. As to whether we'd ever see robots like those in the sci-fi films that inspired him, he said: \"We're not there yet, but sure, why not, maybe in about 30 years.\" Follow Pallab on Twitter",

        "article": "The man hailed as the Jim Morrison of French rock returns to the music scene this week with his first record release since murdering his girlfriend in 2003. But the long-awaited comeback of Noir Desir frontman Bertrand Cantat, 49, has been overshadowed by fresh allegations over the suicide of another woman in his life. Kristina Rady, a respected Hungarian arts director and Cantat's wife, hanged herself in 2010 - two-and-a-half years after the singer's release from jail for killing the actress Marie Trintignant in Lithuania. In a telephone message to her parents left six months earlier, Rady spoke of the psychological and physical violence to which she said Cantat was subjecting her. She said that \"a series of events worse than those of 2003\" was taking place; that on several occasions she had narrowly \"escaped the very worst\"; and that \"if anything happened... there would be witnesses to testify\". The couple married in 1997 and had two children. But they separated in 2002 after Cantat started his affair with Marie Trintignant. After Cantat beat the actress to death in a Vilnius hotel room, Rady stuck by him and gave evidence in court on his behalf. When he was granted conditional release in 2007, they tried to resume their relationship. But in January 2010, Rady told her parents that she was suffering mental and physical abuse, and feared for her life. \"Everyone thinks he's an icon, and everyone wants the best for him, but then he comes home and does these terrible things to me in front of the family,\" she said. Revelations about the telephone recording have led magistrates in Bordeaux to re-open the investigation into Rady's suicide. Campaigners on behalf of victims of marital violence say there is a clear legal case to answer, and that a prosecution could be brought against Cantat for indirectly causing Rady's suicide. Further questions over Cantat's return to the spotlight have been raised as a result of a sympathetic interview in Les Inrockuptibles magazine - the first time the singer has spoken in public since the murder. In the interview Cantat complains of how the \"media circus\" twisted the events of Vilnius; how \"my own story was stolen from me\"; and how \"my view of events, my testimony was given no space\". \"My remorse, my suffering, my sensitivity - it didn't count for anything in the story. I became a caricature. The fact that I love Marie so much - it was wiped. All they wanted was what was sordid.  What was beautiful was hidden,\" he said. Asked about the Rady suicide, he said: \"My God, it's the same soap opera... the assumptions and the delusional accusations concerning me are unacceptable. It's appalling, disgraceful to have become the symbol of violence against women.\" He said he was in touch with Rady's parents, who \"recently spent a week with us. It was very warm... People tried to tell them I was a murderer, but they came to see they'd been manipulated.\" Yael Mellul, a feminist lawyer who is pushing to have Cantat questioned about Rady's death, said the interview was \"unspeakably indecent\". \"This is a man who beat a women to death with his bare hands. But in the interview he dares to talk of his love for Marie. He says it's terrible to have been turned into the symbol of violence against women. \"He positions himself as the victim - so it's our fault that his life is so painful. It's a moral inversion that is classic for this kind of perverted personality,\" she said. In Le Point news magazine, editor-in-chief Franz-Olivier Giesbert was equally scathing. \"This is not a tale of forgiveness and redemption. It's the story of a narcissistic killer, a master of self-pity. \"Most murderers, after they're released, just want to be forgotten. Not Bertrand Cantat. He needs to show his wounds to the people. He's made a career of it,\" he wrote. And Giesbert went further - accusing the \"alternative left\" establishment of being \"incredibly indulgent\" towards the singer. \"It's normal. He's a card-carrying member of the politically correct,\" he said. Noir Desir was the most influential French band of the late 1980s and 1990s, combining high-pace rock with a strong anti-capitalist message. \"The 1992 album Tostaky was a landmark album in French music. They were the only French group remotely able to capture the energy of bands like Nirvana,\" said Olivier Nuc, music critic of Le Figaro. \"Cantat was incredibly good-looking. Every girl at university was in love with him. And now he has this terrible image with women. It's the opposite of what he represented before. \"But you can see from the interview that in some ways he still does not understand why people are offended by what he did. Clearly his is a highly narcissistic personality.\" The new album - called Horizons - is, according to Nuc, a difficult and painful listen. \"Personally I have no problem with his making music. That's his job. The problem is all the promotion that goes with it. He should have released the record and shut up. \"But on its own terms the record is a success. It's dark, harrowing and depressing. Quite clearly it is translating his feelings into music - which after all is the job of art.\"",

        "article": "The number of religious holidays has come under scrutiny in South Africa, after a report suggested that minority groups were discriminated against because only Christian holidays are officially recognised. Christmas Day is the only religious holiday which is also a national public holiday, after Easter Monday was officially renamed Family Day. But South Africa's Law Reform Commission argues that is unfair and says holidays from all religions should be treated equally. The commission noted that members of other religious groups do not get paid when they skip work to observing their own holidays. Some 80% of South Africans are classed as Christian, according to the most recent available statistics, although many combine their Christian beliefs with traditional practices. The chairman of the Commission for the Promotion and Protection of Rights of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities Thoko Mkhwanazi-Xaluva said she supports a change. \"We are trying to find a middle road for the country that's not going to make people angry, that's not going to start a religious war,\" she said. \"But once you take Christianity alone and you give all the Christians all the happiness and give others nothing, then it's unconstitutional,\" she added. The commission says that the constitutional guarantee of minority rights should extend to recognition of minority faith holidays. It did not take too long before there was a push back from some Christians who were not happy with the proposal. The leader of the African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP), Reverend Kenneth Meshoe, said that if Christmas was removed from the holiday calendar - to achieve equality -  it would imply that \"South Africans don't need God in their lives, which would have serious consequences\". Mr Meshoe also said that if the matter came before parliament, the ACDP would lobby Christians from other parties to vote in favour of retaining Christian holidays. This is not the first time the matter has been raised here in South Africa. In 1994 at the end of apartheid, Ascension Day was removed as a public holiday and Easter was officially renamed Family Day, although most people still refer to it as Easter. Ten years later the issue of holidays was discussed again by the Department of Home Affairs but it was later abandoned. Religion in South Africa (most recent figures) Christianity: 79.8% Islam: 1.5% Hinduism: 1.2% Judaism: 0.2% Other beliefs: 0.6% No religion: 15% Undetermined: 1.4% Source: Census 2001 But what has been the trend elsewhere on the continent? In Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, which is roughly equally split between Christians and Muslims, both Christmas and the Prophet Muhammad's birthday Eid el-Maulud are national holidays. In Senegal, a country I have visited many times and which enjoys one of the most harmonious relations between majority and minority groups on the continent, there is much more understanding. In addition to Independence Day and Labour Day, it has numerous paid religious holidays. Sources: wego.com; officeholidays.com; 2013 Mercer study and others Some 94% of the country is Muslim and so Eid al-Fitr (the end of the fasting month of Ramadan) and Eid al-Adha (Feast of Sacrifice) are national holidays. Indeed, there are often two - when different sects celebrate the holidays on different days. But Christmas Day, Easter and Ascension are also national holidays - and are celebrated by the 5% of the population who are Christians. While this may go some way to forging religious harmony, business leaders there complain bitterly about the loss of productivity. Back in South Africa, the business community is already complaining about the number of public holidays and so would not take kindly to the idea of appeasing minority groups by having any more religious holidays. A task team was established two years ago to look into the idea of reducing the number. Although there were some recommendations that the country could do without a couple of days holiday, it was generally accepted that comparatively, Africa's most industrialised economy was not out of kilter with the rest of the world. South Africa has 13 public holidays during the course of the year, Malaysia has 12 and the United States, Singapore and France 11. Christo Botes, Executive Director of Business Partners Limited, said the problem was a month like April where they are crammed together in one month, affecting productivity levels. So for business, the idea is not necessarily to reduce the number of bank holidays but to spread them out in such a way to reduce their impact on the factories and other industries. During April's xenophobic attacks, some suggested that South Africa should have Africa Day on 25 May as a paid holiday, as is the case in many other countries on the continent. The hope was that this would bring locals closer to the idea of an African Union ideology. But no-one has raised this idea since the violence subsided. So the debate about how many public holidays South Africans should enjoy looks set to rumble on.",

Adrian Ismay, 52, was seriously hurt after a booby-trap device exploded under his van in Belfast on 4 March. The police said that a post-mortem examination showed he died as a \"direct result of the injuries\" of the bomb. A dissident republican group, widely referred to as the new IRA, said it carried out the attack. The organisation said Mr Ismay was targeted for training officers at Maghaberry Prison near Lisburn, County Antrim. Sue McAllister, director general of the Northern Ireland Prison Service, spent time with the Ismay family on Wednesday. She said they were \"devastated and beyond shock at what's happened\". \"Like all of us, they thought that he was on the mend and was doing really well,\" said Mrs McAllister. \"We thought he would make a full recovery, we expected him to come back to work in due course, so we're all shocked, but particularly Sharon and her daughters.\" Mrs McAllister condemned the behaviour of some paramilitary inmates at Maghaberry Prison, who reportedly cheered, smoked cigars and mocked wardens at the high-security jail when news of Mr Ismay's death filtered through. \"This was just unacceptable behaviour by a very small number of prisoners,\" said Mrs McAllister. \"My colleagues in Maghaberry dealt with it professionally, with great fortitude and with the courage they display on a daily basis.\" She admitted she and her colleagues in the Prison Service felt \"very angry\" on hearing the reports of the celebrations in the exercise yard of the prison. \"We encounter challenging behaviour by a small number of prisoners every day, and we deal with it with great professionalism and we do not stoop to behaving that way in response,\" she added.

        "article": "\"Mean-spirited\" and \"wrong-headed\" is how teachers' leaders have described Theresa May's plan to scrap free school meals for infant pupils in England. And perhaps to some it may seem bullish to deny the youngest kids a free lunch, even if free breakfast is on offer. The move has sparked taunts of \"May, the meals snatcher\" - reminiscent of Margaret Thatcher's infamous cancelling of free school milk. But to Theresa May's Conservatives it was a policy that no longer added up. The party does not believe \"a free school lunch for every child in the first three years of primary school... is a sensible use of public money\". It's one of those tough decisions - but a free breakfast, cheap at a 10th of the price, now seems a more desirable alternative to the Conservatives - although the value of the free-lunch scheme has never been assessed. For some, the idea - brought in by the coalition government in 2014  - was always too expensive. It was very much a Liberal Democrat policy and plans were announced by Nick Clegg at his party's conference in 2013. It was not long before his man in the education department, the then schools minister David Laws, was accused of understating the costs of the policy itself. This he denied, but the then Education Secretary Michael Gove sought reassurance from the Treasury that schools would not be forced \"to subsidise meals by reducing their spending on teaching and learning\". Those opposed also started to claim it might cut into the budget used to provide much-needed extra school places. And in a sense, the Conservatives do not want to be seen to be funding free dinners when in this tougher school-funding climate heads are saying they are unable to pay for some of the basics. They say the pressures on their budgets are much more about the unfunded extra costs of teachers' pay, pensions and national contributions. Valentine Mulholland, head of policy at the National Association of Head Teachers, said: \"After the nightmare of bringing this policy in at breakneck speed and all the capital funding spent to upgrade kitchens and dining facilities, it's pretty sad to see this U-turn.\" A BBC News Freedom of Information request just six months before it was due to come into force, in September 2014, found 2,700 primary schools needed new catering facilities before they could even think about offering free meals to all infant pupils. Primary school heads had complained they were being asked to do something undeliverable in the time allowed. In any event, as they so often do, schools managed the challenge that landed in their laps. Perhaps this is why teachers and heads appear to feel so upset at the idea of scrapping free lunches - even if breakfast is being offered instead. National Union of Teachers general secretary Kevin Courtney said cancelling the universal offer of a hot meal in the day is \"mean-spirited and wrong-headed\". The policy did not make sense, or represent value for money, given the investment many schools had already made in kitchens and staffing, he said. \"It is a long time for a child to go without food from the morning until 3:30pm, which will be the case for many families in work but struggling.\" Mr Courtney's claim may seem alarmist to some, but it will ring true for many teachers, who often raise the issue of pupil hunger. Nicky Gillhespie, school business manager at Cheam Fields Primary, said things were very different before her school introduced free school meals. \"We had children coming in with nothing. \"There were some who'd been given a pound by their parents to stop and get something in the sweet shop for lunch on the way to school,\" she said. The school in Cheam, south London, had no kitchen when the free school meals pledge was made and dinners were driven over to the school by a catering firm. \"Burgers were kept warm in trays of hot water, for example, so they looked really pale and the children just didn't want to eat them,\" she said. Since then, with the help of a government-funded kitchen pod worth \u00c2\u00a370,000, the school has seen a complete change of culture. Uptake on meals went from about 85 to 300 a day - and there were some individual success stories. \"There was one girl who would only eat rice and now she eats a full diet, like all the other children,\" Miss Gillhespie said. \"It did enable us to change the whole culture of the school - but without that being funded, I do think that it's going to be eroded away. \"Parents still think \u00c2\u00a32.30 is too much to pay for a meal and if they've got two children or even three or four, it's a lot of money. \"There must be so many children on that breadline, who wouldn't be entitled to free school meals, but will now be put off because they have to pay for it.\"",

        "article": "Three brothers from Belfast have been jailed for drugs offences linked to a significant seizure of cocaine. Gerard Kevin Hughes, 29, and Gavin Martin Hughes, 31, who are both from Springfield Park in Belfast, appeared in court alongside their older brother Joseph Christopher Hughes, 35, from The Meadows in Downpatrick. The trio all appeared at Belfast Crown Court. The charges arose from incidents in 2013. The court hearing was told that on 9 October, 2013, a car driven by Gavin Hughes was stopped in north Belfast, and when the vehicle was stopped a black plastic bag was located on the passenger seat. The bag contained five compact cubes of cocaine which amounted to 1.27 kilos of the Class A drug. When Gavin Hughes was searched, another amount of cocaine was found in the pockets of his jeans, and he was taken into custody. The following day, officers travelled to an address in the Ligoniel area of the city, which at the time was being rented by Gavin Hughes. When they arrived, police found Gavin's two brothers Gareth and Joseph at the property. Both the property and a vehicle parked outside the house were searched, and further packages of cocaine were seized, alongside items and equipment associated with mixing drugs. Also located during the search were 21 ecstasy tablets. The court heard it was the Crown's case that the rented property was being used to mix the cocaine and prepare it for sale. The total amount of cocaine seized on 9 and 10 October 2013 amounted to 3.25 kilos. The Hughes brothers subsequently pleaded guilty to a number of drugs offences, while Gerard Hughes also admitted two further offences - namely possession of cannabis with intent to supply, and possession of amphetamine on 6 August, 2013. These offences were linked to the seizure of drugs in a car park in east Belfast. Regarding the drugs seizures in October 2013, Gavin Hughes pleaded guilty to five charges, including possessing cocaine with intent to supply. He was handed a four-year sentence and was told he will serve a year in prison, with the remaining three years on licence upon his release. His brother Gerard - who appeared on charges arising from two separate incidents in August and October 2013 - was handed a sentence of five years. Half of this sentence will be spent in jail, with the remaining two years and six months on licence when he is released from prison. Joseph Hughes, who pleaded guilty to a single charge of possessing cocaine with intent to supply, was given a three-year sentence. Six months of this will be spent in jail, with the remaining 30 months on supervised licence upon his release.",

        "article": "Hundreds of nurses and midwives are expected to join a demonstration in London on Saturday calling for a rethink of plans to scrap maintenance grants for students in England. The Treasury says abolishing the grants, or bursaries, will allow many more nurses to be trained. But a Royal College of Nursing survey claims two-thirds of nurses wouldn't have studied nursing without them. They say it would make an existing staff shortage even worse. Bursaries are a means-tested allowance paid to those healthcare students who qualify, to help with living expenses during their training. Plans to scrap them were outlined by Chancellor George Osborne, as part of the government's Spending Review in November 2015. At the time he said the move would free up around \u00c2\u00a3800m a year in government spending and create up to 10,000 new training places. But since then, nurses and other health workers have been campaigning against the axing of bursaries. Student nurses are also going to have start paying tuition fees for their courses in the same way as other undergraduates - meaning they will have to take out a student loan. First year student nurse Ellie Archer has told the BBC that the bursary was vital in allowing her to pursue her dream career. She already has one sizeable student loan from another undergraduate degree and says: \"I really wanted to be a nurse and I can say without a doubt that if I had had to take out a loan to study to become a nurse, I would not have done it.\" Ellie believes the intensity of a nursing degree means students need extra support. \"Because of the amount of time spent on a placement it is very, very difficult to pick up second jobs, so there isn't really any other way of getting an income other than having the bursary in place.\" There is already a model of what a future without bursaries may look like at Chorley Hospital in Lancashire, which is part of the Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. Student nurses there, who are on a course run in conjunction with the University of Bolton, are the first in England to pay their own way and once they have successfully completed the course, they are guaranteed a job. The trust's director of nursing and midwifery Gail Naylor explains: \"We had 800 applicants for 30 places, so I think what that tells us is, there really is the demand out there. \"Students are looking for different ways to train and we've been really successful in that.\" The Lancashire course is not alone in being oversubscribed. In 2014, there were 57,000 applicants for places on nursing degree courses, but the NHS in England could fund only 20,000 places. The Royal College of Nursing says a survey of 17,000 nurses reveals that two-thirds of them would not have studied nursing if faced with the prospect of taking out a student loan. RCN chief executive Janet Davies says: \"We're concerned that perhaps we won't get the same diversity of people coming into nursing that we have currently, that having to take out a loan will put people off, particularly those people who are more mature, who may have had a career previously and who are coming into nursing as a second career.\" However, many of those who run nursing training courses believe there is a case for change. Dame Jessica Corner, chairwoman of the Councils of Deans of Health which represents the universities that train nurses, says: \"This change actually enables universities to open up training places. \"At the moment they are capped, really on the basis of affordability and estimates of what the NHS might need, which have clearly been wrong over many years. \"So over time we think training places will be expanded and that will be good news for the NHS with more nurses and allied health professionals graduating.\" There is a shortage of qualified NHS nurses right across the UK. So far these changes are only being proposed in England. But faced with similar problems, politicians in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will be watching very carefully to see what impact these changes will have.",

        "article": "Exams regulator Ofqual has confirmed the changes it is making to GCSEs, in what it calls the biggest shake-up of exams in England for a generation. A new grading system will use numbers instead of letters, and coursework is being scrapped for most subjects. The changes will be in stages, starting with pupils due to take GCSE exams in 2017. Those who turn 13 in this academic year will be the first. English and maths will be the first subjects affected. Pupils will begin studying the new courses in English language, English literature and maths from the autumn of 2015. And about 20 other popular GCSE subjects will be revamped in the same way, ready for teaching a year later, in 2016, with the first exams for those taken in 2018. The changes apply to England only. Wales is planning its own GCSE shake-up, but Northern Ireland is not planning any changes. Scotland has its own exams system. While they come in, pupils in England will have some exams graded with numbers and some with letters, leading teaching unions to warn this will be confusing for pupils, parents and employers. The GCSE changes being announced will apply only to pupils in England. Scotland has its own exam system, but Wales and Northern Ireland also use GCSEs. Wales is also planning a shake-up,  bringing in its own new GCSEs in maths, English and Welsh, which will be taught from the autumn of 2015. In Northern Ireland no changes to GCSEs are planned. A recent review concluded there was \"no case for replacing A-levels or GCSEs in the short or medium term\". Exams will be graded from 1 to 9, with 9 being the highest. Pupils who fail will be awarded a \"U\" for an unclassified result. All exams will be taken after two years of study, rather than in modules taken at various stages over two years, meaning a return to the format of O-levels, which pre-dated GCSEs. And there will be more marks awarded for spelling, punctuation and grammar. The head of Ofqual, Glenys Stacey, said the changes were \"fundamental\". \"This is the biggest change in a generation,\" she said. \"They [GCSEs] have been around for over 25 years but now we are seeing fresh content, a different structure, high-quality assessment coming in. \"It's a significant change for students and for schools.\" Ms Stacey said the move to a numerical system meant a new grade was being added and that would help examiners distinguish between candidates' performance - especially at the top grades. She suggested that the move away from traditional grades might be hard for some people to understand, but was important. \"The new qualifications will be significantly different and we need to signal this clearly,\" she said. At the same time, the government is confirming changes to what has to be studied in English language, English literature and maths, because the overhaul of exams covers both what is studied and how it is assessed. It says in English literature, students will have to \"study whole texts in detail, covering a range of literature including Shakespeare, 19th Century novels, Romantic poetry and other high-quality fiction and drama\". The new maths exam will cover more topics and will be more challenging, the government says. Details were released on Friday morning. For maths, Ofqual is keeping the present arrangement where pupils can be entered for either a higher- or lower-tier paper in maths, depending on their ability. But in English, that division has been scrapped and one exam will be taken by all. At the moment, students who are entered for easier papers can be awarded only the maximum of a C grade. The government says young people were let down by the old exam system; that frequent testing meant not enough time was spent on \"deep learning\" and not enough attention was paid to grammar, spelling and punctuation. Schools Minister Elizabeth Truss says the changes will improve students' \"core skills\" in maths and English and raise expectations. \"What we want to do is encourage schools to focus on those core skills that employers really want, because that is what is going to help our children get jobs when they leave school,\" she said. Headteachers' representative, the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), gave what it said was a \"cautious welcome\" to the changes. Deputy general secretary Malcolm Trobe said: \"There is much to welcome in today's announcement, especially the measured approach Ofqual has taken to this significant task. This announcement seals the introduction of changes that have been in the pipeline for a while. The moves amount to a big structural change to England's exam system and signal a clear break from the previous situation when students in England, Wales and Northern Ireland sat similar forms of GCSEs. The move towards \"linear\" assessment, where everything rests on exams taken at the end of two years, is already under way, but the announcement of the removal of coursework from most GCSE subjects cements that. As teachers, pupils and parents look ahead, they might wonder whether the alterations would survive any change in government. A general election is scheduled for May 2015 - months before the teaching for these new courses begins. Ofqual's Glenys Stacey says there is  a \"great deal of consensus that GCSEs need to reform\" and that she does not sense \"strong resistance\" to the changes from politicians. But there are clearly points on which the parties differ. \"We have always agreed that GCSE can be improved to better prepare students to meet the needs of the world we live in today.  But the constant tinkering with GCSEs we have had in the past has not been helpful.\" Unions representing classroom teachers warned that a shift away from coursework and having different levels of exams for different abilities could damage some pupils' education. Secondary school teacher and spokesman for the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, Jovan Trkulja, said that less able students could suffer. \"Exams are challenging and they should continue to be challenging. But we have to remember that setting the top of the mountain as the baseline means someone has to fall behind, and I feel for the sense of failure for the less able,\" he said. Shadow schools minister, Labour MP Kevin Brennan, said he had \"reservations\" about some aspects of the changes and that the move towards a numbered grading system was a step back to the 1970s. He said he agreed that the pendulum \"might have swung a little too far on coursework\", but there was now a danger that \"it will swing too far the other way\". \"Having everything staked on one final exam is not great for all pupils,\" he said.",

        "article": "There haven't been many good moments for Myanmar's Rohingya Muslims in the last four years. This country's dramatic political changes have passed them by. Greater democracy has not brought greater respect for the stateless Rohingya's human rights. But the formation of an Advisory Commission on Rakhine State represents a rare glimmer of hope. For the first time, the Burmese government is seeking international expertise to try and solve one of the country's most complex problems. It's a significant shift. For years, the official Burmese mantra has been that \"no foreigner can possibly understand Rakhine's problems\". Now Kofi Annan, the former UN secretary general, has been tasked with taking a fresh look at the issues as head of nine-member commission. His report could just add to the mountain of papers written about Rakhine and the Rohingya, or it just might be a game-changer. Will anyone help the Rohingya? Rohingya migrant crisis in 90 seconds The 'abandoned' people in Myanmar's election Aung San Suu Kyi where are you? So what's Aung San Suu Kyi up to? Well, first a cynical take. Next week the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon is due in the Burmese capital Nay Pyi Taw and in September Ms Suu Kyi will head to the United States for the UN General Assembly and talks with President Obama. The Nobel laureate was no doubt bracing herself for awkward questions about why she wasn't doing more to help Myanmar's Muslim minority and in particular the 800,000 or so Rohingya. Those questions can now be easily deflected with reference to this new commission. But there's more at play than that. By setting up the commission, Ms Suu Kyi is signalling that she is open to new ideas, and doesn't have all the answers. Kofi Annan may be 78 but, as you'd expect from a former UN secretary general, he's his own man. The final report, due to be delivered by the end of August 2017, is likely to contain suggestions that many Burmese consider unpalatable. Almost certainly it will insist that the Rohingya's basic human rights are respected, perhaps recommending that Myanmar offer them a better route to citizenship. In Myanmar's current political climate it's hard for Ms Suu Kyi to bring those ideas to the table. She'd be attacked not just by hardline Buddhists but many within her own party. So Kofi Annan and his report could be the \"Trojan Horse\" that brings this sort of proposal into the national debate. There are of course plenty of caveats. Problems as deeply entrenched as those between the Buddhist and Muslim communities in Rakhine State will not be solved overnight. The animosity between them has built up over decades with many in the Buddhist majority seeing the Rohingya as illegal immigrants from across the border in Bangladesh. After the violence of 2012, more than 100,000 Rohingya were forced from their homes into camps. In the years that have followed there's been no real effort to help them return. Rakhine has become increasingly segregated, with some comparing it to South Africa's apartheid. Things have become quieter but there's been little reconciliation. Whatever the commission ends up concluding, any move to give the Rohingya greater rights will be hugely controversial not just in Rakhine State but across the country. Vocal parts of the Buddhist community are openly hostile towards international aid agencies and the UN. They're unlikely to welcome Kofi Annan's team, no doubt anticipating the sort of recommendations he might make. Implementing any \"solution\" will be even harder. But the formation of this advisory commission is something new. However small, it's the first bit of positive news that the Rohingya have had for a long time.",

        "article": "India's bloody Maoist insurgency began in the remote forests of the state of West Bengal in the late 1960s. Several decades later it had become, in the words of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, India's \"greatest internal security challenge\". Maoists are also known as \"Naxalites\" because of the violent left-wing uprising in 1967, which began in the West Bengal village of Naxalbari. Although this was eventually quashed by police, over the years India's Maoists have regrouped and asserted control over vast swathes of land in central and eastern India, establishing a so-called \"red corridor\". This spans the states of Jharkand, West Bengal, Orissa, Bihar, Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh and also reaches into Uttar Pradesh, and Karnataka. The Maoists and affiliated groups are active in more than a third of India's 600-odd districts, the authorities say. And more than 6,000 people have died in the rebels' long fight for communist rule in these states. The Maoists' military leader is Koteshwar Rao, otherwise known as Kishenji. He reportedly suffered temporary paralysis in June 2010 when a police bullet hit him in the knee. Normally a regular communicator with the press, Kishenji was little heard of until January 2011 when he issued a statement saying he expected India to succumb to a Maoist revolution by 2025. Latest estimates suggest he commandes at least 20,000 armed fighters. They are said to get most of their weapons by raiding police bases. Analysts say the longevity of the Maoist rebellion is partly due to the local support they receive. The rebels say they are fighting for the rights of indigenous tribespeople and the rural poor who they say have been neglected by governments for decades. Maoists claim to represent local concerns over land ownership and equitable distribution of resources. Ultimately they say they want to establish a \"communist society\" by overthrowing India's \"semi-colonial, semi-feudal\" form of rule through armed struggle. The BBC's Subir Bhaumik in Calcutta says that while there is little prospect of them making any headway in urban areas - or indeed non-jungle rural areas - the rebels remain a force to be reckoned with in remote areas where the security forces are thin on the ground. Our correspondent says the key question now is whether to deploy the army against the rebels in the same way it has been used in Indian-administered Kashmir and some north-eastern states. Such a move would be highly controversial, because it would inevitably been seen by some critics as evidence that the rebels are making headway in what is seen by some as \"mainland India\". Over the years the Maoists have managed to launch a series of damaging attacks on Indian security forces. In 2009, rebels gained virtual control of Lalgarh district in West Bengal barely 250km (155 miles) from the state capital, Calcutta. For many months, rebels, supported by local villagers, held hundreds of paramilitary forces at bay. The Maoists declared it to be India's first \"liberated zone\" but Indian security forces finally overwhelmed the rebels. April 2010 saw rebels ambush paramilitary troops in the dense jungles of central Chhattisgarh state, killing at least 76 soldiers. Correspondents say it was the worst-ever Maoist attack on Indian security forces. In 2007, also in Chhattisgarh, Maoist rebels killed 55 policemen in an attack on a remote police outpost. Almost every week, Maoist rebels are blamed for minor skirmishes and incidents across India's north-east - common tactics include blowing up railway tracks and attacking police stations. In 2010, the Maoists faced India's biggest ever anti-Maoist offensive. Nearly 50,000 federal paramilitary troops and tens of thousands of policemen took part in the operation across several states. While the rebels were pushed back deep into their jungle strongholds, they have continued to carry out hit-and-run attacks and numerous high-profile kidnappings. India's government in turn has pledged to crack down even harder unless rebels renounce violence and enter peace talks. At the same time there have been differences not just within the central government over how to tackle the rebellion, but also between Delhi and various Indian states affected by the insurgency. Experts say that disagreements over whether to deploy the army against the rebels is a manifestation of these tensions. On one issue however the analysts remain united - the chances of any kind of meaningful dialogue with the rebels in the foreseeable future are slim.",

        "article": "So would the Welsh economy be weaker without the M4 Black Route - or for that matter without any M4 upgrade? That question is even more pertinent as Labour and Plaid Cymru talk about what they can and cannot agree on. Much of the so called \"economic\" debate has been about its cost - whether we can afford \u00a31bn, and whether the cheaper Blue Route would be a better option . That is a very different question from whether the Welsh economy would be stronger with it, and weaker without. There is little disagreement that the M4 between Cardiff West services and Magor, east of Newport, is regularly congested. And that slows down the A48M and the A470. There's also little disagreement that the M4 is busiest around Newport, partly because of the unusually large number of junctions which encourages local people use the motorway as a route between the various suburbs of the city. To really understand the problems we need to look at where employment in south east Wales has grown up over the last twenty years. Much of it has been developed on new sites along the motorway. It was part of the old Welsh Development Agency's policy in the late 1980s and early 90s to build big business parks, easily accessible by car. Imperial Park, Celtic Springs, Cleppa Park and Cardiff Gate are all examples of that. Many thousands of commuters travel between the Severn Bridge and at least as far west as Swansea to work for companies on those parks. These developments, and the work they offer, have also been a magnet to people living in the Gwent and Rhymney valleys who may have found it a challenge getting work closer to home. Significantly, the Welsh Government's document arguing for the Black Route clearly shows that the highest concentration of traffic is not at Brynglas but at Tredegar Park, where the main road from the Gwent valleys, the M4, the A48 and a host of industrial parks all meet. The cheaper Blue Route would take westbound traffic off the M4 east of Newport but it is hard to see how it would affect the many thousands who travel south towards the motorway. The big question in terms of easing congestion is how much the Metro integrated road-and-rail transport network will change commuters' patterns. It partly depends on whether the full Metro plans are implemented, how well and how quickly. Importantly, the proposed network does include a station at Cleppa Park - the centre of the family of business parks to the west of Newport - and other stops that may tempt people out of their cars. There is also a station planned for the Royal Gwent Hospital. If we had a public transport system that carried people from where they tend to live to where the work is - and where they want to go for shopping and hospital visits - then would we need a whole new motorway? The economic argument for the M4 Black Route centres on time and money lost due to congestion, the poor image that gives of Wales as a modern place to do businesses, and the theory that concentrations of economic activity tend to multiply more quickly than if businesses are more isolated. Wales' economic weakness centres around having too high a proportion of low-skilled low-value jobs, not enough headquarters, and not enough innovation . Perhaps the biggest question is not about the price of an upgrade of the M4, but what Wales will get from it. It's not really about \u00a31bn or \u00a3380m - it's about what we get from that. How much would either route answer the really big challenges of the Welsh economy? Would Wales become home to more research and development, for instance, with speedier travel along the M4?

        "filtered_resps": "The M4 Black Route is a key factor in the Welsh economy, with many commuters traveling between the Severn Bridge and as far west as Swansea for work. The upgrade of the M4 has been a topic of debate, with some arguing that it would be more cost-effective to build a Blue Route. However, little disagreement exists that the M4 is regularly congested and slows down the A48M and the A470. The M4 Black Route was part of the old Welsh Development Agency's policy to build big business parks, and many thousands of commuters travel between the Severn Bridge and at least as far west as Swansea to work for companies on those parks. The Welsh Government's document arguing for the Black Route shows that the highest concentration of traffic is not at Brynglas but at Tredegar Park. The Blue Route would take westbound traffic off the M4 east of Newport, but it is unclear how it would affect the many thousands who travel south towards the motorway. The economic argument for the M4 Black Route centers on time and money lost due to congestion, the poor image that gives of Wales as a modern place to do businesses, and the theory that concentrations of economic activity tend to multiply more quickly than if businesses are more isolated. The author suggests that the upgrade of the M4 could answer some of the really big challenges of the Welsh economy, such as encouraging new or growing tech firms to be headquartered in Wales.",

        "article": "Former Congolese rebel leader Jean-Pierre Bemba has been found guilty of war crimes in a landmark trial at the International Criminal Court (ICC). Bemba, 53, was accused of failing to stop his rebels from killing and raping people in neighbouring Central African Republic (CAR) in 2002 and 2003. He had sent more than 1,000 fighters to help put down an attempted coup. Bemba, once vice-president of the Democratic Republic of Congo, will remain in custody until sentencing. The court in The Hague found him guilty of several charges including rape and murder. He is expected to appeal. It is the first time the ICC has focused on rape as a weapon of war, and the first time a suspect has been convicted over crimes committed by others under his command. The fact that Bemba was convicted for sexual violence is significant. Many Congolese suspects have been accused of such crimes, but this is the first guilty verdict. His conviction was for crimes committed in the Central African Republic, but it will send the message to high-ranking soldiers and militiamen in DR Congo, where sexual violence is rife, that they are responsible for preventing it. But in Congo, despite his murky record, Jean-Pierre Bemba still enjoys significant popularity. Members of his opposition party had hoped he would be released in time to run in the next presidential election, which is scheduled for the end of this year. Welcoming the verdict, ICC chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said: \"While the reality of the crimes is appalling, the significance of this decision is to be celebrated. \"What this decision affirms is that commanders are responsible for the acts of the forces under their control.\" Carrie Comer, from the International Federation for Human Rights, said the verdict was \"a historic moment for victims of such unspeakable atrocities\". It was \"a strong message from ICC judges that commanders must prevent and punish war crimes,\" she wrote on Twitter. It is alleged that for a period of five months Bemba's Movement for the Liberation of Congo (MLC) rebel fighters killed hundred of civilians, raped women and looted. The court heard horrific accounts, including how a man, his wife, his daughters and his granddaughter were all gang-raped by militiamen. Who is Jean-Pierre Bemba? Profile: Jean-Pierre Bemba More about DR Congo Bemba's lawyers argued that once the troops had crossed the border they were no longer under his command, but under the then-CAR President Ange-Felix Patasse. But the presiding judge ruled that Bemba had effective control over the troops and was therefore \"criminally responsible\". Mr Bemba led the MLC during DR Congo's brutal civil war. He is the son of a prominent businessman and a former assistant to ex-Congolese President Mobutu Sese Seko. After a peace deal in DR Congo in 2003, he laid down his arms and joined an interim government. Bemba is the most senior figure to face judgement at the court and only the third person to be convicted since the court's founding in 2002. Germain Katanga and Thomas Lubanga, both Congolese former warlords, have previously been found guilty of offences. What does this verdict mean for the ICC? This is a rare success for a beleaguered institution. It is the court's first conviction for rape as a war crime and establishes the principle that commanders are responsible for the actions of their subordinates. Why have there been so few convictions? The cases are often complex and so it takes a long time to go through the evidence. There are also logistical problems such as bringing witnesses from remote areas and organising translators. However, some cases have collapsed, most notably that of Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta. Why are most of its cases in Africa? This is a question African leaders have often asked - they say the many African cases are evidence of discrimination. Critics say leaders such as Mr Kenyatta and Sudan's Omar al-Bashir have used accusations of bias as a smokescreen to evade justice. One former president, Ivory Coast's Laurent Gbagbo, is on trial accused of war crimes. And the ICC is investigating non-African cases. What is the International Criminal Court?",

        "article": "Manchester United are likely to limit their summer spending to three or four key signings. United will be in the Champions League and boss Jose Mourinho said executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward has had his targets \"for more than two months\". Mourinho wants to enhance his forward and defensive options to challenge for the Premier League title next season. United have been linked with Atletico Madrid striker Antoine Griezmann and Burnley centre-back Michael Keane. \"Ed Woodward has my list,\" the Portuguese manager said after his side beat Ajax to win the Europa League for the first time on Wednesday. \"Now it's up to him and the owners.\" Griezmann has a 100m euro release clause in his contract and the 26-year-old France international said earlier this week that his chances of joining United were \"six out of 10\". Since then, a major stumbling block has been removed by United securing the return of Champions League football. They will go straight into the group stage after their victory over Ajax in Stockholm. Griezmann has the pace and trickery United lack but, should a move falter, Torino forward Andrea Belotti is another option. The 23-year-old Italy international has scored 25 goals in Serie A this season. Keane, meanwhile, left United for Burnley in January 2015 but Mourinho is known to be eager to bring the 24-year-old defender back to Old Trafford. The Portuguese views predecessor Louis van Gaal's decision to sell the centre-back for \u00a32m as a mistake and believes his central defensive options are limited. In theory, a 25% sell-on clause agreed at the time of that deal should bring the price down. However, Burnley manager Sean Dyche has said the Clarets have no financial need to sell Keane, who made his England debut in March. Prior to the January transfer window, United showed interest in Benfica's Sweden centre-back Victor Lindelof, 22, while left-back is another area of weakness. Earning Champions League football means United have avoided the potential loss of \u00a350m in sponsorship income and prize money. However, one senior club source said the forthcoming transfer window was likely to be \"crazy\", given the increased spending power within the Premier League as a result of the new \u00a38.3bn TV deal and clubs such as Inter Milan and AC Milan willing to spend big to try to rediscover former glories. A year ago, Mourinho marked his first summer at Old Trafford by bringing in striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic, defender Eric Bailly and midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan by the first week in July, before midfielder Paul Pogba re-signed from Juventus for a world record \u00a389m in early August. In December, BBC Sport was told the United manager felt he needed at least two more transfer windows to shape his squad. Mourinho decided not to buy in January, but since then Ibrahimovic and defender Marcos Rojo have suffered cruciate knee-ligament injuries which will keep them out until next year and former Germany midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger has left for Major League Soccer in the United States. United went on to finish sixth in the Premier League which, apart from the disastrous campaign under David Moyes in 2013-14, was their lowest placing since 1991.",

Australian Matthews, 25, of Orica-BikeExchange won a sprint finish ahead of Peter Sagan and Edvald Boasson Hagen to claim his first Tour victory. Slovak Sagan took the green points jersey from Briton Mark Cavendish. Defending champion Froome finished in the peloton, nine minutes 39 seconds behind Matthews, on the 197km stage from Escaldes-Engordany to Revel. Britain's Adam Yates, Matthews' 23-year-old team-mate, was in the same group to keep the white jersey for best young rider. 2013 and 2015 winner Froome and his main rivals enjoyed a relatively comfortable day, which started with a big climb but flattened out to suit a breakaway win. The main contenders for the yellow jersey were happy to let a group of 15 riders - none of whom threatened the overall lead - surge ahead. Britain's Steve Cummings, who won stage seven, was part of the breakaway but dropped back as two Orica team-mates helped Matthews earn an emotional win. Matthews said he came close to \"giving up\" on the Tour de France after breaking four ribs in a crash last year, and missing the 2014 race following an accident. But his win continued Orica's impressive Tour, with Yates second in the general classification standings, 16 seconds behind Froome. While Yates has produced some superb solo performances, Matthews was helped by team-mates Luke Durbridge and Daryl Impey as they neutralised the threat of Tinkoff's world champion Sagan. Durbridge's pace reduced the breakaway to seven riders before he dropped out, with Impey launching several attacks in the last few kilometres. Matthews waited until the final 200m to make his move, overtaking BMC's Greg van Avermaet and Sagan in the last 50m. \"To have won a stage after two really bad years in the Tour de France, the emotion is just sinking in,\" said Matthews, who has also won stages at the Giro d'Italia and Vuelta a Espana. \"I was close to giving up on this race, thinking it was maybe not for me, but today was incredible. \"It was never the plan to go in the breakaway. We were hoping for bunch sprint after the last climb but we had strong guys, and whoever is up we give them 110%. Daryl and Luke gave me everything.\" Sagan overtook Cavendish in the green jersey standings after winning the intermediate sprint and finishing second to Matthews. Cavendish, who has won three stages in this year's race, finished in the peloton and now trails Sagan by 38 points. Sagan has won the green jersey in each of the past four years, and Manxman Cavendish, 31, said before this year's race that he cannot beat the world champion. Cavendish, whose tally of 29 career stage wins is bettered only by Eddy Merckx's 34, could challenge for a 30th on a largely flat stage 11, which takes the riders 162.5km (101 miles) from Carcassonne to Montpellier. 1.

The Daggers, who reached League One in 2010, needed victory to keep their slim survival hopes alive. Goals from Jamie Cureton and Clevid Dikamona gave them hope after Jay Simpson fired the O's into a 2-0 lead. But Armand Gnanduillet fired in the winner to relegate Dagenham and keep Orient's play-off hopes alive. Dagenham reached the Football League for the first time in their history in 2007, but they now return to the National League under John Still, the same manager who took the club from the Conference to League One. The Daggers have League Two's worst goal difference, and have conceded 20 goals more this season than they had at this point last term. Still's side have also struggled in attack, with 40-year-old striker Jamie Cureton netting nine goals, compared to the 20 he scored as Dagenham finished 14th in the 2014-15 campaign. Boss Still, who returned for his third spell at the club in December, told BBC Radio London on Wednesday that he is committed to helping the Daggers gain promotion from the National League next season. Victory leaves Orient two points adrift of the play-off spots and comes four days after player-manager Kevin Nolan was removed from his managerial role. Leyton Orient interim manager Andy Hessenthaler told BBC Radio London: Media playback is not supported on this device \"For me to lose two managers this season has been very tough and I've found it very hard this week. \"We had to be professional, we're here to do a job and if I wasn't professional then I wouldn't be true to myself. \"We owe it to the fans. At the end of the day there's nobody bigger than the football club - the fans are the biggest part of the football club. \"We made it a little bit nervy because we gave two sloppy goals away, but in the end that's what we need to do now - we need to win games if we're going to get into the play-offs.\" Dagenham & Redbridge manager John Still told BBC Radio London: \"I think for half an hour in the first half we lacked organisation and lacked discipline. \"If you haven't got organisation and you haven't got the discipline to play 90 minutes, the outcome is inevitable. \"Dagenham over the years are going to get beat, it's responding to that that the club's not been able to do this year.\"",

Prison Link Cymru had 1,099 referrals in 2015-16 and said some ex-offenders were living rough for up to a year before finding suitable accommodation. Workers at the charity claim investment in housing would be cheaper than jailing homeless repeat offenders. The Welsh Government said more people than ever were getting help to address housing problems. Changes to the Housing Act in Wales, introduced in 2015, removed the right for prison leavers to be given priority for accommodation. Prison Link Cymru, which helps people find accommodation after their release, said things were generally good for women because issues such as children or domestic violence were now considered. However, the same could not be said for men, the charity said, because issues which often affect them, such as post traumatic stress disorder or drug dependency, were often viewed as less of a priority. Andrew Stevens, who works in Welsh prisons trying to secure housing for prison leavers, said the need for accommodation was \"chronic\". \"There's a desperate need for it, finding suitable accommodation for those leaving prison there is just a lack of it everywhere,\" he said. \"It could take six months to a year, without a lot of help they could be on the streets for six months. \"When you think of the consequences of either being on the street, especially with the cold weather at the moment or you may have a roof over your head, sometimes there is only one choice.\" Mr Stevens believes building more one-bedroom flats could help ease the problem. \"The average price is a hundred pounds a week to keep someone in a rented flat, prison is a lot more than that so I would imagine it would save the public purse quite a few pounds,\" he said. Official figures show 830 one-bedroom properties were built in the year to March 2016, of an overall total of 6,900 new properties in Wales. Marc, 50, who has been in and out of prison for the past 20 years for burglary offences, said he struggled to find accommodation each time he was released. He said he would ask himself: \"Where am I going to stay? Where am I going to live? Have I got somewhere where I can see my daughter.\" \"You're put out among the same sort of people doing the same sort of thing, and it's difficult, it's difficult to get away from it. It's like every man for himself, there's nothing.\" Marc has now found stable accommodation with homeless charity Emmaus and said it had been life changing. \"You feel safe, you got hot food, you've got company of people in similar situations to yourself but all dealing with different issues. It's a constructive, helpful atmosphere,\" he said. Tom Clarke, chief executive of Emmaus South Wales, agreed there was not enough support available. \"We do still see [people] homeless on the streets, so clearly they haven't got accommodation and haven't got provision,\" he said. \"I think the key is connecting people with the services they need. I don't delude myself that Emmaus can offer a one size fits all for everyone, we can't. \"But there must be other opportunities and given suitable encouragement I believe that can and should happen.\" A Welsh Government spokesman said the national pathway for homeless services to children, young people and adults in the secure estate had prevented many people from losing their home whilst serving their prison sentence. It added there were already significant demands for one-bedroom flats across the public and private sector and it was providing 20,000 new affordable homes in the next five years.",

        "article": "Spending two hours commuting each day is a reality for many UK workers, says data that suggests Britons are willing to travel further and longer. Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures show 3.7 million workers travel for two hours or longer every weekday. Frances O'Grady of the Trades Union Congress, which published the figures, called on employers to do more to prevent \"excessive\" journeys. The average daily commute lasted 57.1 minutes in 2015, the ONS data showed. Ms O'Grady blamed stagnant wages for bulging commuting times, paired with high house prices and rental costs. \"Employers cannot turn a blind eye to this problem,\" she said. \"Long commutes eat into our family time and can be bad for our working lives too.\" Back in 2010, 2.8 million people made daily commutes of two hours or more, compared with 3.7 million today, according to the ONS's Labour Force Survey. The survey, which is based on responses from nearly 90,000 workers and excludes those who work from home, found that: The TUC said workers were now less likely to be able to afford to live near their places of work. The cost of renting a home in the UK rose faster than the cost of living in the year to September, according to ONS figures. Meanwhile, UK property prices saw an 8.4% annual increase up to August. Longer periods travelling to and from work have therefore become an accepted part of many people's daily routine. \"It makes life difficult but it's become the norm,\" said Nick Seymour, a solicitor from Exeter, who spends at least three hours a day travelling by car and train to and from Bristol. Once a week, he also travels to his firm's office in Cardiff - a four-hour-plus round-trip. \"I've been doing this for months and am surprised how many people do the same route,\" he said. Mr Seymour, 43, said the \u00c2\u00a35,000 cost of train tickets, not including petrol and parking, was worth it to avoid the upheaval of relocating. \"I am considering moving, but my wife and son are based here in Exeter,\" he said. The compromise is missing out on eight-year-old son Harry's parents' evenings and school plays - not to mention delays and crowded trains. \"It can be a daily nightmare,\" he said. \"I normally stand because it's too busy, which is frustrating if you've had a long day.\" Other commuters are going to great lengths to avoid overcrowded or delayed trains. Phil Cresswell, who works in media advertising, cycles 230 miles a week on his daily journey from Leatherhead in Surrey to central London. He says spending his \"14th winter\" on the bicycle is worth it to save \"several thousands of pounds a year\" on train tickets as well as the cost of a gym membership. \"I live on the edge of the Surrey hills and it's great for cycling,\" he said. Mr Cresswell, 51, admits that some people think the 46-mile round trip is extreme. \"But I think sitting on trains or buses for similar times going nowhere is extreme,\" he said. Another unconventional commuter is Sam Cookney, who recently packed in his own five-and-a-half-hour round trip between Barcelona and London. In a blog post in 2013, he explained that flying from Barcelona for four days a week was cheaper than renting a flat in the capital. Mr Cookney, 33, moved to Barcelona last year but decided making the trip four times a week would be \"excessive\", and instead travelled to London a few times a month. \"Sadly I'm no longer commuting and living back in London,\" he said.",

The PM attended a summit of EU leaders in Brussels before leaving while they discussed their approach to Brexit. The remaining 27 agreed that the European Commission will take the lead role in negotiations. Meanwhile Chancellor Philip Hammond has played down suggestions it could take ten years to reach a trade deal. He told the BBC:  \"I don't expect that it will take as long as that,\" following reports that Britain's ambassador to the EU, Sir Ivan Rogers, suggested that others in Europe believed this could be the case. The prime minister was in Brussels on Thursday for a European Council meeting. She left the summit without answering any questions on Brexit but Irish PM Enda Kenny told reporters that she had given an update on the Supreme Court case the UK government is involved with on whether it can act alone in triggering Article 50 - the formal start of Brexit. He added: \"She would like to have the question of UK citizens living in Europe and European citizens living in the UK dealt with in the early part of discussions that take place.\" A Downing St spokesman confirmed on Friday that the prime minister had raised the issue and been clear she would like to see the issue resolved as soon as possible. He said: \"We have been very clear we want to extend those rights to EU citizens here, as long as there are reciprocal arrangements for British citizens across the EU.\" The question of what will happen to the estimated 2.9 million citizens of other EU countries who have made their home in the UK in recent years is one of the most controversial arising from the UK's vote to leave the EU in June's referendum. The government has said it expects an early resolution of the issue once official talks on the terms of the UK's separation from the EU begin, something it plans to happen by next spring. But it has not given any guarantees on their future status - saying this is impossible without similar safeguards for the estimated 1.2 million Britons living in Spain, France, Italy and other EU countries. Mr Kenny also told reporters that the Irish Republic would not sign a bilateral trade deal with the UK and the UK had to agree its future relationship with the EU first. Pictures from the summit which circulated on social media appeared to show Mrs May looking as though she had no one to talk to. However the BBC's Europe editor Katya Adler said other clips showed her chatting to EU leaders while German MP Stephan Mayer said reports of the PM being frozen out were \"misleading\". Mr Mayer, who is home affairs spokesperson for the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, also told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that it was \"reasonable\" for the 27 EU leaders to meet without Mrs May, following the formal summit, to discuss their approach to Brexit. The 27 agreed that European Commission official Michel Barnier will lead talks for the EU - although MEPs are said to want a greater say. European Council president Donald Tusk said the \"short, informal meeting\" had \"reconfirmed our principles, meaning the indivisibility of the four freedoms, the balance of rights and obligations and the rule 'no negotiations without notification'\". European Parliament president Martin Schulz has warned that negotiations could be vetoed if MEPs are not fully involved. Downing Street meanwhile has indicated that it would be possible to complete a \"divorce deal\" and a new trade agreement with the EU within the timetabled two years of the UK invoking Article 50 - the formal start of the process of leaving. But Germany's Mr Mayer said that it would be \"a bit naive\" to think a trade deal could be done in two years. \"It's very ambitious to finish these negotiations within two years, it's a huge project.\" Chancellor Philip Hammond told the BBC the UK would negotiate a Brexit deal and, once that has started, would \"in parallel\" begin to negotiate new trade arrangements with the EU. Meanwhile, reports suggest that Britain could face a \u00c2\u00a350bn bill to leave the EU, including payments to cover pension liabilities for EU staff. Downing Street said the UK would meet its obligations while in the EU, but any financial settlement after that would be a matter for negotiation. At the summit, the leaders also discussed Syria, controlling mass migration into Europe, the EU's relationship with Ukraine, co-operation with Nato and economic matters.",

        "article": "As leisure activities go, you would imagine that lying naked on a wooden table while two topless Russian men hit your back with bunches of oak leaves would only appeal to a very specialist group of enthusiasts. Yet while such a prospect would make most of us run a mile, this is in fact a traditional massage method in Russia. Called a \"venik\" massage, the oak bunches are first softened in warm water. And rather than being whacked on your back in anger, they are gently and rhythmically applied. It is a popular treatment in the thousands of steam bathhouses, or \"banyas\", across Russia. The massage, which takes place in a sauna room set at a temperature of 70C, is said to boost circulation and prevent premature ageing of the skin. And after the treatment has finished you are supposed to immediately jump into a plunge pool of cold water. You might think that such an unusual massage would struggle to be successfully exported from Russia, but the co-founder of the first banya in London says that two years after opening, almost half of its customers are non-Russians. Launching the banya, called Banya No.1, was the dream of entrepreneurial Russian ex-pat Ksenia Bobkova. The 37-year-old has lived in the UK for more than 20 years after moving from St Petersburg to study law at Edinburgh University in 1994. After graduating from Edinburgh she has had a successful career in finance in London, first working at a large commercial law firm, and then co-founding a new investment company. Yet as much as Ms Bobkova says she has always enjoyed living in the UK, the one thing she really missed was regular trips to a banya. After dreaming of opening London's first banya for more than a decade, Ms Bobkova says that in 2012 \"the circumstances came together\" to enable her to finally start work on it. Firstly, she realised that more and more Russians were now living in London, which she hoped would make a banya commercially viable, and she had built up enough savings to launch the business. Then she found the right building, and two other UK-based Russian investors came on board. After a year of construction work, including importing a traditional banya stove from Russia, the bathhouse opened its doors in 2013. \"When we wrote the business plan, we certainly focused on the fact that the Russian-speaking community in London had grown substantially over the past 15 years,\" she says. \"But after we opened we soon discovered that London is so international, and that people who live here are so open to new experiences, that almost half our customers are non-Russian.\" Customers - both male and female - who don't want to strip naked can instead wear their swimming costume, or a strategically placed towel. And for people who wish to avoid the oak leaves, Scandinavian-style, hands-based back massages are also available. After the massages, people are encouraged to stay and relax in a lounge or rest area, where they can order traditional Russian food. While Ms Bobkova is reluctant to discuss how financially successful the banya is, it is often full, and typical visits cost \u00c2\u00a3100 per person. And she now plans to open more branches. Running the banya is a world apart from Ms Bobkova's main job of helping to lead investment firm Fusion Asset Management, of which she was a founding partner in 2004. The business invests millions of pounds globally on behalf of large institutions, and has a sister office in Moscow. While the original six founders included one Englishman, an American and a Frenchman, it is now owned and run by three London-based Russian ex-pats. Ms Bobkova says that she likes working in the UK, because she values what she describes as \"British fair play\" in business. \"Without comparing specifically to Russia, what is very fundamental in British business ethics is this concept of fair play,\" she says. \"[Doing business in the UK means] you can trust people, and people will generally not try to squeeze you too much. In the UK both sides get a fairly allocated share of the profit, rather than one gets all, and the other gets nothing.\" In terms of her day-to-day style as a boss she says that while she has high expectations of staff, it is a point of principle that the 20 people at the finance firm don't have to work late nights or at weekends. \"Nothing in the world is so important that it needs to be done at the weekend,\" she says. In addition to the two businesses, Ms Bobkova is also a co-founder of a networking organisation for Russians living and working in London. Called Russians in the City, and with 2,300 members, it holds quarterly events, such as drinks parties, or polo matches and skiing trips. The world is getting wealthier - but with the gap between rich and poor feeling bigger than ever, who are the winners and losers of this richer world in 2015? A Richer World 2015 Listen to the reports and documentaries The organisation has since opened a sister branch in Switzerland, with other ones due to open in New York and Dubai. A UK passport holder, and previously married to a British husband, Ms Bobkova says that Russians in the City allow her to maintain the Russian side of her identity. \"I'm British in that I have lived here for 20 years, but I'm also obviously Russian,\" she says. \"There are different categories of immigrants. Some are so integrated that they almost deny where they came from, while at the other end, some people don't integrate at all. \"I'm somewhere in the middle, I'm fully integrated, I went to a British university... I speak English.... but I also like my Russian heritage, which I nurture through the bathhouse and through the network.\"",

        "article": "Water experts are calling on ministers to show greater leadership on flooding. They say the government is failing to promote back-to-nature schemes which protect lowland homes by deliberately creating floods in the hills. The Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management (CIWEM) say upland schemes to slow river flow cost a fraction of conventional flood walls \u2013 and should be spread round the UK. Ministers back the principle but say the details need to be worked out. The idea of creating floods upstream to prevent floods downstream was a key message from the Pitt Review into the 2007 floods. A handful of pilot projects have pioneered cheap small-scale measures like felling trees into streams to slow down the flow, and building earth banks to catch run-off water and allow it to soak away. One low-tech scheme in the hills above Belford in Northumberland cost about \u00a3300,000. It was put in place after a study suggested the cost of conventional flood defences would cost \u00a34m. But progress nationally has been slow, with funding a major problem. Katherine Pygott, from CIWEM, told the BBC: \u201cFlooding is getting worse with changing weather patterns, but these schemes are taking a very long time and a lot of energy. \u201cProjects working with nature to reduce flood risk are needed right across the country but it is complicated with many different organisations involved and it will need political leadership from the highest level to make it happen. So far we haven\u2019t seen that leadership.\u201d The upland schemes are designed to reduce the regularity of flooding, not remove risk completely. Conventional flood defences will still be needed but CIWEM estimates that re-wilding rivers will save ten of millions by reducing the peak flow and lowering the specification for flood walls. The projects should also benefit wildlife. Phil Welton, from the Environment Agency, says the UK should aspire to have \"a pond in every field in the areas where flood prevention is needed. \"We have got to give incentives to farmers to persuade them to capture water on their land,\" he argues. \"Farmers will lose a bit of land \u2013 but these areas are only wet for two to three days a year and quite often they are on bits of land that farmers don't use \u2013 boggy areas or buffer strips.\u201d Incentives for farmers are one key sticking point. In theory, funds from the Common Agricultural Policy can be used for catchment management but in practice Ms Pygott says that the standard of proof is much higher than for biodiversity projects which can also be supported under the CAP. \u201cWith biodiversity schemes a farmer simply has to show that he has changed the land in a way that\u2019s expected to benefit wildlife,\" she adds. \"With flood schemes they have to prove what the benefits will be and that\u2019s very hard. \"We obviously don\u2019t want to be wasting government money on the wrong projects but with weather patterns changing it really makes sense to take a leap of faith on this and say it\u2019s obvious these schemes are going to help if you get them in the right place.\u201d While farmers\u2019 union NFU supports the idea in principle, it maintains it is not a \"panacea\" and will not alleviate flood risk in all parts of the country. \"It is most beneficial in steeper catchments where rainfall is quickly funnelled into rivers that can result in high peaks in flows,\" its flood adviser Ian Moodie warned. \u201cThe measures are less likely to be beneficial within lowland areas such as the Somerset Levels where we\u2019ve seen a lot of flooding in recent years.\u201d Taking the pilot schemes into upland areas nationwide will not be easy. CIWEM say thousands of farms need to be visited and surveyed to see where micro-schemes can be placed to protect catchments \u2013 a tough demand when Defra and the Environment Agency are shedding staff. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson told the BBC he was \"passionate about keeping water in the uplands but details of how to do this need to be resolved\". CIWEM say the quickest results for back-to-nature drainage will come in areas where land is owned by a few people. For instance, near Pickering in Yorkshire, flood zones are being created and moorland drains stuffed with heather with the co-operation of just three large landowners including the Forestry Commission. It was the need for forestry and farm output which saw the UK\u2019s uplands drained in the first place when the farm department MAFF urged landowners to maximize productivity to overcome the U-boats during the Second World War. Nearly seven decades later there\u2019s still no concerted nationwide attempt to keep the rain on the uplands where it falls. Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin",

        "article": "They fought against Hitler and helped rebuild Britain - yet the contributions of thousands of men and women from Caribbean colonies during World War Two have been largely forgotten. Some 10,000 left their families and homes to join the British armed forces, working behind the scenes and on the frontline to defeat the Nazis. \"We were British subjects and that was something to be proud of,\" said Victor Brown, a Jamaican who fought with the Merchant Navy. Although Britain was initially reluctant to let black people join the war effort, the rules were relaxed as the war progressed and casualties mounted. Enthusiasm to defend \"King and Empire\" was widespread across the Caribbean and Mr Brown, like thousands of others, was quick to sign up. In 1942, he was one of only two black men serving on an oil tanker in the North Atlantic when it was torpedoed by the Nazis. He is credited with saving several lives on board and still remembers the incident vividly. \"We rushed out to the deck and we could see the periscope out of the water,\" he said. As the ship listed, he used an axe to cut down a lifeboat, and cleared the vessel. \"If we had have left it, the ship would have eventually dragged the lifeboat down with it,\" he said. Winston Murphy, the only other black member of the 42-strong crew, was among the survivors. Seventy years on he said he has never forgotten his friend's quick thinking. \"Had he not chopped that rope we would never have got clear of that boat,\" he added. The friends, now aged 94, swapped stories during a recent reunion. \"It's almost like a miracle,\" said Mr Brown. \"I never thought we'd live long enough to meet again after all the years we've been separated.\" The pair were lucky to survive. The death toll for black merchant seamen during World War Two was high. Thousands perished, while others died serving with the Royal Air Force and the Army. Allan Wilmot, from Jamaica, volunteered to join the Royal Navy in 1941 when he was just 15. \"Being young you didn't realise the danger until you were actually there. You hear the guns fire and realise this ain't no joke,\" he said. Away from the frontline, life also presented challenges. Many servicemen struggled to adapt to Britain's cold climate and had to fend off racial prejudice. \"Being British you feel like you are coming home but when we came here it was like we dropped out of the sky. Nobody knew anything about us,\" said Mr Wilmot. Those who survived the war were given the chance to return to their home countries, but many opted to remain in Britain and created an enduring multicultural legacy. Jake Jacobs served as an equipment assistant with the RAF at Burtonwood. He briefly returned to Trinidad after his period of service came to an end, but returned to Britain in search of work. He fell in love and married a local woman, prompting a backlash from members of the public who disagreed with mixed-race relationships. \"They just went dumb. They just stared,\" explained his wife Mary from their home in Solihull. The pair struggled to find accommodation after their wedding and Mrs Jacobs lost touch with members of her family. \"I spent days and days crying,\" she added. Nevertheless the couple persevered. Ex-servicemen were offered jobs by the state and Mr Jacobs began working in telecommunications. Like thousands of his former colleagues he stayed to help rebuild post-war Britain, changing its cultural landscape forever. Despite their countless sacrifices, some veterans feel their war time experiences have been forgotten and have spent their lifetimes fighting for equality. Sam King MBE was born in Jamaica in 1926 and served as a ground crew engineer with the RAF. \"I don't think we are being recognised for our contribution,\" he said. \"Many young people don't realise that so many volunteered during the war and fought and died.\" Source: BBC History The West Indian Association of Service Personnel was established to offer support to ex-servicemen and commemorate those who lost their lives in battle. \"If we didn't form that association the public wouldn't know the participation of black West Indians who served the British Empire in their hour of need,\" said Mr Wilmot. In November 2014 a memorial dedicated to African and Caribbean soldiers was unveiled in Brixton, south London, where many ex-servicemen settled after the war. However, the monument has now been placed in storage, until a permanent home for it can be found. Next year Mr King, who now lives in Camberwell, south-east London, will celebrate his 90th birthday. But his determination to remember his comrades shows no sign of fading. \"We just carry on,\" he said. The veterans' stories feature in the BBC Four documentary, Fighting for King and Empire: Britain's Caribbean Heroes, which airs at 21:00 BST on 13 May. It is based on the film, Divided by Race, United in War and Peace, by the-latest.com. Britain's Caribbean Heroes will broadcast on BBC World News on Saturday 6 and Sunday 7 August 2016.

        "article": "England captain Alastair Cook says Australia remain favourites to claim the Ashes despite his side's superb first-Test victory in Cardiff. Media playback is not supported on this device Cook's side carry a 1-0 lead into the second Test at Lord's on Thursday, after last week's 169-run victory. But Cook said: \"Australia are still probably favourites, they've only got to retain, I suppose. \"But series are not played on paper, it's what people deliver. And it's always nice to be underdogs isn't it?\" England, who are taking precautions over the fitness of all-rounder Moeen Ali before the second Test, were hammered 5-0 by Australia in the last Ashes down under in 2013-14. But, following the departure of coach Peter Moores in May, they have undergone an overhaul both on and off the pitch. Under the interim leadership of assistant coach Paul Farbrace, they played positively in the drawn Test series and victorious one-day series against New Zealand. Victory in new head coach Trevor Bayliss's first match in charge gave them the early advantage in the Ashes series. Cook is keen for his side to continue in that positive vein against an Australia side that is likely to feature a number of changes, with wicketkeeper Brad Haddin absent for personal reasons while reports suggest all-rounder Shane Watson will be dropped. \"I think it is important that we don't sit back and protect the lead,\" Cook told BBC Sport. \"We can't do that, certainly not against Australia. \"We have made a big effort with this series not to worry about what Australia do. It is about our attitude and approach. If we can get near the standards of Cardiff we will be a tough team to beat.\" England have won the past two matches between the two at Lord's, following Australia's 75-year unbeaten run at the home of cricket. England's only injury concern is over Moeen, who has felt some soreness in his side following the first Test. Moeen played a key role in the victory in Wales, scoring a brisk 77 at number eight in the first innings and taking five wickets in the match. Cook told BBC Sport: \"He has come through training and fingers crossed he will be fine, which is great news for us. \"He is fine but you always want to be careful and head into an Ashes Test match with people fully fit.\" Uncapped Yorkshire leg-spinner Adil Rashid is on standby should Moeen fail to prove his fitness. In the absence of Haddin, the uncapped Peter Nevill takes over as wicketkeeper. \"I am confident with Nev coming in that we have the wicketkeeper spot covered,\" captain Michael Clarke told BBC Sport. \"He is a fighter and has had a great year back in Australia. \"He deserves his opportunity. He won his spot on form and that is why he is in the squad. I have every confidence he will walk out there and make runs.\" Clarke also expects seam bowler Mitchell Starc to be fit to play, despite suffering an ankle strain that required pain-killing injections in the first Test. Clarke said: \"He took eight wickets. He bowled on one leg in the second innings and still took three wickets. He is a wicket-taker. But all our bowlers need to be more consistent.\" Watson, who was lbw in both innings of the first Test for scores of 30 and 19, is reportedly set to be dropped, with Mitchell Marsh taking his place. However, Clarke said he does not yet know the XI, adding: \"Whoever is picked needs to perform, like the rest of us.\" The 34-year-old added: \"We were outplayed in all facets in the first Test. We have taken the positives and we come here to Lord's and start afresh. \"We have played some really good cricket over the last couple of years and the boys are full of confidence. \"We know how we can play if we are at our best and the boys just need to find that consistently over the five days. We need to bat for long periods, have really good intent with the ball and execution over long periods.\" The pitch at Cardiff was slow, which many felt helped England as it negated the Australian pace attack. Both captains expect a similar surface at Lord's, with Cook saying: \"Normally a Test wicket here is a pretty good wicket. We are in England and I don't think it will be travelling through like Perth.\" Clarke said: \"I think it will be a little bit tacky to start and seam around early so it will be difficult to bat on. But it does look like a pretty good wicket. Generally at Lord's, once the sun comes out, it is a good wicket to bat on.\" Players will also have to contest with the Lord's slope, with batsmen requiring judgement on which balls to play and leave and bowlers requiring greater discipline with their line. Only Mitchell Johnson of the Australia bowling attack has played at Lord's before and his record is poor, conceding 200 runs in 38.4 overs (taking three wickets) in the second Test in 2009. England's James Anderson is the record wicket-taker on the ground with 75 in 17 matches, with Stuart Broad the fourth highest (61 wickets in 14 Tests). Unlike Cardiff, where rain threatened to affect the final day - should the game have gone that far, the forecast for Lord's is good, with BBC Weather stating Thursday will be \"a dry and fine day... with bright or sunny spells developing as cloud breaks and winds staying light\". It is a similar picture across the five days. One of the net bowlers for England in the build-up to this Test is the son of India great Sachin Tendulkar, the leading Test run-scorer in history. Arjun Tendulkar, 15, who is hoping to forge a career in the game, helped put the England batsmen through their paces during practice on Wednesday.",

        "article": "The invasion of Iraq \"substantially\" increased the terrorist threat to the UK, the former head of MI5 has said. Giving evidence to the Iraq inquiry, Baroness Manningham-Buller said the action had radicalised \"a few among a generation\". As a result, she said she was not \"surprised\" that UK nationals were involved in the 7/7 bombings in London. She said she believed the intelligence on Iraq's threat was not \"substantial enough\" to justify the action. Baroness Manningham-Buller said she had advised officials a year before the war that the threat posed by Iraq to the UK was \"very limited\", and she believed that assessment had \"turned out to be the right judgement\". Describing the intelligence on Iraq's weapons threat as \"fragmentary\", she said: \"If you are going to go to war, you need to have a pretty high threshold to decide on that.\" In a previously secret document from 2002, Baroness Manningham-Buller wrote to the Home Office saying: \"We assess that Saddam is only likely to order terrorist attacks if he perceives that the survival of his regime is threatened.\" The Chilcot inquiry is continuing to hear evidence about decisions taken in the build-up to the invasion and its aftermath. Baroness Manningham-Buller, head of the domestic intelligence service between 2002 and 2007, said the terrorist threat to the UK from al-Qaeda and other groups \"pre-dated\" the Iraq invasion and also the 9/11 attacks in the US. However, she said the UK's participation in the March 2003 military action \"undoubtedly increased\" the level of terrorist threat. By Peter BilesBBC correspondent at the inquiry The former head of MI5 chose her words very carefully. Baroness Manningham-Buller was giving her evidence in public, although 35 witnesses have previously testified to the Iraq inquiry behind closed doors in order to protect national security or international relations. Key to her evidence was the release of the declassified assessment which she wrote in March 2002, a year before the invasion of Iraq. This played down the direct threat to the UK from Saddam Hussein's regime, and its possible links to al-Qaeda. As was expected, the focus of her evidence remained on the implications of the 2003 invasion for Britain, rather than the actual decision to go to war. Given the gravity of the situation, with 16 suspected terrorism plots uncovered in the UK between 2001 and 2008, it may be a surprise to some that she did not have direct conversations with Tony Blair during her time as head of MI5. A year after the invasion, she said MI5 was \"swamped\" by leads about terrorist threats to the UK. \"Our involvement in Iraq, for want of a better word, radicalised a whole generation of young people, some of them British citizens who saw our involvement in Iraq, on top of our involvement in Afghanistan, as being an attack on Islam,\" she said, before immediately correcting herself by adding \"not a whole generation, a few among a generation\". The ex-MI5 chief said she shared her concerns that the Iraq invasion would increase the UK's exposure to terrorism with the then home secretary David Blunkett, but did not \"recall\" discussing the matter with Prime Minister Tony Blair. MI5 did not \"foresee the degree to which British citizens would become involved\" in terrorist activity after 2004, she admitted. \"What Iraq did was produce fresh impetus on people prepared to engage in terrorism,\" she said, adding that she could produce evidence to back this up. \"The Iraq war heightened the extremist view that the West was trying to bring down Islam. We gave Bin Laden his jihad.\" Lady Manningham-Buller said MI5 was given a budget increase after 9/11 and again in 2002 but the agency still needed far greater resources as a result of the Iraq invasion. \"By 2003 I found it necessary to ask the prime minister for a doubling of our budget,\" she said. \"This is unheard of, certainly unheard of today, but he and the Treasury and the chancellor accepted that, because I was able to demonstrate the scale of the problem that we were confronted by.\" Baroness Manningham-Buller was part of the government's Joint Intelligence Committee before the war, which drew up the controversial dossier on Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruction in September 2002. The dossier stated the weapons could be activated with 45 minutes of an order to do so. Asked about the dossier, she said she had very limited involvement in its compilation but it was clear, with hindsight, that there was an \"over-reliance\" on certain intelligence. She added: \"We were asked to put in some low-grade, small intelligence into it and we refused because we did not think that it was reliable.\" She said MI5's responsibility was to collect and analyse intelligence and to \"act on it where necessary\" to mitigate terrorist threats, but stressed it was not her job \"to fill in gaps\" in the intelligence. A year before the war, the former MI5 chief advised Home Office officials that the direct threat posed by Iraq to the UK was \"very limited and containable\". In a newly declassified document, published by the inquiry, Baroness Manningham-Buller told the senior civil servant at the Home Office in March 2002 that there was no evidence that Iraq had any involvement in the 9/11 attacks. While there were reports of links between the regime of Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda, there was no intelligence to suggest meaningful co-operation between the two. In that letter, she said the possibility Iraq might use terrorist tactics to defend its own territory in the event of an invasion could not be ruled out. But she stressed Iraqi agents did not have \"much capability\" to carry out UK attacks, adding her view of this never changed. In his evidence in January, Tony Blair described Saddam Hussein as a \"monster\" and said the world was a safer place with him no longer in control of Iraq.",

        "article": "A visitor from another planet listening to the prime minister's speech outside No 10 on Friday could be forgiven for assuming nothing of significance happened the day before. There was no change of tone, no acknowledgement of any fresh message the voters had sent Mrs May, bar a passing reference to opportunity and fairness that echoed her speech on the same spot 11 months ago. It seems odd to me she didn't spend more of the election campaign talking about helping those who are \"just managing\" as she called them in her first (well-received) Downing Street speech. Her defiance extended to an insistence she would stick to the existing timetable for Brexit talks and her ambition produced the phrase \"over the next five years\". Perhaps she was just trying to steady the ship amid calls for her to resign. The Conservatives are notoriously ruthless with leaders who fail and I wouldn't put my mortgage on her still being in place for the conclusion of Brexit talks. Conservative MPs I have spoken to think she has done the right thing for now and that resignation would have increased the uncertainty with all the impact that would have had on financial markets. What does the loss of the Conservative majority mean for Brexit? That is harder to say. There is a growing argument that it means Mrs May will have to compromise more and go for a \"softer\" Brexit. But that ignores the sizeable numbers of Conservative and DUP MPs who favour a \"clean Brexit\" that would mean leaving the single market, the customs union and not paying into the pot after the UK has left. It also relies on the assumption that the remaining 27 EU countries are prepared to offer a choice of Brexit. In one of the most telling interventions of the election campaign, David Cameron suggested that the prime minister needed a large majority to prevent (rather than deliver) an \"extreme Brexit\". \"It's so important,\" he said, \"that the Conservatives win and win well, so Theresa can negotiate that Brexit deal, so she can stand up to people who want an extreme Brexit either here or in Brussels.\" A tiny majority - or no majority at all - would leave Theresa May having to secure a deal that would satisfy the likes of both Sir William Cash and Kenneth Clarke, a tall order in any circumstances. Unless Mrs May takes the advice of the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, Ruth Davidson, who suggests she talks to other political parties to try to secure a cross-party consensus on what she called \"an open Brexit\". Ruth Davidson was one of her party's silver linings, leading the Conservatives to victory in 13 seats. Labour have pointed out that under 'English Votes for English Laws' those Scottish Tory MPs won't be able to take part in some Commons votes on health and education in England.

Now, none of her albums are available on the music-streaming service, after the singer removed her entire back catalogue. So far there's been no word from Swift on why she's taken the tracks down. Spotify meanwhile has released a statement saying that the company hopes \"she'll change her mind\" and return to the site. If you're really desperate for some Taylor Swift - Newsbeat has managed to find two tracks on Spotify that seem to have been left behind. Love Story still features on a compilation called Heart Breakers and The Hunger Games soundtrack has Safe & Sound on it - but there's no guarantee they'll be on there for long. \"We love Taylor Swift, and our more than 40 million users love her even more - nearly 16 million of them have played her songs in the last 30 days, and she's on over 19 million playlists,\" said Spotify. \"We hope she'll change her mind and join us in building a new music economy that works for everyone.\" They added, in reference to one of her hits, Stay Stay Stay: \"PS - Taylor, we were both young when we first saw you, but now there's more than 40 million of us who want you to stay, stay, stay. It's a love story, baby, just say, Yes.\" Representatives for Swift have yet to return a request for comment. The 24-year-old's fifth album, 1989, was released last week and has topped the album charts in the UK. It sold 90,000 copies, making it the fastest-selling album of the year by a female artist, but it was not put on Spotify. Swift has been outspoken in the past about music piracy and in an article in the Wall Street Journal earlier this year, she described how the business models used by some artists have devalued music. \"Piracy, file-sharing and streaming have shrunk the numbers of paid album sales drastically, and every artist has handled this blow differently,\" she said. \"In recent years, you've probably read the articles about major recording artists who have decided to practically give their music away, for this promotion or that exclusive deal. \"My hope for the future, not just in the music industry, but in every young girl I meet\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 is that they all realize their worth and ask for it.\" Spotify claims that its business model, in which revenue is shared with the \"music community\", helps to tackle the issue of piracy. \"We believe fans should be able to listen to music wherever and whenever they want, and that artists have an absolute right to be paid for their work and protected from piracy,\" it said. \"That's why we pay nearly 70% of our revenue back to the music community.\" The site has compiled two playlists in response to her departure, one of which is called What to Play While Taylor's Away. The other - A Little Playlist Poetry for Taylor Swift - features tracks whose titles when read in order say: \"Hey Taylor We Wanted to Play Your Amazing Love Songs And They're Not Here Right Now.\" Follow @BBCNewsbeat on Twitter and Radio1Newsbeat on YouTube",

The absence of millions of young voters from the electoral register could lead to a victory for the Leave camp in the EU referendum, he warned. Mr Miliband said their \"optimistic generation\" can keep Britain in the EU. But Leave campaigner, Conservative MP James Cleverly, said Mr Miliband's \"cynical\" comments would \"fool no-one\". Mr Miliband said in a speech in London on Saturday that 1.5 million of the six million 18-24 year olds eligible to vote are not registered, nor are a quarter of the eight million 25-35 year olds. They have until 7 June to register to vote in the UK's referendum on its membership of the EU, which takes place on 23 June. Mr Miliband said: \"Today is a call to arms to all young people to register to vote. \"Let's be clear about the danger - a decision not to vote is a decision to let someone else decide your future. \"Young people can decide this referendum. If they don't use their vote, the danger is this referendum will be lost.\" The UK's EU vote: All you need to know EU referendum issues guide: Explore the arguments Mr Miliband, who resigned as leader of the Labour Party following its defeat in the 2015 general election, said the Leave side offered a \"narrow\" future which pretended to be about national freedom. He added: \"When the Leave campaign is asked about the future - future jobs, future opportunities, future growth - they have one answer: they just don't know. \"Those words should ring in the ears of every child, student and parent. Not knowing is not a path to prosperity, not knowing is the road to recession.\" Mr Miliband also told BBC Breakfast that polls suggested younger people were more likely to vote to remain in the EU by three to one, and that older people should \"heed the wisdom of the young\". He added: \"All round the world young people are kicking against the establishment, and yet young people want to back Remain. \"That shows Remain is a future-orientated, positive, optimistic idea, because I think young people take for granted that we've got to work with other countries, and not isolate ourselves.\" Mr Cleverly said Mr Miliband's \"cynical\" attempt to reach young people \"will fool no-one\". \"After his failed efforts to court the youth vote via Russell Brand last year, you'd think he would know better.\" He also told the BBC that he \"absolutely\" wanted young people to vote in the referendum. \"When I talk to young people, actually I find that they are very concerned about the costs of EU membership, about how it limits our ability to trade with the developing world, and how it impinges on our democracy.\" Meanwhile, pro-Brexit employment minister Priti Patel launched an attack on the economic predictions of her government colleagues in the Treasury. While out campaigning she told the BBC its forecasts have \"been questioned heavily\" and that Vote Leave was \"making the positive economic case as to why we should leave the European Union\". \"Of course we can take back control of the money we send to Europe and spend that growing our economic base and invest that in our economic prosperity in future,\" she said. And despite their increasingly personalised battle, David Cameron indicated he still regards Leave campaigner Boris Johnson as a \"substantial\" potential future successor.

The think tank's UK growth forecast for 2016 has been cut from 2.3% to 1.9%, and from 2.6% to just 0.4% for 2017. Meanwhile its forecast for GDP growth for 2018 was slashed from 2.4% to 1.4%. Its report said the Brexit vote would have \"severe confidence effects on spending and business investment\", which would lead to anaemic GDP growth over the next three years. However, the drop in the value of the pound could bolster exports by 3.4% next year, the Item Club said, with imports falling by 0.3%. Overall, the move would see net exports adding 1.1% to GDP in 2017, it added. Brexit 'will be horrible for UK economy' - fund manager Peter Spencer, chief economic advisor to the EY Item Club, said the UK economy was set to suffer a severe loss of momentum in the second half of this year. \"Heightened uncertainty is likely to hold back business investment, while consumer spending will be restrained by a weaker jobs market and higher inflation,\" he said. \"Longer-term, the UK may have to adjust to a permanent reduction in the size of the economy, compared to the trend that seemed possible prior to the vote. But amongst the gloom, the weaker pound provides one silver lining to exporters, particularly those selling to the US and emerging markets.\" A new survey from Deloitte found 82% of chief financial officers of both FTSE 350 and large privately owned companies expected to cut capital spending in the next year. That was the biggest proportion on record and more than double the 34% in the first quarter, Deloitte said. Its survey was conducted between 28 June 28 and 11 July, after the EU referendum and just before Theresa May became the new prime minister. Almost all the CFOs surveyed said the level of uncertainty facing their businesses was higher than normal. Ian Stewart, Deloitte's chief economist, said: \"Perceptions of uncertainty have soared to levels last associated with the euro crisis five years ago.\" Leading City fund manager Richard Buxton, chief executive of Old Mutual Global Investors, has said the Brexit vote would have a \"horrible\" impact on the UK economy, which could \"judder to a halt\". The Item Club's Mr Spencer said that there were some positives ahead, including the UK retaining full access to the EU's single market in the short-term. As well as the fall in the exchange rate offering export opportunities, he said the predicted increases in inflation and unemployment would allow the economy to rebalance away from consumption. The Item Club also predicted that unemployment would rise from 5% to 7.1% by late 2019.",

The Labour leader has warned the terms of reference, which have yet to be published, could be too \"narrow\" and residents not properly consulted. He wants an interim report on the cause of the fire by September, followed by a wider probe into building regulations, council funding and other issues. The presumed death toll stands at 80. Police have warned the final figure will not be known until at least the end of the year. The leader of Kensington and Chelsea Council, Nick Paget-Brown, which was criticised for its response to the disaster on 14 June, quit on Friday. Retired former Court of Appeal judge Sir Martin Moore-Bick was appointed to head the inquiry on Wednesday. It will sit in public and have the powers to compel witnesses and obtain evidence. Visiting the scene of the blaze on Thursday, Sir Martin said he believed the probe and its recommendations would be \"pretty well limited\" to what had caused the fire and its rapid spread. Setting out his ambition to produce a report within a year, he said he was aware that people in the area want a broader investigation but he was not sure that his inquiry would be the right setting. The prime minister has said she expects an interim report to be made available as soon as possible and that survivors and residents should be consulted on the terms of reference. But Mr Corbyn said he wanted a guarantee the initial findings would be published by the end of the summer. In a letter to Mrs May, he said the inquiry would be best served by being split into two parts to ensure \"timeliness would not have to be sacrificed for rigour\". While understanding how the fire started was of the \"utmost importance\", he said survivors and other residents had a multitude of other questions about how their safety had come to be compromised and what could have been done to prevent the disaster. \"Whilst the detail of the specific failures at Grenfell needs to be uncovered, it is also clear that the Grenfell fire has much wider implications for national policy issues,\" he said. The issues that must be addressed, he said, included: \"An inquiry within narrow terms of reference risks failing to learn all the lessons of this tragedy.\" The PM has said the immediate priority is to establish the facts of what happened at Grenfell Tower and to take the necessary action to prevent a similar tragedy from happening again. But she has said the \"wider lessons\" must be learn from both this catastrophe, and the inspections of other buildings around the country that followed it.",

Figures for England, Wales and Northern Ireland showed more than a quarter of cases were not picked up within the required 24 hours after birth. Health campaigners say the problem can affect crucial early days of bonding. A cleft palate is a gap in the roof of the mouth leading to difficulties sucking adequately and trouble feeding. The condition can also lead to hearing and speech difficulties, and may indicate other problems with the heart or nervous system. Unlike a cleft lip, a cleft in the palate is hard to identify in a scan during pregnancy. National guidelines say the problem, which affects about 500 babies every year in the UK, should be diagnosed within 24 hours of birth. This allows quick referral to a team of experts including surgeons, nurses, orthodontists and speech and language therapists. But figures published by the Royal College of Surgeons show a cleft palate is often missed at birth. They come from the Crane Database, which is a national register of information on those born with a cleft lip or palate in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The Crane annual report says last year 28% of babies with a cleft palate alone did not get a diagnosis within 24 hours. And 5% of cases had not been picked up after a month. The clinical lead of the database, Scott Deacon, says there is a need for stronger guidelines. He says in the past health staff have been trained to use a finger to feel for the defect, but he insists that a thorough visual check is needed. \"What we're asking for is for people to visibly examine the mouth using a torch and a spatula to get the tongue out of the way. Because obviously a baby is small and it's not the easiest thing to see unless you're getting the tongue depressed and out of the way.\" When Tomas Lewis struggled to feed, his mother Elizabeth was told he might have just been sleepy as a result of her epidural during labour. It was only four days later, back at home, Tomas's uncle spotted a hole in his mouth as he yawned. The family did an internet search and made their own diagnosis of a cleft palate - which was confirmed by a health professional the following day. Mrs Lewis says those first few days, when Tomas was losing weight, were \"horrendous\". But they were then supported by a specialist team, and when he was seven months old Tomas had corrective surgery. His mother says from that moment he was \"a different little boy\". Mr Deacon says a failure to diagnose the problem can cause parents great anxiety and distress. That was the experience of Elizabeth Lewis 16 months ago following the birth of her son Tomas. He struggled to feed and lost weight, but it took four days until his cleft palate was identified. \"I just wasn't able to feed him and give him that important nourishment that he needed. And that is very hard. You start blaming yourself, thinking I must be doing something wrong, there's something wrong with my child. \"It's awful and I wouldn't wish it on anybody,\" she said. Tomas has had corrective surgery on the cleft, but will require further checks on his speech and hearing. Rosanna Preston from the Cleft Lip and Palate Association backed the call for better early diagnosis: \"For any parent, noticing that your baby is not eating, feeding properly or gaining weight is terribly worrying. \"Many parents will initially blame themselves until the cause is found and worries about their baby's health can affect those crucial early days of bonding; the sooner they can get support the better.\" A spokesman for the Department of Health said newborn babies deserved nothing less than the best possible care. \"We expect that NHS organisations will want to follow NICE [National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence] guidelines on postnatal care, so that mothers and new babies receive the vital support they need.\"",

UKIP is looking for a new leader following the shock resignation of Diane James, who had succeeded Nigel Farage after the EU referendum. MEP Steven Woolfe, who had been seen as the frontrunner, quit the party on Monday. He had been hospitalised after a \"scuffle\" with fellow MEP Mike Hookem. Speaking to the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme, Mr Coburn denied Mr Woolfe's claim that UKIP was in a \"death spiral\" and had become ungovernable. He said the incident between Mr Woolfe and Mr Hookem had been \"regrettable\" but had involved only two people rather than the whole party. Mr Woolfe has stood by his claim that he \"received a blow\" from Mr Hookem, though this has been denied by Mr Hookem. Mr Coburn said: \"I keep saying it is country, party and self last. It is ideas that count, not individuals. What we are looking for is an agenda for the future, we are publishing it now and that is how we are moving forward. \"Can I lead the party? Well, if I were asked by colleagues then of course I would do my best. But the thing is it is not about who is governing, it is to do with getting a group of people together, a collegiate group of people, who are going to run the thing.\" Mr Coburn said the party's libertarian politics meant people \"can't be told what to do\" but called on party members to \"govern their own emotions and govern their own behaviour\". He added: \"What has happened is that we have had a charismatic leader for many years, who has kept a lid on things. \"Now what you have got is you've got to choose a new leader. In that, you've lifted the lid off things a bit and it bubbles over.\" Mr Coburn, who is UKIP's only elected representative in Scotland, insisted there was still a reason for the party to exist despite achieving its core aim of having the UK leave the EU. He said he wanted to ensure the country was run \"in the interests of the people not in the interests of big business or trade unions\" and that he had joined UKIP because he wanted \"radical change\" to the way the country was governed, not just because he wanted to leave the EU. And he said he would \"certainly not\" be supporting First Minister Nicola Sturgeon's attempts to keep Scotland in the EU single market after Brexit. Mr Coburn insisted: \"We decided during the Scottish referendum on independence that we are part of the United Kingdom and in terms of that we voted in the European referendum, that was as a United Kingdom. \"We entered as a United Kingdom, we leave as a United Kingdom.

Mr Abe will be accompanied by US President Barack Obama, making the visit the first by the leaders of both countries since the attack. Mr Abe will pray for the dead but will not issue an apology, his aides said. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour killed 2,300 US servicemen and propelled the US into World War Two. After landing, the Japanese prime minister first headed to National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, and laid down a wreath. He stood for a moment of silence at the cemetery near downtown Honolulu, a memorial to those who died. All eight battleships at the base were damaged and four were sunk. But the key US aircraft carriers were at sea at the time. On Tuesday, Mr Abe and Mr Obama will pray for the dead at the site of the attack before holding a summit meeting in Hawaii, their last before Mr Obama steps down in January. Mr Abe's visit, three weeks after the 75th anniversary of the attack, follows a visit earlier this year to Hiroshima by Mr Obama. He became the first serving US president to visit the Japanese city, where about 150,000 people are believed to have been killed in 1945 by a US atomic bomb. 353 Japanese aircraft attacked the US Naval Base in Hawaii at 07:55 2,403 US personnel were killed in the attack 19 US Navy ships, including 8 battleships, were damaged or destroyed 328 US aircraft were damaged or destroyed in the attack, which lasted for one hour and 15 minutes The first Japanese leader to visit Pearl Harbor was Shigeru Yoshida who in 1951 stopped over in Hawaii both on the way to and from the signing of the peace treaty with the US in San Francisco. His visit on the way home included a meeting with the commander of the US Pacific fleet, Admiral Arthur Radford. The office where the two men met offered a direct view of the site of the Japanese attack. \"I could almost see the wreck of Arizona\" out of the window, Mr Radford later wrote in his memoir, referring to a battleship that sank in the attack.

The memory of the \"Boy from Bassendean\" - a suburb in the Western Australian state capital - is being erased by the local council. He has gone from favourite son to outcast by a simple show of hands at a council meeting. Harris's artworks will be taken down from its chambers and his status as a freeman has been rescinded, while a plaque outside his childhood home was stolen before the local authority could remove it. \"We simply cannot tolerate the horrendous crimes for which he's been convicted,\" Bassendean Mayor John Gangell told ABC radio. And the backlash is spreading. In Melbourne a public mural, the \"Entertainers of the Century\" that features 100 prominent performers, will be changed to paint over Rolf Harris's cheery image. There is speculation, too, that Harris could be stripped of his Order of Australia award, one of the nation's most coveted honours. His conviction comes at a sensitive time for Australia, where the depravity of paedophiles is being scrutinised like never before. A royal commission into institutional responses to child sex abuse continues to uncover a terrible flood of atrocities, and could take years to complete its task. Justice Peter McClellan, who chairs it, believes that victims who have suffered alone for so long are finally coming forward because of high-profile court cases, including the conviction of Harris. \"It is becoming apparent as we do our work that as the issue of abuse is raised and talked about, survivors increasingly feel able to bring their own story to the authorities,\" said Justice McClellan. \"That which may have been kept secret for years may now be told. The burden of guilt and shame which many have felt is lifted by knowing that others who have suffered have overcome their reticence,\" he added. The law firm Slater & Gordon says since Harris's trial began it has been contacted by around a dozen women in Australia and New Zealand alleging they were molested by the TV presenter. \"My understanding is that we're talking about assaults that occurred in those countries going back to the 70s and 80s,\" said lawyer Alan Collins. \"Given what we heard in [Southwark Crown] court, a number of victims have suffered a very profound damage, I would have thought it highly likely that claims would be brought.\" Hetty Johnston, founder of one of Australia's most prominent child safety groups, Bravehearts Inc, raised the prospect of further charges against Harris. \"Rolf Harris - icon to inmate. Victims vindicated. Hopefully when he comes out there will be more victims waiting to send him right back,\" Ms Johnston tweeted. Convicted by a court half a world away, 84-year old Harris has felt the full force of media outrage back home. The Australian has detailed \"his most spectacular fall from cuddly establishment showman to jailbird,\" while the Sydney Morning Herald said he was \"always an embarrassing curiosity rather than a national treasure\".

        "article": "So Ukraine confounded the bookmakers and Eurovision commentators who had been convinced that Russia - or possibly Australia - would win. Russia's CG effects and the brilliance of Australia's singing were not enough to defeat jazz artist Jamala. Russia's Sergey Lazarev had been the bookies' top tip for days, possibly because his song was so similar to 2015's Swedish winner - with innovative staging and a slick song to match. But Ukraine stole past Russia and Australia under the radar, with the new voting system providing a huge surprise at the 11th hour when Jamala was crowned as winner. She is the first Crimean Tatar to perform at the contest, and her song, 1944, could not have been further from Eurovision's usual fare. It deals with Stalin, Crimea and claims of ethnic cleansing. Jamala dedicated it to her great-grandmother and her five children, who were deported by Soviet troops from Crimea in 1944. Simon Bennett, head of the International OGAE Eurovision fan club, told the BBC that former Soviet countries that would \"normally vote for Russia\" had sent it a message by voting for Ukraine instead. Political songs are not allowed at Eurovision, but 1944 was permitted because it was based on historic fact, rather than current politics. BBC Music reporter Mark Savage wrote in February that Ukraine's 2004 Eurovision winner, Ruslana, had said the song 1944 had struck a chord over current circumstances in the region. \"This song... is precisely what we are all suffering in Ukraine today,\" she said, referencing Russia's seizure of Crimea in 2014. Jamala simply said after her win: \"I want peace and love for everyone,\" adding at the press conference: \"I was sure that if you talk about truth it really can touch people.\" But John Kennedy O'Connor, broadcaster, author and Eurovision expert, was not happy with Saturday's result. \"I'm disappointed that a dirge about genocide and delivering a pointed slap in Russia's face has won this year,\" he told the BBC. \"This contest should never be a political platform and I'm almost angry that it's been turned into one, despite the very clear rule book on the matter.\" He said that while third place was an \"excellent result\", the Russians must be \"sick as parrots\" at the moment. Alasdair Rendall, president of the Eurovision fan club OGAE UK, said immediate reaction to Jamala's victory was \"mixed\". \"Many people admired her strong voice and the impressive visuals on show,\" he told the BBC. \"However many are already saying it won due to the strong political message it carried rather than its musical quality.\" As for Australia, Bennett said it was \"neutral and easy to give your votes to\" while O'Connor said it was \"time for them to go away and start AsiaVision now\", referring to a song contest for Asia Pacific countries. And at the other end of the leaderboard, hopes for the UK's Joe and Jake were dashed when they came third from bottom. Rendall felt the result was \"totally undeserved\" and Bennett was \"distraught for them\". But O'Connor added: \"The fact that their single is not in the UK top 100 after a month [plus] since its release says it all really.\" Joe and Jake told the BBC they had given \"it their all\" and sent \"huge congratulations\" to Jamala. The new voting system also got a mixed reception, with Bennett saying it was \"a disaster that destroyed the atmosphere\"' while Rendall said it had \"really ramped up the tension\". It seems that the only thing everyone agreed on was the show itself. \"Congratulations to Swedish TV for putting on one of the most impressive, exciting and high quality Eurovisions ever,\" said Rendall.",

        "article": "A \"complete lack of common sense\" in the Department for Transport's handling of the West Coast Main Line franchise deal will cost taxpayers \"\u00a350m at the very least\", MPs have said. The cost might be \"very much larger\", the Public Accounts Committee warned. The committee accused the department of making \"fundamental errors\" and failing to learn from \"previous disasters\". A spokesman said the department had taken steps to ensure there could be no repeat of the failure. But Labour accused ministers of \"hiding behind their civil servants\". Explaining why the total cost might prove to be higher than previous estimates, Labour MP Margaret Hodge, who chairs the committee, said: \"If you factor in the cost of delays to investment on the line, and the potential knock-on effect on other franchise competitions, then the final cost to the taxpayer will be very much larger.\" Unveiling her committee's latest report, Mrs Hodge said: \"The franchising process was littered with basic errors. The department yet again failed to learn from previous disasters, like the Metronet contract. It failed to heed advice from its lawyers. It failed to respond appropriately to early warning signs that things were going wrong. \"Senior management did not have proper oversight of the project. Cuts in staffing and in consultancy budgets contributed to a lack of key skills. \"The project suffered from a lack of leadership. There was no single person responsible from beginning to end and, therefore, no one who had to live with the consequences of bad policy decisions. \"For three months, there was no single person in charge at all. Not only that, there was no senior civil servant in the team responsible for the work, despite the critical importance of this multi-billion pound franchise.\" The committee had been \"astonished\" that the Department for Transport's top civil servant had been \"told he could not see all the information which might have enabled him to challenge the processes, although it was one of the most important tasks for which the department is responsible\". Mrs Hodge added: \"Given that the department got it so wrong over this competition, we must feel concern over how properly it will handle future projects, including HS2 and Thameslink [rail routes].\" \"The department needs to get its house in order and put basic principles and practices at the heart of what it does, with an appropriately qualified and senior person in charge of the project throughout and an accessible leadership team ready and willing to hear and act on warning signs.\" In October, the government scrapped its decision to award the \u00a35bn franchise to FirstGroup. The mistakes in the West Coast process came to light after rival bidder Virgin Trains launched a legal challenge against the decision. Virgin will continue running the service until November 2014, when a new long-term franchise will begin. In December, the National Audit Office calculated that there would be a \"significant cost to the taxpayer\" as a result of the fiasco. It said costs for staff, advisers, lawyers and the two reviews into the fiasco added up to \u00a38.9m, on top of the estimated \u00a340m it will take to reimburse firms for the cost of their bids. Bob Crow, the leader of the RMT union, which represents rail workers, called for wholesale renationalisation of the railways. \"The stench from the fall-out of the West Coast franchise continues to hang over Britain's transport industry as it becomes clearer with every examination that the ministers responsible for this shambles could not be trusted to run a whelk stall let alone multi-billion government contracts,\" he said. \"Privatisation is a corrosive and expensive political project doomed to repeated and costly failure, twice on the East Coast and now on the West,\" he added. \"Fiddling with processes won't work. It's the whole, rotten policy that needs dumping with a return to public ownership.\" But a Department for Transport spokesman said: \"The independent Laidlaw inquiry published in December identified the unique and exceptional circumstances which led to failures in the West Coast franchising programme and crucially what steps the department should take to prevent this from happening again. \"The department has accepted all the recommendations and has taken immediate steps by bringing together all rail activity under a single director general and recruiting a senior director to lead the franchising programme, as well as improving internal governance and strengthening oversight and accountability. \"Not only will these reinforce the franchising process but will also protect rail infrastructure projects such as HS2 and the biggest programme of rail electrification.\" Maria Eagle, the shadow transport secretary, called on Prime Minister David Cameron to \"take responsibility for the rail franchising fiasco, instead of allowing ministers to hide behind their civil servants\". \"The government must accept the finding of the Public Accounts Committee that it was the short-sighted decision by ministers to axe external audits of multi-billion pound contracts that ended up with at least \u00a350m of taxpayers' money going down the drain,\" she added. \"It is a disgrace that every politician responsible for the bungled franchise deal has either remained in the cabinet or been promoted to it.\" Richard Hebditch of Campaign for Better Transport, which fights for better public transport, said the report showed the biggest problem was the franchising system itself. \"Franchising needs to be completely reformed so that what counts are improvements to the service on offer, rather than complex calculations of profit and loss that don't stack up,\" he said.",

        "article": "The scandal surrounding Malaysia's state development fund 1MDB has gripped the country for years. Now the US has said it is moving to seize more than $1bn (\u00a3761m) in assets, ranging from plush properties to a private jet, from people connected to the country's Prime Minister Najib Razak. The asset seizure by the US would be the largest ever by the Justice Department's anti-corruption unit. This is how the story has played out so far. 1Malaysia Development Bhd, set up by Mr Najib in 2009, was meant to turn Kuala Lumpur into a financial hub and boost the economy through strategic investments. But it started to attract negative attention in early 2015 after it missed payments for some of the $11bn it owed to banks and bondholders. Then the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported it had seen a paper trail that allegedly traced close to $700m from the fund to Mr Najib's personal bank accounts. Why is the US intervening now? The Department of Justice alleges $3.5bn (\u00a32.6bn) was misappropriated from 1MDB. \"The Malaysian people were defrauded on an enormous scale,\" Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe said at a news conference. Mr Najib is not named in the suit. But it refers to \"Malaysian Official 1\", described as \"a high-ranking official in the Malaysian government who also held a position of authority with 1MDB\".\u200b The move reflects an intention by the US to open new fronts in its fight against illicit finance. It also sets up a rare confrontations between the US and Malaysia, which is considered an important partner in the fight against terrorism. What do people involved say? 1MDB responded to the US papers by saying it had not benefited from the various transactions described in the suit. The fund has repeatedly asserted that it has never given money to the prime minister and called the claims \"unsubstantiated\". Mr Najib has also consistently denied taking money from 1MDB or any public funds. His office said Malaysia had \"led the way in investigations into 1MDB\" and would \"fully co-operate with any lawful investigation\". Is anyone else involved? Mr Najib has accused his fiercest critic, former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, of using the scandal as a means of \"political sabotage\". He claims Mr Mahathir worked \"hand in glove\" with foreigners as part of a campaign \"to topple a democratically elected prime minister.\" The BBC put Mr Najib's allegations to Mr Mahathir, who dismissed the claims. Instead, he called on the prime minister to show proof that he didn't pocket state funds. Over the last year, Mr Najib has also sacked his deputy Muhyiddin Yassin and replaced the former attorney-general over critical comments they made about the scandal. There have been multiple domestic official investigations into the 1MDB fund, including a special task force headed by the attorney general. The team raided the office of 1MDB in 2015 and took away some documents. But the replacement attorney general cleared Mr Najib of wrongdoing in January. Multiple foreign authorities have also been investigating the company. In May, Singapore ordered Swiss bank BSI to shut down in the city-state for breaking its money-laundering laws in its dealings with 1MDB. Swiss authorities have opened criminal proceedings related to 1MDB on \"suspected corruption of public foreign officials, dishonest management of public interests and money laundering\". Former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said Malaysians should push for a referendum on the prime minister's leadership. Opposition leader in parliament, Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, called upon Mr Najib to give a full explanation in parliament and go on leave so a full probe could take place. Civil society group Bersih said Mr Najib and the attorney-general who in January had cleared the prime minister should both resign immediately to make way for independent investigations. The 1MDB controversy has frustrated many Malaysians who are struggling with the rising cost of living and what is perceived to be ingrained corruption in its political system. Last year tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets calling for the resignation of the PM. However, thousands have also rallied in support of the government. The reaction on Thursday to the US move was muted in both Malaysia's mainstream newspapers and social media. Malaysia's government has cracked down on reporting of the 1MDB scandal, blocking access to certain online news portals and targeting media groups and journalists.",

An emotional Canadian Trade Minister Chrystia Freeland left the talks in Brussels, saying the EU was \"not capable\" of signing a trade agreement. Belgium, the only country blocking accord, needed consent from the regional parliament of Wallonia. The wide-ranging deal, seven years in the making, was to be signed next week. Speaking outside the seat of the Walloon government, Ms Freeland told reporters:  \"It seems evident for me and for Canada that the European Union is not now capable of having an international accord even with a country that has values as European as Canada.\" She added: \"Canada is disappointed, but I think it is impossible.\" It was unclear whether the EU would keep negotiating with Wallonia in coming days to solve the impasse. European Parliament briefing on Ceta The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, or Ceta, was expected to boost bilateral trade, but Wallonia sees the accord as a threat to farmers and welfare standards. The region has a strong socialist tradition. Its fears echo those of anti-globalisation activists, who say Ceta and deals like it give too much power to multinationals - power even to intimidate governments. There have also been big demonstrations in several EU countries against Ceta and the TTIP trade talks with the US. The Canada-EU trade deal was seven years in the making but it took far less time to unravel. Canada has been scrambling to keep Ceta together after the Walloon regional assembly in Belgium voted last week to reject it. The deal was completed under Canada's former Conservative government but is a major priority for the Liberals, who are under pressure to boost the country's economy. They dispatched special envoy Pierre Pettigrew, a former cabinet minister with a wealth of experience on the international trade file, to help save the flagging agreement. Federal trade minister Chrystia Freeland has met repeatedly over the past months with European leaders to shepherd it through, but with no luck. The failure to clinch the EU-Canada Ceta deal is an embarrassment for the EU. Wallonia, a region of just 3.6 million people, has all but scuppered a trade deal affecting 508 million Europeans and 36.3 million Canadians. The European Commission says this blow does not mean that Ceta is over, but it also refuses to unpick the massive text that was agreed with Canada in 2014. Any EU free trade deals with the US, China or India now look remote. Anti-globalisation groups, anxious to protect Europe's welfare and environmental standards, may feel they are winning the argument. For now, any Ceta boost for small businesses and jobs has been postponed. The failure gives us a sense of how tough the Brexit talks will be, despite the UK's current alignment with its EU partners. One very obvious lesson from this impasse is that it is going to be difficult for the European Union to implement trade and investment deals, perhaps with anyone. For the UK post-Brexit it suggests two contrasting implications. Negotiating a trade agreement that gives British exporters barrier free access to the EU's single market could be a huge challenge. For sure, there will be some important differences. For the EU, Britain is a more important export market than Canada, so some EU states will have a good deal to lose from failing to agree. But securing the agreement of all of them is unlikely to be straightforward. On the other hand, negotiating an agreement with other countries outside the EU should become easier. To put it bluntly, the British government won't need to care what the Walloon parliament, for example, thinks.",

The Age UK review said some people could not even wash, dress or feed themselves and yet were being left to fend for themselves by councils. And the charity warned that the whole system was close to collapse in some areas with services closing. It comes after the government said it was looking to solve the problems. Last week, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt pledged action on social care, which covers care homes and help in the home. That has prompted a growing expectation that a rescue package will be announced in the Budget in early March. Care is funded by either councils or individuals themselves - although growing numbers are also relying on family and friends to support them. The Age UK review looked at existing data and concluded there were nearly 1.2 million people who were not now getting the care they need - a rise of 48% since 2010. This included: The charity said this had been caused by cuts to council budgets which had led to a rationing of services. Last year, fewer than half of the people who requested help from councils were given it. You stay in your own home while getting help with everyday tasks such as washing, dressing and eating. average amount of care provided per week, by your council average paid per hour by your council, 2014-15 average paid per hour in your region if you pay for your own care, 2016 You live in a care home that provides round-the-clock support with everyday tasks.

TBC pay for their own care Savings, investments and income are assessed, along with the value of your home - unless you or a close relative live there. As well as reducing the numbers of people they help, councils have also started to squeeze the fees they pay agencies that run care homes and home help services. A report by market analysts Laing Buission earlier this year that estimated councils were paying \u00a3100 less a week than the going rate for a care home place. The Age UK review said half of councils had seen a care home provider cease trading in their area, while a third had seen a home care agency fold. Age UK director Caroline Abrahams said: \"Our new report makes for frightening reading because it shows just how fragile older people's social care now is. \"We think there is a real risk of collapse in social care in the worst affected areas.\" Izzi Seccombe, from the Local Government Association, which represents councils, said the review was \"deeply disturbing\". \"Genuine new government money is now the only way to protect the services.\" Councils spent \u00a316bn last year on services for elderly and disabled people. It comes after funding from central government was cut by a third in real terms during the last Parliament. Councils protected social care by making big cuts elsewhere but still had to reduce the amount they spent on social care by 6%. Ministers have given councils the ability to ring-fence council tax increases for care services in the coming years and have used NHS money to invest in services, but the LGA predicts by 2020 there will still be a \u00a32.6bn shortfall. In an interview with the BBC last week, Mr Hunt pledged the government would address the pressures in the social care system. A Department of Health spokeswoman said it was not all about money, but added ministers were \"working to find a long-term, sustainable solution\". Read more from Nick Follow Nick on Twitter",

The Seagulls remain one point ahead of second-placed Newcastle. Tommy Smith's angled shot put the hosts in front before Tomer Hemed rounded the goalkeeper to equalise. Nahki Wells fired into the top corner and Elias Kachunga nodded in to make it 3-1 before half-time, and Lewis Dunk's red card added to Brighton's misery. Centre-back Dunk was sent off for a second yellow card midway through the second half for a lunging challenge on Izzy Brown, having been booked in the first period for a foul on the same player. The Terriers' seventh win in nine league matches keeps them fifth, but they are now just two points behind fourth-placed Leeds, who they play at home on Sunday. Brighton, knocked out of the FA Cup by non-league Lincoln five days earlier, were uncharacteristically poor in defence and conceded three goals in a league match for the first time in almost 12 months. The outstanding Rajiv van La Parra had already hit the post before full-back Smith's attempted cross landed back at his feet, and his subsequent shot flew in at the near post. Hemed pounced on a poor back header from Huddersfield's Aaron Mooy to level, but that proved to be the only clear chance they created in the entire 90 minutes. Wells' excellent finish from just inside the box was his 100th goal in English football, and it was the former Bradford forward's shot which goalkeeper David Stockdale palmed into the air for Kachunga to head in Huddersfield's third from close range. After Dunk's dismissal, the fifth of his career, there was still time for Australian midfielder Mooy to strike the upright from long range and Stockdale to tip over a powerful attempt from substitute Kasey Palmer. Huddersfield head coach David Wagner told BBC Radio Leeds: \"It was a good one, maybe one of the best this season. We scored three goals and had chances for more, and conceded a sloppy goal which was easy to avoid, but it was very good. \"We are fresh and still very hungry and greedy, even when we are humble and we know we're playing against the best team in the division. \"We gave ourselves no limits, we try our best and today our best was very good.\" Brighton manager Chris Hughton told BBC Sussex: \"Every now and again you get a real bad one, and that was a real bad one. \"We were nowhere near the levels you need to play any game in this division, never mind one as good as Huddersfield, and on their own ground too. \"If we put in another performance like this at Brentford on Sunday, we will lose again.

Thirty-two people died when the cruise ship hit rocks off the Tuscan island of Giglio in January 2012 and tipped on to its side. Capt Schettino was also convicted of causing the shipwreck and abandoning ship before his passengers, earning him the title \"Captain Coward\" in the Italian media.

In 2006, he was promoted from second-in-command to captain. Costa Concordia: What happened Eyewitness accounts Salvaging the Costa Concordia Capt Schettino was singled out for blame by the official report into the sinking of the Costa Concordia, almost a floating city with its 4,300 passengers and crew members. It alleged he deliberately changed course to perform a risky night-time sail-past salute to people on the tiny island of Giglio. He told his trial he \"wanted to kill three birds with one stone\": to please the passengers, salute a retired captain on Giglio and do a favour to the vessel's head waiter, who was from the island. He has rejected rumours that he had wanted to impress his lover, Domnica Cemortan, with him at the helm. As details of the unplanned change of course emerged, ship owner Costa Cruises distanced itself from the captain who, it said, had made \"serious errors of judgement\" and carried out a manoeuvre \"unauthorised, unapproved and unknown to Costa\". The captain told the court that he had been been sacrificed to safeguard \"economic interests\", arguing that the court should be considering an entire organisation rather than one man. In a TV interview given hours after the ship ran aground, Mr Schettino's shock and disbelief was clear as he told reporters the rocks had not been shown on his charts. \"We were about 300 metres from the rocks, more or less, we shouldn't have hit anything.\" Widely vilified in Italy for leaving his ship while passengers were still on board, Capt Schettino's reputation was further damaged when transcripts suggested he had not told the coastguard initially of the gravity of the damage to the ship. \"Listen Schettino, perhaps you have saved yourself from the sea, but I will make you look very bad. I will make you pay for this. Dammit, go back on board!\" says Coastguard Capt Gregorio De Falco, repeatedly ordering him to return to the ship. Speaking by radio from a lifeboat, Capt Schettino said he was co-ordinating the rescue from there, pleading at one point: \"Do you realise that it is dark and we can't see anything?\" The coastguard shouts back: \"So, what do you want to do, to go home, Schettino?! It's dark and you want to go home? Go to the bow of the ship where the ladder is and tell me what needs to be done, how many people there are, and what they need! Now!\" A taxi driver who says he took the captain to a hotel the morning after the sinking said the captain had asked only where he could buy some socks. \"He looked like a beaten dog, cold and scared,\" the taxi driver said. Capt Schettino has accepted some degree of responsibility, asking for forgiveness in a television interview in 2012 as he talked of those who died. He said he blamed himself for being \"distracted\" but said that he had not been on the bridge when the ship ran aground. In the interview, he broke down when asked about the youngest of the 32 victims, a five-year-old girl. As the accusations against Capt Schettino grew, there were those who came to his defence, including sailors, who agreed with his assertion that his decision to steer the ship towards shallower waters had probably saved dozens of lives. His defence lawyers accused the prosecution of focusing on him while offering plea bargains to five co-defendants, jailed in July 2013 for up to two years and 10 months. According to an interview in Naples-based Il Mattino newspaper quoting his sister, the first person Capt Schettino called after the incident was his 80-year-old mother, Rosa. \"He called her at five in the morning on Saturday to tell her there had been a disaster, that he had tried to save as many passengers as possible and not to worry, because it was all over,\" she said. As he asked for a 26-year sentence, prosecutor Stefano Pizza listed all the mistakes Capt Schettino had made and said: \"May God have pity on Schettino, because we cannot.\"",

        "article": "Jim Broadbent has returned to the stage for the first time in a decade to play Scrooge in a new West End version of Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol. The classic adaptation, which opened on Wednesday, is presented on a set designed like a Victorian toy theatre. Broadbent plays his role with an undercurrent of his well-known affability, according to the critics. Yet he said his Scrooge had been partly inspired by modern bankers and the issue of pay-day loans. \"There are an awful lot of echoes of what's going on today. We don't mention pay day loans but it's implied,\" he said. \"It's not a faithful view of Victorian London. It's a subtle piece of writing that allows all sorts of elements in to make it more relevant. \"At the beginning of the play Scrooge presents himself as someone who's rather smooth and into marketing. He presents a benevolent front to the world so he can carry out his financial activities. \" The play is written by Patrick Barlow, with whom Broadbent performed for many years in the cult comedy troupe The National Theatre of Brent. And the small cast - including actors Adeel Akhtar, Amelia Bullmore, Keir Charles and Samantha Spiro - play multiples roles alongside some ingenious and heart-rending puppetry. Playwright Barlow said it had been a joy to bring Broadbent back to the stage. \"It was the clown in him that I first worked with and the clown in him that I wanted to work with again. I said it had to be Jim to play Scrooge because he can be tragic and terrible - and also hilarious.\" The critics seemed largely to be won over by Broadbent's take on one of the meanest men in literature, despite concerns that the actor is just too nice to be convincing. Dominic Cavendish of the Telegraph was among those won over: \"The spirit is one of send-up; and Scrooge is, perhaps for the first time ever, having a laugh - albeit at the expense of the poor.... This is Dickens retained in cod-period yet nodding to our own banking age. \"All told, this is a surprising, quirky reading which traditionalists may find hard to stomach, but Dickens' hardy perennial is robust enough to take the knockabout.\" Tiffany Pritchard of the Londonist said: \"Furthering to the overall lighthearted, and equally over-the-top, tone is the wonderfully charismatic Jim Broadbent whose animated grumblings and comedic gestures make the otherwise cantankerous Ebenezer Scrooge almost endearing. \"With a few 'tickety-boos' and the occasional song and dance number, the show at times feels more panto than stage play \u00e2\u20ac\u201d but judging from the finale's standing ovation \u00e2\u20ac\u201d that's not a bad thing.\" While Lyn Gardner of the Guardian described Broadbent's Scrooge as \"genial and cuddly\". But she concludes: \"All this is quite fun, warm and silly... Broadbent's Scrooge... is lovable and baby faced even when supposedly at his most curmudgeonly. \"The danger is that amid all this, bonhomie is lost. Scrooge's apparent change of heart is oddly sudden, and there's no sense that he has been on a real emotional journey - rather than simply a jokey one.\" A Christmas Carol is at the Noel Coward Theatre until 30 January.",

        "article": "After an Indian temple chief recently said he would allow women to enter the shrine only after a machine was invented to detect if they were \"pure\" - meaning that they weren't menstruating - outraged women have launched a #HappyToBleed campaign on Facebook to protest against the \"sexist statement\", writes the BBC's Geeta Pandey in Delhi. Menstruation is generally a taboo topic in India, something that is rarely talked about openly. But at the weekend, several photographs popped up on my Facebook page of young Indian women holding placards - some made up of sanitary napkins and tampons - with the slogan \"Happy To Bleed\". A little bit of research led me to this petition, started by college student Nikita Azad, who was annoyed by the sexist remarks made by the head of the famous Sabarimala temple in Kerala. \"A time will come when people will ask if all women should be disallowed from entering the temple throughout the year,\" Prayar Gopalakrishnan, who recently took charge of the hilltop temple dedicated to Lord Ayyappa, told reporters earlier this month. \"These days there are machines that can scan bodies and check for weapons. There will be a day when a machine is invented to scan if it is the 'right time' for a woman to enter the temple. When that machine is invented, we will talk about letting women inside,\" he added. Ms Azad insists that there is no \"right time\" to go into a temple and that women should have to right to go \"wherever they want to and whenever they want to\". The temple priest's comments, she says, reinforce misogyny and strengthen the myths that revolve around women, and that \"Happy To Bleed\" is a counter-campaign against menstrual taboos. Hinduism regards menstruating women as unclean so, during her periods, a woman is not allowed to enter the temple, touch any idols, enter the kitchen or even touch the pickle jar. Many Hindu temples in India - and also globally - have prominent notices displayed at the entrance telling menstruating women that they are not welcome, and many devout Hindu women voluntarily keep away from temples when they are menstruating. But the Sabarimala bars all women in the reproductive age from entering the temple. The temple website explains that as Lord Ayyappa was \"Nithya Brahmachari - or celibate - women between the 10-50 age group are not allowed to enter Sabarimala\". The website adds, rather threateningly, that \"such women who try to enter Sabarimala will be prevented by (the) authorities\" from doing so. Ms Azad says \"we don't believe in religion that considers half the world impure\" and that theirs is \"not a temple-entry campaign\" - it's \"a protest against patriarchy and gender discriminatory practices prevalent in our society\" and that they are fighting against sexism and age-old taboos. Since its launch on Saturday, #HappyToBleed has received a lot of responses, especially from young urban Indian women. \"More than 100 women have posted their photographs on Facebook holding banners and placards, with catchy slogans, and many more have shared these photos on their timelines,\" Ms Azad told the BBC. The campaign has also been picked up by many people on Twitter who have written in with messages of support. Some, however, have also wondered how women can be \"happy\" to bleed since periods can often be pretty painful. \"We are using happy as a word to express sarcasm - as a satire, to taunt the authorities, the patriarchal forces which attach impurity with menstruation,\" Ms Azad explains. \"It may be painful, but it's perfectly normal to bleed and it does not make me impure,\" she adds.

Overturning the selection made by a national federation would have been an unprecedented decision for the BOA.

That doesn't mean they're happy. They say they might revisit the matter should the international federation's investigation bring new issues to the fore. They're aware of the pressure this has put on both athletes and have criticised the apparent lack of transparency that has made GB Taekwondo's decision to leave out the world number one hard to understand. \"That said, after a thorough review, the panel is now sufficiently satisfied that the agreed selection procedures have been followed, and it is on that basis we are ratifying the nomination.\" GB Taekwondo welcomed the BOA decision. Performance director Gary Hall said: \"This has been a long and difficult process for all involved, for the selection panel members and particularly for the two athletes concerned. Both are outstanding candidates and truly world class, both capable of winning medals in London. This has been the most difficult of selection decisions.\" Cook's camp is now considering whether to launch legal action. \"Aaron is naturally incredibly disappointed with the BOA decision,\" said his agent Jamie Cunningham. \"He should be competing in the 2012 Games. It is an absolute disgrace that a British world number one has not been selected for the London Olympics by either his governing body or Olympic Association. \"He is world number one, European champion and has beaten 10 of the top 15 athletes in the Olympic rankings in his most recent fights.

Grow NI said companies were deferring decisions to invest due to the uncertainty over the future of the tax. Corporation Tax is the tax that companies pay on their profits. The current UK rate is 21% whereas in the Republic of Ireland firms pay 12.5%. The devolution of the tax was dependant on welfare reform being implemented. However, the controversial Welfare Reform Bill failed to pass at Stormont on Tuesday night. Eamonn Donaghy of Grow NI, a forum representing major business organisations, said:  \"The power to create tens of thousands of jobs is now within our grasp, but unless our politicians seize this opportunity it will jeopardise significant employment growth opportunities and will increase inequality in Northern Ireland.\" He added:  \"Continued uncertainly around a start date and an agreed rate of corporation tax means that the private sector cannot compete on a level playing field with businesses in the Republic of Ireland. \"Only by having the same rate of corporation tax across the island will we see any significant increase in employment in Northern Ireland. \"Such a change would see increased investment from companies at home and abroad, creating jobs which are much needed in communities everywhere.\" New legislation to devolve corporation tax to Northern Ireland was passed by the House of Lords in March. Invest NI has said that a US business delegation has postponed a potential investment trip to Northern Ireland. The jobs creation agency said it was because the Stormont executive had not yet set the rate of Corporation Tax to be introduced in Northern Ireland, or the date it will take effect. It had previously been suggested Northern Ireland will cut its rate to 12.5%, to match Ireland, from April 2017. Mr Donaghy said: \"The evidence that companies abroad are deferring - sometimes permanently - decisions to invest in Northern Ireland is gravely concerning. \"All of us now understand that the election of a Tory government means that the only growth in employment in the future will come from the private sector, and reduced Corporation Tax will be key to deliver this. \"If our politicians fail to reduce Corporation Tax a future of low investment, net emigration and increased unemployment looks inevitable.\" The legislation to allow Corporation Tax powers to be devolved to Stormont was published in January. The government had aimed to pass the law before May's general election.

Special Report: The Technology of Business Windows XP upgrade proves tricky Smartphone stress: Are you a victim? Quantum computers to crack the world The world is not enough Keeping the cyber thieves at bay It promises much great accuracy in locating where we or objects are on the planet and could have a profound effect on how we live our lives. So far we've used the US GPS (Global Positioning System) which is accurate up to a few metres. Galileo has the potential to offer accuracy up to a few centimetres. The potential practical benefits of more accurate navigation include driverless cars,  more flexible charging systems on toll motorways, more efficient air traffic control, more accurate navigation for ships, and even helping blind people get around cities. It will allow you to know where you are not just in a street - but even in a building. \"Galileo promises to be much more accurate than the US-owned GPS,\" says Steve Smart, head of the space programme at CGI, the Canadian tech company that has been developing some of Galileo's commercial applications. It could also help improve capacity on Europe's rail networks. As many rail signalling systems are still relatively unsophisticated, it means that for safety reasons trains have to be well-separated. Galileo will give much more accurate real-time read-outs of trains' locations, which should allow operators to run more trains on a particular stretch of track - welcome news for many commuters if that means less overcrowding in the rush hour. Source: European Space Agency \"The commercial service has the potential to improve the performance of existing location services for all user communities,\" says Carlo des Dorides, executive director of GSA, Europe's satellite navigation agency. Indeed, driverless cars are being allowed on UK public roads from next year. Last month, Business Secretary Vince Cable said the technology has \"very, very large\" potential. Much of this is due to the prospects of more accurate satellite-derived location data. The real challenge when it comes to accuracy is built-up areas. Here, in \"urban canyons\" a user can effectively be hidden from satellites. In such cases, what's known as signal attenuation - or weakening - and signal refraction off surrounding tall buildings, can reduce accuracy. But in tests, when Galileo has been used alongside GPS and Glonass, it is providing a much more accurate location signal even in urban areas, and is also shortening Time-to-First-Fix (TTFF) - the time it takes for your device to lock on to signals from the satellites. However, the project is hugely expensive, and Galileo has been plagued by delays and cost over-runs. Setting up the system and deploying the satellites is costing about 5bn euros (\u00c2\u00a33.9bn; $6.6bn), a significant sum when budgets across Europe are under pressure. Yet the bill could rise still further. With annual operating expenditure of 750m euros over 20 years, Galileo's total costs could be more than 20bn euros, says the eurosceptic think-tank, Open Europe.",

Kadiza Sultana, who joined so-called Islamic State (IS) last year aged 16, is feared dead after an air strike in Raqqa, her family solicitor has said. Labour's Rushanara Ali said the Prevent strategy needed a \"proper assessment\". Security minister Ben Wallace said it had been reviewed \"to ensure it works\". Ms Ali, MP for Bethnal Green and Bow told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme the government needed to establish \"what's working and what's not\". But Mr Wallace said \"ever since Labour introduced Prevent in 2007, the government has continued to review the policy to ensure it works to protect people from being radicalised\". \"For Prevent to work we all need to get behind it not stand on the sidelines undermining it,\" he added. Who are Britain\u2019s jihadists? The Britons signing up for Jihad Kadiza and school friends Shamima Begum and Amira Abase, both 15 at the time, flew from Gatwick to Turkey on 17 February 2015 after telling their parents they were going out for the day. The Bethnal Green Academy pupils later entered Syria and were thought to be living in Raqqa, an IS stronghold. The three girls had been studying for their GCSEs at Bethnal Green Academy, in Tower Hamlets, east London - where they have been described as \"straight-A students\". Tasnime Akunjee, a solicitor representing the families of the three schoolgirls, told BBC Newsnight they heard a report of Kadiza's death following a Russian air strike a few weeks ago. He said they had not been able to independently confirm it because of the nature of information from Syria. By Frank Gardner, BBC security correspondent Kadiza Sultana and her two travelling companions were part of a surge of young British Muslims heading out to Syria to join so-called IS in a movement that peaked more than a year ago. Today the surge has turned to barely a trickle. The latest UK Government counter-terrorism strategy report puts the number of Britons who reached Syria at about 850  - although unofficial estimates are higher. Of those, about 125 are believed to have been killed, either by air strikes or by fighting on the ground, and about 400 are thought to have returned to Britain. Anyone known to have travelled to IS-controlled territory is automatically questioned by the police and assessed on a case-by-case basis. If there is any evidence of terrorist-related activity they face prosecution, but others are steered towards deradicalisation programmes and given counselling, with a view to reintegrating them into society here. It is the job of the Home Office and the police to make the correct assessments. Under laws brought in last summer, schools have a legal obligation, known as the \"Prevent Duty\", to spot and report individuals who might be vulnerable to extremism and radicalisation. Schools have to assess the risk of pupils being drawn into extremist ideologies and schools must ensure pupils do not access extremist material online. Teachers have previously warned the strategy is \"shutting down\" open debate in schools, encouraging a climate of \"over-reaction\", and creating \"suspicion and confusion\" in schools. The government has said Prevent is playing \"a key role\" in identifying children at risk of radicalisation. However, Ms Ali told Today the case of the three schoolgirls highlighted the fact it was not working. \"Many have concerns about how Prevent is being implemented, concerns about young Muslims being stigmatised,\" she said. \"There needs to be a balance struck to protect young people, to prevent them from being radicalised, but also making sure teachers and other agencies have the proper advice training and support.\" She added: \"What the government needs to do is do a proper assessment of what's working and what's not and they need to listen to the Muslim community... \"But that requires partnership between communities.\" Security minister Ben Wallace defended the strategy. \"Up and down the country we are successfully seeing communities, local authorities and ordinary citizens doing their bit to protect the vulnerable from those that would seek to groom them for extremist activities,\" he said. \"Prevent is for the benefit of us all no matter what faith or community you belong to. As it is with domestic violence or other forms of abuse it is everyone's duty to be proactive to stop those that would subvert our young people.\" Sara Khan, co-founder of the counter-extremism organisation Inspire, told Today that she saw Kadiza as a victim, \"because she's not an adult\". Young girls who are exposed to radicalisation \"lack critical thinking skills\", which \"is what makes them vulnerable to Islamist extremist propaganda in particular\", she said. She added that girls being exposed to extremist material were \"not receiving counter-messages\". The Bethnal Green schoolgirls were among more than 800 Britons who are believed to have left the UK to join IS or other militant groups in Syria and Iraq, In February 2015 the principal of Bethnal Green Academy, Mark Keary, said there was no evidence that the girls were radicalised at school, adding that pupils could not access Twitter or Facebook on its computers. It later emerged that, before leaving the UK, Shamima Begum had sent a Twitter message to Aqsa Mahmood, who left Glasgow for Syria in 2013 to marry an Islamic State fighter. A spokeswoman for the Foreign Office said: \"The UK has advised for some time against all travel to Syria. As all UK consular services there are suspended, it is extremely difficult to confirm the status and whereabouts of British nationals in Syria. \"Anyone who does travel to these areas, for whatever reason, is putting themselves in considerable danger.\"",

        "article": "A man who described himself in court as looking like John Travolta has been found guilty of the rape and murder of a teenager 34 years ago. James Warnock, 56, has been convicted of the \"horrifying\" killing of Yiannoulla Yianni, 17, in 1982. She was attacked while home alone in Hampstead, north London, the Old Bailey heard. Warnock, formerly of Harrington Street, north-west London, was 22 at the time, and had denied the charges. The case was one of the Met Police's unsolved murders before DNA samples from the scene matched to the former tiler in December last year. In a victim impact statement Yiannoulla's family said: \"For over half a lifetime we have had to live with the daily torture of what happened to our daughter and sister Lucy. \"All who knew her, loved and adored her. \"We now pray that we can move forward with the rest of our lives having some peace in knowing that her killer has been brought to justice and that a very dangerous man is no longer a threat to anyone else.\" It was not until 1999 that DNA could be extracted from the bedspread in the case. The court heard the Met Police got a \"lucky break\" in December when Warnock was arrested over indecent images of children and had to give a DNA sample. The sample was found to be a match to semen found at the murder scene. Reporting restrictions were lifted when Warnock admitted six indecent images offences relating to photos of young children and a baby in 2013 and 2015. Warnock had earlier described himself to the court as having been very slim with dark hair, styled like the actor John Travolta, at the time of the murder on 13 August 1982. Prosecutor Crispin Aylett QC told the trial that Yiannoulla had been with her parents parents Elli and George Yianni at their shoe repair shop a short distance from their home on the day of the attack, but went home early to prepare supper. A man in his early 20s was spotted chatting with to her on the doorstep, before a neighbour heard a scream about 20 minutes later, the jury heard. Her parents returned home to find jewellery scattered on the stairs and called out to her, before finding her partially naked body on their bed. During the trial he claimed he had been in a sexual relationship with the schoolgirl after meeting her at the family's shop, but the court heard she was a virgin before the attack. Warnock was living about half-a-mile from Yiannoulla's house at the time of her death, the court heard. Police said he had continued to live in the community in the years since the attack.

The hosts needed only 66 minutes and 82 deliveries to take the remaining seven England wickets in Centurion. Kagiso Rabada, 20, became the youngest South Africa bowler to take 10 wickets in a match, and finished with 6-32 to add to his first-innings 7-112. Morne Morkel claimed 3-36, with James Taylor's 24 the highest score for England, who won the series 2-1. England, beaten 2-0 by Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates earlier this winter, next play Test cricket against Sri Lanka at Headingley on 19 May. Having reduced England to 52-3 on Monday, South Africa hurried through the rest of the order thanks to some splendid bowling on a wearing surface. In all, England lost their last seven wickets for 43 runs in 10.5 overs as any hopes of batting out the day vanished amid a flurry of reckless strokes. Here's how the collapse unfolded: Fittingly, the lithe paceman, in only his sixth Test match, took the final three wickets as England were skittled out before a drinks break was required. That gave Rabada match figures of 13-144, the best by a South Africa bowler on home soil and the second-best in their history. The man of the match, who was also the leading wicket-taker in the series, said: \"It was a bit up and down so the key was the hit the deck and bowl the ball in a good area and I believed you'd get your rewards.\" Former England captain Michael Vaughan told BBC Test Match Special: \"England have batted on a pitch with a bit of spice and they have shown no heart. \"It's almost like the white towel has been thrown in. It was a really feeble way to finish the tour.\" Former England batsman Geoffrey Boycott: \"Get your head down and save the match. But there was no effort this morning. \"Coming out and playing shots, does that excuse you after winning the series? No. There's no excuse for that. You have to be professional. That's not good enough.\" Media playback is not supported on this device England captain Alastair Cook: \"We always try and play positively but on certain wickets you have to play a different way. We didn't get the balance right. \"Whether that's the end of the tour mentality I don't know. If you'd offered me 2-1 before the series I would have snapped your hand off.\" England face a South Africa Invitation XI in a warm-up game on Saturday before a five-match one-day series against South Africa gets under way on 3 February. Proteas pace bowler Dale Steyn will play no part in the ODI campaign as he continues his recovery from the shoulder injury which kept him out of the third and fourth Tests.

Fire crews in south Wales have dealt with 623 deliberately-set grass fires since 1 April. Now residents have approached South Wales Fire and Rescue Service to volunteer as \"spotters\". It comes as 45 firefighters are tackling one fire, covering 148 acres (60 hectares), in the Swansea Valley. Crews were called to the mountain fire at Godre'r Graig, between Pontardawe and Ystalyfera, at about 08:00 BST. On Monday it was revealed that children as young as 11 are among those who have been arrested for starting blazes in south Wales. Gareth Davies, a fire service group manager with responsibility for Rhondda Cynon Taff and Merthyr, told BBC Wales' Good Morning Wales programme residents had \"had enough\". \"Residents are contacting us... to see if they can get involved, if they can help us and support us in terms of maybe going out onto the mountains. \"A number of them are getting together and spotting for us... where the fires are being located and trying to locate where the perpetrators are and pass that on to the police. \"So that is a positive and I would implore people if they do want to get involved with us then by all means go to their local fire stations and we can work together to hopefully stop this happening.\" A community group calling itself Mountain Fire Prevention Team (RCT) has been set up on Facebook. The group said its key aim was to \"help the fire service and the police by trying to prevent mountain fires\" by organising foot patrols along the mountains. The group's Facebook profile reads: \"The fire service does not have the man power to patrol the mountains, so if we were able to do it, it would take some strain away from them.\" The RSPCA has also warned the fires were posing a \"great risk\" to wild animals, especially at a time of year when many are very young and unable to escape fires. On 14 April the charity was approached by South Wales Fire and Rescue Service after a burnt hedgehog was found in Pontypridd. A spokeswoman said, \"Fire not only kills wildlife but will also displace surviving animals from their territory, creating problems such as territorial disputes when they move on to new areas. \"Species that live in dens, burrows and warrens can become trapped by the flames and smoke and suffocate.\"",

David Dixon texted his aunt saying he was safe after the two airport blasts, but his family fear he was caught up in a further explosion at a Metro station. Mr Dixon, from Nottingham, lived in the capital with his partner Charlotte Sutcliffe and their son. He is thought to be the only Briton still missing since Tuesday's attacks. Downing Street said four Britons were injured in the blasts, which left 31 people dead. Mr Dixon's partner told the Telegraph that police have his dental records and are seeing if they match any of the victims. How the day unfolded What we know about the attacks so far Airport security under the spotlight again Full coverage of the Brussels attacks His friend Simon Hartley-Jones said the couple had lived in Brussels for about 10 years but still had a house in Nottingham and came back regularly. \"David is a programmer and works in the centre of Brussels,\" said Mr Hartley-Jones. \"He makes his way there every day using the Metro system. \"For some reason he hasn't made it... and we're really concerned about him. \"It's really unusual for him not to contact [Charlotte] - it's really out of character.\" Updates on this story and more from Nottinghamshire He described Mr Dixon, originally from Hartlepool, as \"a lovely guy\" and \"an amazing man who deeply, deeply loves his son\". The couple's son was staying with friends and was unaware his father was missing, he added. \"They still have a house in Mapperley [in Nottingham] which they come back to regularly, this is their home. \"They were supposed to come back this weekend, all the family were due back this weekend to spend Easter with us here, and we're missing them deeply.\" Mr Hartley-Jones has appealed for anyone in Belgium who might know of Mr Dixon's whereabouts to get in touch. \"Charlotte is just desperately looking for David and we need any information you can get,\" he said. \"Please just check in hospitals in Brussels, just check that David is not one of your patients, and just let us know.\" Ms Sutcliffe's sister, Marie, said they were hoping to hear from a hospital or police that he had perhaps been injured but was safe. \"Not everybody has been identified yet among the injured, so it's just waiting for that process to happen,\" she said. She plans to go out to Brussels to support her sister. \"Understandably she's very, very distressed,\" she said. \"It's just waiting, which is heartbreaking and very worrying.\" Mr Dixon's cousin, Philip Dixon, said his family was \"fearing the worst\". \"He takes the Metro to work and unfortunately it's looking like he could have been on this Metro train at the time of this bombing yesterday,\" he said. \"Charlotte tried phoning his work and he didn't turn in for work yesterday morning so we are fearing the worst at the moment.\" Downing Street said four Britons were confirmed to have been injured in the twin blasts which hit Zaventem airport at about 07:00 GMT and Maelbeek Metro station an hour later. So-called Islamic State (IS) has claimed responsibility for the attacks. A No 10 spokesman said: \"We are concerned about one missing British national and we are in close contact with the Belgian authorities. \"We are aware of four British nationals who were injured in the attacks - three are being treated in hospital, one has already been discharged. \"Our embassy staff are working to assist all British nationals affected.\" Mr Dixon has been working as an IT contractor for securities settlement group Euroclear, which has an office a few Metro stops away from the station that was attacked.

        "article": "The treatment of employees in public services who have raised concerns about wrongdoing has often been \"shocking\", a group of MPs has said. The Commons Public Accounts Committee said whistleblowers had often been subjected to bullying and harassment. Its report called for whistleblowers to be offered legal and counselling help and for \"swift sanctions\" to be imposed on staff who victimised them. The government said it was acting to ensure people felt free to speak out. The report highlighted the \"important\" role whistleblowers had played in uncovering details about the Hillsborough disaster and the Mid Staffordshire NHS trust scandal. The committee said whistleblowing was a \"crucial source of intelligence to help government identify wrongdoing\". However, it found there had been a \"startling disconnect\" between policies encouraging whistleblowers in theory and what happened in practice. The report said it had \"heard of too many cases of appalling treatment of whistleblowers by their colleagues\". Officials who tried to raise concerns often had to show \"remarkable courage\" in coming forward. The report highlighted whistleblowing in relation to the Hillsborough disaster on 15 April 1989, where 96 Liverpool fans at an FA Cup semi-final lost their lives. Prime Minister David Cameron later apologised for the \"double injustice\" of the disaster, after an independent report published in 2012 showed police and emergency services had attempted to deflect the blame. It also highlighted the Mid Staffordshire NHS scandal, where staff at Stafford Hospital had blown the whistle on \"appalling care\" between 2005 and 2008. The committee heard from Kay Sheldon, a member of the board of the Care Quality Commission who, the report said, had been \"victimised\" by senior officials after she tried to raise concerns about the way it had been operating. The report said no-one had faced any form of sanction over her treatment. Labour MP Margaret Hodge, who chairs the public accounts committee, said whistleblowing was \"crucial\" and must be taken seriously by all chief executives of major companies and public sector organisations. She said protection for whistleblowers was still not adequate, citing the example of Osita Mba - a former lawyer at Revenue and Customs who drew attention to what he claimed were \"sweetheart deals\" between the tax authorities and Goldman Sachs. She said Mr Mba was a \"really brave guy\" but it had become \"impossible for him\" to remain with the organisation after his disclosures and he had had \"to start his life again elsewhere\". \"The way you support whistleblowers is hugely important,\" she added. \"I think it is really important that there are proper sanctions in place in an organisation so if someone does blow the whistle, they are properly supported and if anyone dares bully or harass them, they are not only reprimanded but punished.\" Legal protections for whistleblowers The 1998 Public Disclosure Act protects workers who disclose information about potential criminal behaviour and other malpractice at their workplace, or former workplace, provided certain conditions are met. Depending on the nature of information disclosed and who it is confided to, a whistleblower is legally protected from suffering from any detriment as a result. If these conditions are not met, a disclosure may constitute a breach of the worker's duty of confidence to his employer. The laws apply to direct employees and agency workers but not those working for the security services, and campaign group Public Concern at Work says other individuals - such as volunteers and interns - are also excluded. The law was amended last year to include a specific public interest test, whereby whistleblowers have to \"reasonably believe\" that their actions are in the public interest to be protected. Workers who raise concerns about bullying and harassment by work colleagues are also protected. Colleagues who victimise them are personally liable for their actions while their employers are  \"vicariously liable\". The Taxpayers' Alliance said the report suggested there was a \"culture of secrecy\" in much of the public sector and whistleblowing must be encouraged. \"Though the practice often asks tough questions, it is a crucial tool to increase the accountability of those in charge and to ensure our public services work as well as possible for the people who need them,\" the campaign group's chief executive Jonathan Isaby said. A government spokeswoman said: \"All civil servants must be able to raise concerns so that poor services and inefficient operations can be identified and acted upon. \"That is why this government is ensuring people feel free to speak out. Awareness of how to raise a complaint has risen by 20% and two-thirds of civil servants feel that any complaint will be investigated properly. \"In addition, we are ensuring that all departments have a clear whistleblowing policy.\" Labour said whistleblowing had led, in many cases, to major changes in policy. \"There must be a clear standardised policy for handling whistleblowers working across all of our public services to ensure that there are no disparities in how people are dealt with, and that staff are protected from being victimised.\" said shadow Cabinet Office minister Michael Dugher.",

Ireland team manager Mick Kearney said that the Irish are adopting a \"wait and see\" attitude over centre Payne's recovery from a hamstring injury. If Payne is ruled out, his Ulster colleague Stuart McCloskey will be in contention for a first cap. Props Mike Ross and Cian Healy are available to bolster the scrum after missing Ireland's first two games. The Irish scrum struggled badly in the second half of the defeat by France and the return of the Leinster duo after injury will be a boost to coach Joe Schmidt. Loose-head Healy has returned to Leinster duty in recent weeks after knee surgery while tight-head Ross has recovered from hamstring trouble. \"They both participated in Leinster's last two games and both got a significant amount of game-time at the weekend against Cardiff,\" said Kearney of Healy and Ross on Monday afternoon. \"So they're in, fully fit and available for selection.\" Kearney appeared less certain of Payne's fitness. \"Jared Payne is continuing his rehab and the hope is that he will train fully tomorrow,\" added the Ireland team manager. \"He did some running last week and will continue with that rehab today.\" Payne was initially thought to have suffered a dead leg in the Paris game but it was later diagnosed as a hamstring problem. Fears over Johnny Sexton's fitness appear to have eased after he picked up a neck injury in Paris and then strained an ankle in training on Friday. Ross and Healy join Ulster wing Craig Gilroy plus Munster lock Dave Foley and Leinster flanker Jordi Murphy in being added to the Ireland squad for the Twickenham contest. Munster pair Keith Earls and Simon Zebo, who started in the draw against Wales, are included after missing the defeat by France because of injury. Sean O'Brien, Dave Kearney and Mike McCarthy have all been ruled out of the remainder of the tournament after picking up injuries in the France game.

After the daunting match against England, Joe Schmidt's side then finish their campaign with home games against Italy and Scotland on 12 and 19 March.

        "article": "A \"groundbreaking\" cystic fibrosis therapy could profoundly improve patients' quality of life, say doctors. Patients often die before their 40s as mucus clogs and damages their lungs and leaves them prone to infection. A major trial on 1,108 patients, in the New England Journal of Medicine, showed a combination of drugs could bypass the genetic errors that cause the disease and may increase life expectancy. The Cystic Fibrosis Trust said it could \"improve the lives of many\". One in every 2,500 babies in the UK has cystic fibrosis. Errors in sufferers' DNA - inherited from their parents - damage the microscopic machinery that controls salt and water levels in the linings of the lungs. The result is a thick mucus that inexorably damages the lungs. Antibiotics help prevent infection and drugs can loosen the mucus, but nothing deals with the fundamental problem for most patients. The combination of drugs - lumacaftor and ivacaftor - were designed to repair that microscopic machinery. The trial showed that those patients given the cocktail for 24 weeks had better lung function. Cystic fibrosis also affects the mucus lining in the gut so the doctors were pleased to see the patients also gained weight in the trial. Prof Stuart Elborn, who led the European part of the trial from Queen's University Belfast, told the BBC News website: \"This is very exciting and it really demonstrates that we can correct the basic defects in cystic fibrosis. \"This is likely to become a fundamental treatment for cystic fibrosis. \"Starting in children may prevent the disease process developing if we correct the basic defect early in life. \"Will this improve survival for people with cystic fibrosis?  We would anticipate it would have a really good chance of doing that, but we don't know for sure yet.\" There are however, many types of error in the DNA that can culminate in cystic fibrosis. This treatment combination should work on around half of patients, while one of the drugs on its own corrects a small proportion of errors. New treatments are still required for the remaining patients. Susanna McColley, professor of paediatrics at Northwestern University, said these were \"groundbreaking findings\" that showed the future of treating cystic fibrosis. She told the BBC: \"For subjects I've cared for, they felt better in ways that are not necessarily measurable. \"One young woman said, and this is a direct quote, her CF 'is not a problem'.\" Janet Allen, the director of research at the Cystic Fibrosis Trust charity, said: \"These results open up a new front in the fight against cystic fibrosis and this combination therapy looks set to be an important additional treatment option that could improve the lives of many. \"As this leading edge of science continues to be explored and better understood, we are hopeful that a future of personalised medicines is increasingly within reach.\" The therapy is being examined by regulators around the world.",

        "article": "In our series of letters from African journalists, Ghanaian writer Elizabeth Ohene looks at the uproar that greeted Ghana's decision to allow two Yemenis freed from the US jail in Guantanamo Bay to live in the West African state. There is a general belief here that if you typed Ghana or Ghanaian into a search engine, the words that would be suggested automatically as a follow-up should be politics and football. It is these two subjects that spark animated discussions and get the juices flowing. Even though in football, we have not won anything on the continental or world stage for a very long time, we still believe that the Black Stars, our national team, are special. One of the inner sources of the strength that help Ghanaians survive is the fact that our national team regularly beats the national team of the United States at football. Trying to get a visa from Ghana to the United States is one of the most humiliating experiences for Ghanaians. But we are able to endure it all by simply repeating over and over again under our breaths: \"World Cup 2006, we defeated you, World Cup 2010, we defeated you.\" Now, we discovered quite unexpectedly that defeating the US at football has even deeper implications, when news broke that our government had accepted two Yemeni ex-detainees, Khalid al-Dhuby and Mahmoud Omar Bin Atef, from Guantanamo Bay, where the US detains terror suspects, to live in Ghana. Elizabeth Ohene: \"They are excited to come to Ghana because of Asamoah Gyan, the captain of the Black Star - they know him and they like him very much\" The government has struggled to explain this decision. We have been told the two men pose no danger whatsoever to Ghana; they were innocent 20-year-olds when they were arrested and to drive home their innocence, our president compares them to his own 20-year-old son. We have been told that even though the two men are such thoroughly harmless and nice people, their every move will be monitored. Normally taciturn officials from the US embassy are suddenly all over the radio and television trying to assure us we should all be proud of our government for bringing to Ghana men the US Senate deems too dangerous to enter their country. When none of these interventions appeared to be calming the protests, the two thoroughly harmless and nice men were brought out to state their own case on national radio. Guantanamo Bay prison: The pair said they do not belong to any terrorist group, and have been wrongly arrested for 14 years without any charge. They have suffered but are not looking for revenge. They want to live in Ghana quietly and peacefully, and put their lives together. All that did not sound very convincing to any of us here; what everybody really wanted to know was why they had been brought to Ghana - did they just pick us on the map because Ghana happens to be the physical centre of the world? And suddenly it all comes tumbling out. They are excited to come to Ghana because of Asamoah Gyan, the captain of the Black Stars, they know him and they like him very much. A lot of the detainees like Ghanaians very much, and during the 2010 World Cup, most of the people there in Guantanamo Bay - no, not most of them, all of them -  were with Ghana and when the Black Stars beat America, they were very happy. So now we know... beating America at football has consequences. I am afraid I don't know what happened to our secret supporters in Guantanamo in 2014. They obviously did not cheer loud enough that year, which must be why we lost to the US. And for that reason alone, I think our two long-term visitors should be sent back to reorganize our supporters club in Guantanamo. More from Elizabeth Ohene:",

Truck drivers are resorting to cocaine, speed and ecstasy to help keep themselves awake on long journeys. Drug testing firms say to have 10% of drivers in an haulage firm test positive for drugs was \"not unusual\". Road safety minister Mike Penning insists Britain's roads are among the safest in the world. One lorry driver speaking to the BBC's5 live Investigatesprogramme, who works for a major international haulage company, claims he regularly sees drivers use ecstasy, cannabis, speed and cocaine to relieve the boredom of lengthy shifts. The highly experienced driver has tried to raise the issue with managers at his firm but says nobody wants to take responsibility and tries to pass the buck to another department. The driver, who spoke anonymously, says fellow drivers have in the past veered off motorways or overturned, and in some instances were not even able to remember the incident afterwards. In one incident the insider was told about, a heavily drugged-up driver ploughed into workmen's vehicles by the side of a motorway. When questioned by the police the driver was only tested for alcohol and he was not arrested. \"They are basically taking a recreational drug like ecstasy and speed to keep themselves awake because of the distances involved and because boredom just kicks in,\" said the driver. He explained that drivers got around rules governing how many hours they were allowed to work by taking two tachograph cards, which record driver hours, speed and distance.

Contact 5 live Investigates To make it look like two drivers were operating a vehicle, when it was in fact one, drivers simply swapped the cards around at the end of a shift. The driver's testimony is backed-up by a number of drug testing companies contacted by 5 live Investigates. The companies did not want to be identified for fear of losing business but revealed they knew about a substantial number of positive readings among truck and van drivers. One firm carrying out tests for a major haulage company for the first time found 10% of drivers tested positive for illegal drugs, but said none of them lost their jobs. Told of 5 live's findings, another drug testing firm said in its experience 10% of drivers testing positive for illegal drugs in the transport industry was \"not outrageous or surprising\". That was backed up by a third testing firm which revealed a company that employs around 5,000 courier drivers, found around 10% of its drivers tested positive for illegal drugs. Another insider who assesses risk for major companies told the BBC how one firm tested 300 young van drivers in their 20s, and more than 40 of them tested positive for illegal drugs. In evidence submitted to the Commons Transport Select Committee the Road Haulage Association (RHA) said the vast majority of its members do not test drivers for drugs as they do no believe drug use among drivers to be a significant problem. Of those companies which do carry out drug tests the RHA said they reported no significant problem. However, the RHA admitted that a substantial minority of its members who do not currently test drivers suspect there is a significant problem within the industry. The anonymous driver speaking to 5 live said: \"It's nothing unusual to see drivers rolling joints while they're driving along the motorway and they're holding the steering wheel in their knees. \"That's why they're driving at 50 miles per hour. That's not a strong drug but it still shouldn't be taken while driving. \"But for the longer journey - eight or nine hours - they're taking ecstasy. \"I was talking to a lad two weeks ago and, literally 10 minutes before, had taken ecstasy to try and keep awake and get back up because he had another seven hours in front of him. \"He said he hadn't been to sleep for two days.\" Campaigners are now calling for a change to the law to bring the road transport industry in line with the railway industry where there is a statutory duty to ensure drivers are drug-free. They also want haulage companies to take more responsibility for their drivers' actions. Julie Willis's 23-year-old daughter Louise Cooper was killed by lorry driver Lee Baker in 2008 - he admitted smoking cannabis the previous afternoon and was driving at 60mph in fog when he crashed into Miss Cooper at the roadside. Traces of cannabis were found in Mr Baker's lorry. Mrs Willis says employers should have a statutory duty to check the competency of their drivers. The toxicology report on Mr Baker, seen by 5 Live Investigates, shows cannabis was found in a blood sample. However, because of a delay in blood sampling the toxicologist was unable to say whether or not he was under the influence at the time of the incident. He was jailed for 14 months after admitting one count of death by dangerous driving because it was not known whether or not the cannabis played any part in the accident. Mrs Willis said she is angry that the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) did not feel it was in the public interest to pursue the drugs matter. In a statement, Chief Crown Prosecutor for the East of England Ken Caley said: \"The most senior lawyers in CPS East of England, including myself, were involved in the decision. \"We thoroughly considered the material arising from the police investigation and concluded that there was insufficient evidence to prove that Mr Baker was under the influence of drugs when the incident which lead to the tragic death of Louise Cooper took place. \"We continue to offer our sincere condolences to Mrs Willis and her family for their tragic loss\". Mrs Willis told the BBC: \"The crux of the matter is that drug testing must take place within six hours of the accident and the driver's impairment must be proven, unlike in the case of alcohol.\" \"The Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (Vosa) ensure vehicles have to be kept in tip-top condition but if the driver is under the influence of drink and/or drugs, the condition of the vehicle is irrelevant.\" Road Safety Minister Mike Penning insisted Britain's roads were among the safest in the world. \"Drug driving is a menace, which is why we are going to introduce a new drug driving offence and approve screening equipment to make it easier for the police to test for the presence of drugs in drivers and tackle this irresponsible minority,\" he told BBC 5 live. \"We are currently putting together a panel of experts to advise us on the technical aspects of introducing a new offence of driving with an illegal drug in your body and expect them to meet in the next few weeks to finalise their terms of reference. \"We are not complacent and I am determined to crack down on those who continue to put lives at risk by drug driving.\" You can listen to the full report on5 live Investigateson Sunday, 1 April at 21:00 BST onBBC Radio 5 live.

        "article": "Middle-income as well as low-income families are being held back by a \"deep social mobility problem\" in Britain, a report warns. The Social Mobility Commission warns of many \"treadmill families running harder and harder but standing still\". It points to an unfair education system, a two-tier labour market, a regionally imbalanced economy and unaffordable housing. Prime Minister Theresa May has promised to tackle social inequalities. The commission's State of the Nation 2016 report, laid before Parliament on Wednesday,  says young families now can no longer expect to do as well as their parents' generation. It highlights that home ownership is in sharp decline, particularly among young people. The commission urges the government to commit to building three million homes over the next decade and to expand the sale of public sector land for new homes. It should also allow targeted housebuilding on green-belt land and modify the starter home initiative to focus on households with average incomes. Alan Milburn paints a depressingly familiar picture of a \"them and us\" Britain divided along the fault-lines of wealth and opportunity. But the conclusion of his report - most families are now doing worse than their parents' generation - is staggering. It means social mobility is going backwards not forwards, despite successive attempts to tackle it. Phrases such as: \"Huge swathes of Britain feel left behind,\" and: \"The chickens have now come home to roost,\" pepper the report. \"So many families are struggling to get by, let alone get up,\" Mr Milburn said. He highlights that of the 65 parts of the country identified by his commission as \"social mobility coldspots\", only three voted to remain in the EU. Mr Milburn, himself immersed in issues surrounding the social mobility conundrum for six years, clearly feels the country's mood is now becoming dangerous. And with a nod to 1930s Europe, he told reporters:  \"We know from the history of our own continent, when people feel they are losing out unfairly, the mood can turn ugly.\" The commission notes that a child living in one of England's most disadvantaged areas is 27 times more likely to go to an inadequate school than a child in the most advantaged areas. And young people from low-income homes are one-third more likely to drop out of education than better-off classmates with similar GCSEs. The report says the government should have \"as its core objective\" the narrowing within the next decade of the GCSE attainment gap between poorer children and their better-off classmates by two-thirds. It also urges the government to rethink its plans for more grammar schools and more academies. The report says grammars are \"at best, a distraction, and, at worst, a risk to efforts aimed at narrowing the significant social and geographical divides that bedevil England's school system\". The report notes a growing gap between the generations, warning that those born in the 1980s are the first post-war cohort not to start their working lives on higher salaries than their immediate predecessors. It says the government must work with large employers, local councils and Local Enterprise Partnerships to bring high-quality job opportunities - backed by financial incentives - to Britain's social mobility \"coldspots\". The report also calls for an end to unpaid internships, arguing that work placements lasting more than four weeks should be paid at the minimum wage. The commission says the problem is not just social, but also geographical, with a widening divide between the big cities - particularly London - and the many towns and counties being \"left behind economically and hollowed-out socially\". It says that in London, the number of top-end occupational jobs has increased by 700,000 in the past 10 years compared with just under 56,000 in the north-east of England. The report warns: \"The growing sense that we have become an us and them society - where a few unfairly hoard wealth and power - is deeply corrosive of our cohesion as a society. \"The EU referendum in June this year exposed deep divides that go well beyond the box that people crossed. \"Public concern - even anger - about issues of identity, immigration and inequality found a voice on 23 June and a target to aim at. \"Of the 65 parts of the country we identified as being social mobility coldspots - those with the poorest education and employment prospects - only three areas voted to remain in the EU.\" Other concerns raised by the report include: The chair of the Social Mobility Commission, Alan Milburn, said the rungs on the social mobility ladder were growing further apart. \"It is becoming harder for this generation of struggling families to move up,\" he said. \"Whole sections of society and whole tracts of Britain feel left behind. \"As the EU referendum result showed, the public mood is sour and decision-makers have been far too slow to respond.\" Theresa May took over as prime minister in July with a promise to lead a \"one-nation\" government that worked for all, not just the \"privileged few\". Mr Milburn said the commission applauded her determination to further social progress but warned this was a \"big ambition\" and should be the \"holy grail\" of public policy. A government spokeswoman said ministers would  consider the recommendations in the report. \"We want to make this a country that works for everyone, not just the privileged few - whether it's education, jobs, or housing, this means giving families more control over their lives  and doing more to help those who are just managing. \"As the prime minister said on the steps of Downing Street, this government is committed to fighting injustice wherever it arises and ensuring that everyone in our country has the opportunity to go as far as their talents will take them.\" Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner  said the report should make \"sobering reading\" for the Conservatives. \"Since they came to power in 2010, we have seen our country go backwards on the progress the Labour government made on social mobility,\" she said. \"The educational attainment gap between lower-income children and their wealthier classmates is getting bigger, and these children still have little chance of going into high-level professions. \"And under Theresa May we can expect more of the same: grammar schools for a select few, overcrowded classrooms for the many.\" The report was published as a survey of 1,655 British adults for the commission found nearly half believed where people ended up in life was mainly down to their background and parentage. Fewer than a third (29%) of people questioned thought Britain was a country where everyone could get as far as their talent and hard work would take them. One-third of those surveyed said they could not save any money each month. Join the conversation - find us on Facebook",

Sightings of creepy clowns have sparked minor hysteria across the US since August. People in clown masks have reportedly chased others and tried to lure children into woods. Victoria police warned that such escapades would \"not be tolerated\". Creepy clown sightings leave US baffled 'Killer clowns' come to Canada Lurking clown arrested in Kentucky woods In a statement on its Facebook page, which appears to have since been deleted, the force wrote: \"Victoria Police are aware of people who are parading in public wearing clown masks. \"The clown purge appears to be a copycat of incidents being seen in the USA recently. \"Any intimidating and threatening as well as anti-social behaviours will not be tolerated and will be investigated by Police.\" Clowns have also been spotted in Sydney, with one pictured loitering outside a fast food restaurant in the Campbelltown area. Australians have responded by setting up Facebook pages dedicated to \"clown hunting\", as the sightings spread. One theory has it that the upswing in \"killer clown\" antics is linked to the release of novelist Stephen King's new film, It. The plot involves a child-slaughtering being which takes the form of a clown called Pennywise to lure its prey. But King has criticised the craze. This week, he tweeted: \"Hey, guys, time to cool the clown hysteria - most of em are good, cheer up the kiddies, make people laugh.\" The sinister craze began in South Carolina with reports that men dressed as clowns were trying to coax children into the woods with money. It was followed by sightings in Alabama, Georgia and Pennsylvania. Schools in Texas and Alabama have even shut down over the phenomenon. On Tuesday, White House press secretary Josh Earnest told a press briefing that President Barack Obama had not been briefed on the issue, but added, \"this is a situation that local law enforcement authorities take quite seriously\". Reports suggest New Zealand has also been sucked into the epidemic, after a clown \"lurking\" at a school spooked parents on Wednesday. Some professional clowns fear the negative trend may put them in physical danger. Professional clown Jordan Jones, who goes by the name Snuggles, has started a #ClownLivesMatter movement, inspired by the #BlackLivesMatter campaign, to remind the public that real clowns want to spread happiness, not fear.",

The six male athletes also said they engaged in disruptive behaviour. The admission follows a report that assessed Australia's poor swimming performance at the London 2012 Games which pointed to a \"toxic\" team culture. Swimming Australia said the swimmers will face an inquiry panel. Stilnox, used to treat insomnia, is not considered a performance enhancer and is not a banned substance, but the Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) put it on the prohibited list ahead of the Games. In their statement, the six members of the men's 4x100 freestyle relay team said the prescriptions \"were filled in Australia before their departure to their staging camp in Spain and prior to the AOC's announcement the drug was (prohibited)\". But they \"acknowledge that at the time Stilnox was consumed it had been recently prohibited for use\". \"We stand here collectively to confirm that we did take part in a bonding exercise during which members of the relay team took Stilnox,\" the six swimmers said. \"We acknowledge by our recent action in continuing a recent tradition in the Australia swim team, we have let ourselves down and the people who have supported us.\" All but one team member took the medication, they said. Then they engaged in pranks they described as \"childish\" and \"stupid\", such as knocking on the doors of other athletes and making phone calls. They said they were asleep by 22:30. \"I think one of the reasons I agreed to go along with it was all the pressure I was under,\" one of the swimmers, James Magnussen, said. \"Completely inappropriate in hindsight.\" The relay team, nicknamed Weapons of Mass Destruction before the Olympics, came in fourth in the event, in which they had been expected to deliver a medal. Magnussen, a favourite to win the men's 100 metres freestyle, won a silver. Their admission follows the release of a review of the sport after the country's worst Olympic swimming performance in two decades. It found that amid a lack of leadership a \"toxic\" team culture developed that led to bullying and misuse of prescription drugs, and that standards and discipline were \"too loose\".

        "article": "Chinese shares have risen and European markets have opened higher at the end of what has been a torrid first week of the year. It was a week in which trading in China's markets was twice halted by a circuit breaker, before the authorities decided to suspend the measure. The Shanghai Composite closed 2% higher on Friday, but still ended the week down by about 10%. In London, the FTSE 100 was up 55.4 points, or 0.93%, at 6,009.4. In Frankfurt, the Dax was up 1.0%, while the Cac 40 in Paris was up 0.7%. On Thursday, markets in Europe and the US recorded steep losses after trading in China's stock markets closed within the first 30 minutes. The direct financial impact of lower share prices in China is moderate. There is not enough foreign investment in the Chinese market for it to be a major problem. The London consultancy Capital Economics has said foreigners own just 2% of shares. The issue is about whether the financial turbulence shines a light on wider issues about the economic slowdown in China: is the economy heading for what's called a \"hard landing\", too sharp a slowdown? China is now such a big force in the global economy that it would inevitably affect the rest of the world. It is the second largest economy and the second largest importer of both goods and commercial services. Read more from Andrew. Trading in China was volatile again on Friday, the first day since the suspension of the circuit breaker. The Chinese central bank also took steps to strengthen the yuan after the currency's weakness was taken as a sign of problems for the economy. Connor Campbell, an analyst at Spreadex, said the FTSE's rise on Friday was \"nothing to write home about, especially in the context of the near 6% plunge the UK index has witnessed since Monday\". However, he added, it did mark an important moment of calm that has been largely absent since 2016 got underway, something that could help matters heading into next week. Market attention now turns to the US unemployment figures, which are due out later on Friday. \"It takes quite something to relegate the US employment report to a footnote in this week's trading activity, but the China induced volatility seen over the past few days appears to have done the trick,\" said Michael Hewson from CMC Markets. \"As we come to the end of the week European equity markets look on course to post some of the worst weekly losses since the previous China induced volatility, seen last August.\" The BBC's Steve Evans in Beijing, says the reason for the volatility in China's mainland markets is that  \"there's a class of share buyer who treats it almost like the dog track\". But these investors cannot fight gravity, and an enormously expensive share market has been brought to heel, he says. Anne Richards, chief investment officer at Aberdeen Asset Management, told the BBC she was \"seeing inexperience\" in some parts of the regulation of Chinese markets. The addition of inexperienced investors did not help, she said. \"That's not a good setup... but over time it will improve.\" Dr Nikos Paltalidis, a lecturer in Finance at Durham University Business School, added the lack of experience among investors was highlighted by the fact that the first six months of 2015 saw the Chinese stock market soar by about 50%, adding that the rise in stocks was  \"disconnected from economic fundamentals\". \"Investors borrowed heavily to speculate on stocks, inflating a short-lived asset bubble. With volatility high in the Chinese markets investing in high-quality, dividend-paying stocks seem to be the safest strategy for the short-term,\" he added.",

Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said Mrs May, who was home secretary before becoming PM, had allowed officer numbers to fall in recent years. The Conservatives said Ms Abbott had \"dangerous\" views on protecting the public. Armed police numbers have increased, a Conservative spokesman added. Following the London and Manchester terror attacks, security is featuring heavily in the final days of campaigning before Thursday's general election. Labour has been targeting cuts to the Home Office's policing budget - the Conservatives have rejected the criticism and a former terrorism law watchdog said linking the cuts to terror attacks was a \"completely misleading argument\". Speaking to the BBC, Ms Abbott said it was \"concerning\" that action was not taken when one of the London attackers - 27-year-old Khuram Butt - was known to the security services. She said this reinforced the need for an increase in community police officers. Latest figures show that between September 2010 and September 2016, police workforce numbers in England and Wales fell by 18,991, or 13%. Ms Abbott said police numbers had fallen \"on Theresa May's watch\" despite warnings from the Police Federation and HM Inspector of Constabulary. \"So she should really consider how much of this goes back to her door and the decisions that she took,\" she said. Asked how much of a connection there was between Saturday's attack and the cuts to officer numbers, she added: \"She does need to explain why she thought it appropriate to watch police numbers go down by 20,000 when she had so many warnings from so many people that this was putting people at risk. \"Clearly the people responsible for these horrific terror attacks are the bloodthirsty and depraved terrorists but Theresa May has to take responsibility for letting austerity damage her ability to keep us safe.\" Speaking in a special general election edition of Question Time, Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said cuts to police numbers had \"not made us safer\". But Lord Carlile, the former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, told the BBC cuts in community policing were \"nothing to do with terrorism\", saying \"nobody in the security services is complaining about their funding\" Following the London attack, Mrs May said \"things need to change\" in the fight against terrorism, calling for more to be done about online extremism and for a review into whether security services needed extra powers. Speaking to BBC Newsbeat, she defended her record, saying she had given the police extra powers to deal with terrorists and that there had been an increase in the number of people reporting suspected extremists to the authorities. The Conservatives described Labour's criticism as \"desperate stuff\", saying the security services had been boosted with extra officers. \"Diane Abbott's views on keeping us safe are as dangerous as she is hopeless under pressure,\" a spokesman said, saying she had \"voted against every piece of security legislation designed to keep us safe\".",

A week of protests to coincide with the race began on Friday, organised by the opposition to the ruling royal family.

Ecclestone told the AFP news agency: \"There's no reason why [the race] shouldn't be [a success].\" Asked about the demonstrations, he said: \"What's happened? They're demonstrating now? I didn't know that. There's nobody demonstrating.\" The explosions in Bahrain were reported to include a gas cylinder that set a car ablaze in the financial district of the capital Manama. Ecclestone added on Tuesday: \"We don't want to see trouble. We don't want to see people arguing and fighting about things we don't understand, because we really don't understand. Some people feel it's our fault there are problems. \"Last year I spoke to the people representing the protesters and I spoke to the people we deal with. It was really difficult to decide who is right and who is wrong. \"I'm happy to talk to anybody about this, as I did before,\" he said, citing his meetings with Bahraini opposition party al-Wefaq last year in London and the Middle East.

She added that Bahrain \"will ensure appropriate security measures are taken during the F1 race and will take enough measures, as in all other countries which host such international sporting events\". The opposition and government resumed reconciliation talks in February for the first time since 2011, when protests were crushed and at least 35 people died, but little progress has been reported. Protestors have told the Reuters news agency they see an opportunity to use the race to highlight what they say are injustices still being committed against them. The 2011 Bahrain Grand Prix was postponed and later cancelled after month-long pro-democracy protests were crushed. Ecclestone said he was \"extremely sympathetic\" to the opposition in Bahrain, adding: \"Don't forget, I was the one, when we had apartheid in South Africa, who pulled the race.\" Last year's race went ahead after Ecclestone and governing body the FIA said they had been assured the kingdom was safe for F1 personnel.

Andrew Haldane said in a speech he was downbeat over the UK economy because of weaker global growth, low wage growth and financial and political risks. \"Put in rather plainer English, I am gloomier,\" Mr Haldane said. \"This implies interest rates could remain lower for longer, certainly than I had expected three months ago.\" Global markets have tumbled this week, with investors disconcerted at the lack of growth in Europe and especially Greece, the impact of Ebola, and worrying economic data from China and the US. Previously, UK interest rates had been expected to rise early next year. Mr Haldane made his remarks at a speech to local business leaders in Kenilworth, where he described the UK's economy as \"writhing in both agony and ecstasy\". He said there were still plenty of reasons to be cheerful. Growth is set to be the fastest of any major economy this year and inflation and borrowing costs are low, he said. However, he said the \"reasons to be fearful\" included productivity and wages, which had not risen. \"If there is genuine uncertainty about the path of the economy, the optimal policy response may be to avoid the worst outcomes,\" said Mr Haldane. Sterling dropped 0.5% against the dollar following his remarks. Share trading on the London market has been volatile. Mr Haldane's caution about global economic prospects were echoed by the Chancellor, George Osborne, who told the BBC that the worldwide economy was \"more unstable than it has been for some time\". Mr Osborne would not comment on Mr Haldane's remarks. But he said there were \"a lot of global risks out there at the moment\" affecting the international economy. \"Interest rates are entirely a matter for the independent Bank of England, the monetary policy committee there,\" Mr Osborne said. He added: \"I'll say this about the economy more generally - there are clearly a lot of global risks out there at the moment - we see these problems in the European economy, we've got this horrific disease Ebola in West Africa, all the problems in the Middle East and in the Ukrainian border. \"The global economy is more unstable than it has been for some time. That is all the more reason why in the UK we have to stick to the stability we have won.\" He said it was important to \"make sure Britain is well protected as we're in these stormy international economic waters\".

        "article": "It's a book that lay undiscovered for 60 years and which went on to become a phenomenon: Irene Nemirovksy's epic French novel Suite Francaise, written in the early years of the World War II, not only became a worldwide bestseller upon its publication in 2004, but is now an English language movie. The film, directed by British film-maker Saul Dibb and starring Michelle Williams and Kristin Scott Thomas, is, according to Williams, \"entirely dedicated and a tribute to Irene Nemirovsky and her descendants,\" a Jewish author from the Ukraine who settled in Paris. Despite her conversion to Roman Catholicism, she was arrested by the Nazis and died, aged 39, at Auschwitz concentration camp in 1942. \"It's quite overwhelming, the level of emotion you feel when you even think about Irene's story as it's more extraordinary than anything she wrote, even Suite Francaise,\" says the actress. \"As soon as I read the script, I could see Irene, and hear her voice around me. It very rarely happens, but her words sounded like music to me.\" Williams, the winner of a Golden Globe in 2012 for playing Marilyn Monroe in Simon Curtis's  My Week With Marilyn, adds that \"when you are dealing with the legacy of a real life person, it's a responsibility heaped on you. \"You want to be true to that person, and in this case, I wanted to be faithful to Irene. The fact that this story was very nearly never published makes it more precious.\" Williams plays the role of Lucille, a young wife in the French provincial town of Bussy, who waits for news of her husband, fighting for France, under the disapproving eye of her mother-in-law, played by Kristin Scott Thomas. She meets a young German officer and falls in love, even as the town is brutalised under occupation from its invaders. In the novel, Lucille's love affair is just one of many stories Nemirovsky weaves of life under Nazi control. But Suite Francaise, written in tiny handwriting in a notebook as paper became more scarce, was never completed. Nemirovsky was taken to Auschwitz, and her notebook was passed to her youngest daughter, Denise Epstein, who didn't open it until 2004, thinking it contained her mother's journals. Upon discovery and publication, Nemirovsky was posthumously awarded the prestigious French literary prize, the Prix Renaudot, and her other novels were also successfully republished. Expressing her sorrow that Epstein died in 2013, \"just before we made the film, and so I never got to meet her,\" Williams calls meeting the author's descendants \"the most special day of filming; they came to the set, and it was emotional for everyone\". And Scott Thomas added: \"It just really is all about the incredible story of Irene and her book, and I just hope the film has done it justice, because its publication was very important - it's a historical document for France. \"This tale of violent occupiers - this is recent history we are re-telling, from the time of our grandparents, and it has terrible poignancy for today as well, all over the world. \"I think what was interesting is that Irene had no Jewish characters in her book, or anything to say about their persecution. \"Some commentators have called her anti-Jewish as she hadn't embraced or exposed what was going on with her people at that period in France. \"However, in our film version, we have a moment where you do see what is happening to the Jewish people, and that was our own tribute to the fate of Irene.\" Director Dibb, whose previous work includes The Duchess, starring Keira Knightley, describes adding those scenes as \"a necessary piece of artistic licence\". \"Irene wrote so generously about her occupiers. The book was written in 1940, in the early stages of the war, and she doesn't even refer to them as Nazis. \"She had no perspective on what happened to her people, and what happened to France. However, she was killed by her occupiers, and killed by those French collaborators too, who helped deport their Jewish populations.\" Williams defends the choosing of just one storyline from the original novel, saying, \"the book itself is incomplete and so fragmented that it would be difficult to tell as a film unless one story is picked out. \"I'm glad they chose Lucille's love story - I think many people will identify with the story of love in hopeless circumstances. \"But what's also interesting for me is my character starts out as fragile and na\u00efve, and becomes a revolutionary. The circumstances we live in dictate who we become. \"I'm just sorry that I never got to see or hold the original manuscript of the book, and actually see Irene's writing, although I do have a first edition of the book. But I hope we have also helped her to live on.\" Suite Francaise is released in the UK on 13 March.",

        "article": "It's a sobering thought for all us carriers of the Y chromosome, but prostate cancer kills almost as many men every year as breast cancer does women. According to Cancer Research UK some 41, 000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer every year, but 10,700 will die of the disease, making it the fourth most common cause of cancer death - and second only to lung cancer in men. Given such a dire prognosis, and let's face it, given the financial profile of its victims, you might be forgiven for assuming that prostate cancer would be one of the most highly prioritised and well researched areas of oncology. Not a bit of it. Perhaps it's because men are squeamish, or don't like to talk about their health or visit the doctor, but prostate cancer has long been dubbed \"the Cinderella cancer\". \"We just don't make enough of it\" according to consultant oncologist Professor Neil Burnet. \"On the whole men are less vocal about their health, and older men tend to be even more stoical, preferring to grin and bear it. But it means men are poor advocates, and as a result prostate cancer has been overlooked\". Based at Addenbrooke's Hospital on the outskirts of Cambridge, Prof Burnet is trying to improve the targeting and efficiency of radiotherapy treatments, and to reduce toxicity in the healthy tissue surrounding the prostate. The technique, called Image Guided Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy Treatment uses imaging provided by a CT scan to target the tumour before a powerful but precisely shaped radiation dose is administered. \"What limits what we can do with radiotherapy are the side effects of the treatment, the toxicity.  And, since the prostate can move by up to a couple of centimetres from one day to the next, targeting the treatment is really important. The second half of this technology is in delivering intensity modulated radiotherapy, which allows us to match a higher dose of radiation to the shape of the tumour.\" But if Image Guided IMRT offers the prospect of better outcomes for men with advanced or aggressive prostate cancer, how much better might it be to get in at an earlier stage? That - at least in part - was the motivation behind the Collaborative Oncological Gene/Environment Study, or COGES, which has announced the discovery of 80 new genetic markers for breast, ovarian and prostate cancer. In one of the largest research projects of its kind scientists from Cambridge University and the Institute of Cancer Research in London looked at samples from more than 200,000 people - half with, and half without, cancer. The results include 23 new gene variants associated with prostate cancer and 16 with aggressive forms of the disease. Initially at least that should help with the development of a viable screening test for the disease. In the longer term it may present new targets for drug treatment and better diagnosis, and a greater understanding of the mechanisms and basic biology of prostate cancer. \"It's shocking, but we still don't have an adequate screening test for prostate cancer,\" says Ros Eeles, Professor of Oncogenetics at the Institute of Cancer Research and COGES study leader on prostate cancer. \"That's because the Prostate Specific Antigen, or PSA test, just isn't accurate enough and you'd have to treat between 12 and 48 men unnecessarily to save a single life. With this new information we could have a viable test in five to eight years\". If that still seems a long way off, surgical techniques have advanced dramatically when it comes to prostate cancer. These days consultant urologist Professor David Neal uses the DaVinci surgical robot to perform prostate surgery. Sitting at a computer console that looks like it would be more at home in an amusement arcade than an operating theatre, Prof Neal can perform a prostatectomy without ever touching his patient. And because the robotic arms of the device (which looks a little like a crab hovering over the operating table) are much thinner than the surgeon's, and the grappling and cutting tools at the sharp end are much smaller, what was once a major operation is now less invasive. As with Image Guided Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy collateral damage to surrounding healthy tissue is kept to a minimum. \"The DaVinci robot has made a huge difference to prostate surgery\" says Prof Neal. \"It's still a major operation, but we can be very precise about what we remove and the function we're able to save. That's got to be good news for the patient\".",

        "article": "A deal to save Tata Steel's Scunthorpe plant could be signed as soon as Monday, the BBC understands. The steelworks has been on the market since 2014 and the sale to UK-based investment firm Greybull Capital, would involve a \u00a3400m investment package. It would secure about 4,800 jobs and thousands more in supply chains and the local economy. Tata Steel has said it plans to sell the rest of its UK steel business, putting thousands of jobs at risk. The Scunthorpe steelworks is a key part of Tata Steel's long products division, which was put up for sale in 2014. Greybull Capital has been in talks to buy the division for nine months and entered into exclusive negotiations with Tata in December. Greybull describes itself as \"a family office which makes long-term investments in private companies\". The London-based investment firm is run by financiers Marc and Nathaniel Meyohas and Richard Perlhagen. Greybull is backing a turnaround plan, which aims to return the loss-making business to profitability within one to two years. Greybull plans to invest \u00a3400m in the business but the plan involves significant cost savings. Staff are being asked to accept a 3% pay cut for one year and reductions to company pension contributions.  Workers are being balloted on the changes. The firm has been in discussion with the government for a loan of between \u00a370m and \u00a3100m. Those discussions are thought to be continuing but it is understood the sale is not dependent upon the loan. The turnaround plan was drawn up by management at Scunthorpe with input from unions and refined by the management consultants McKinsey & Co. It is understood Greybull is not envisaging further restructuring beyond the 1,200 job losses announced last October. That involved the closure of one of the two coke ovens at Scunthorpe and the mothballing of three plate mills, reducing annual production capacity to 2.8m tonnes. Two of those Mills, in Lanarkshire in Scotland, have been sold to Liberty House, the commodities company which has expressed an interest in buying Tata's other UK steel operations, including the Port Talbot steelworks. The sale could also see the business rebranded as \"British Steel\", as it is understood Greybull is seeking to buy the brand as part of the deal. \"British Steel\" was the name of Britain's privatised steel industry.  It disappeared in 1999 when the industry was merged with a Dutch rival to create the Corus Group. The new business would include the Scunthorpe works, two mills in Teesside, an engineering workshop in Workington, a design consultancy in York and distribution facilities. About 3,400 employees are based in Scunthorpe with a further thousand spread across the other sites. The business also has a mill in northern France employing 400 workers. The business makes products for the transport and construction sectors with customers including the equipment giant Caterpillar and Network Rail. It is thought to have a 90% share of the market for new rails used across Britain's railways. The mill in northern France also produces rails for the national railway operator SNCF and for customers in Western Europe. Greybull specialises in turning around struggling firms by taking controlling stakes and backing management teams. In 2014 it rescued the holiday airline Monarch, buying a 90% stake. The airline returned to profitability the following year. Last September it bought 140 Morrisons convenience stores, rebranding them as My Local. It also owns Plessey, another name from Britain's industrial past, and is seeking to turn it into a leader in LED technology. But its purchase of Tata's loss-making long products division is its most high profile deal yet. But this sale, which could come as early as Monday, is not yet a done deal. It is expected to be subject to some outstanding conditions, thought to include financing and supplier agreements, which may mean it will not be formally completed for weeks. Greybull has made it clear that its focus at this time is on the long products purchase. You can follow John on twitter on @JohnMoylanBBC",

        "article": "An unprecedented overspend by hospitals and other NHS trusts is expected to be announced later by health bosses. The figures for England from the regulator, NHS Improvement, cover the 2015-16 year, which finished in March. By December - the three-quarter mark - hospital, ambulance and mental health trusts were already \u00a32.2bn in the red, with the figure expected to have risen. Overspending on agency staff has been highlighted as a major problem, as well as rising demand for services. Experts are warning the pressure the overspend puts hospitals under has an impact on care. Analysis: Is enough being spent by the NHS? Analysis: Mind the NHS financial black hole Financial problems 'endemic in the NHS' The figures account for about two-thirds of the entire \u00a3116bn health budget - they do not cover GPs, training budgets, public health budgets held by councils or any unspent money held by local health managers. That means the Department of Health could still balance the books when the overall accounts are released later in the summer. But the expected overspend still has the potential to impact on services. This year the NHS is getting \u00a33.8bn extra as part of the spending review settlement. Some \u00a31.8bn has already been set aside for hospitals to cover their deficits, but anything in excess of that will mean they will be under more pressure to make savings as the year goes on. A hospital trust financial director, who wishes to remain anonymous, suggested the Department of Health was \"cooking up accounting alchemy\" by \"turning hospitals' very large aggregated deficits into a much lower figure to ensure the NHS meets the spending limit set by HM Treasury\". He told the BBC that examples included shifting the recording of investment spending into day-to-day running costs. He said: \"The so-called capital to revenue transfer may well be a legitimate accounting adjustment at the margins of the NHS accounts. \"But I have grave concerns that it is being used on a scale of hundreds of millions of pounds in more than 80 trusts. The cash is being washed through hospitals' accounts as 'income' merely to improve the bottom line.\" A Department of Health spokesman said: \"We are committed to the NHS and are investing \u00a310bn in its own plan for the future - but it is vital that money is accounted for consistently. \"The transfer from capital to revenue makes no difference to the overall departmental picture given Parliament has voted to approve it - to say otherwise is misleading.\" He also pointed out that the final accounts will be reviewed by the National Audit Office.\u200e \"We recognise parts of the NHS are under pressure as demand rises due to our ageing population, but we are providing intensive support to improve performance, boost efficiency and reduce the use of expensive agency staff.\" Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents NHS trusts, said concerns over accounting practices were a symptom of unprecedented demand on the NHS. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"There's no doubt that the pressure this year is much greater than it has ever been, and that therefore each individual finance director and each individual board is having to make a decision about what they believe is appropriate.\" But he added that the practices were \"a perfectly ordinary thing to do\". David Bennett, a former chief executive of Monitor, the regulator of the NHS in England which is now part of NHS Improvement, said the Department of Health had to find a way of funding the deficit. \"For certain, they will be scrambling around trying to find every little budget elsewhere that has underspent to try and make sure the numbers all add up\". Hospitals and other health services are not like businesses. They're not going to just go bust, as the government can always step in. But the financial problems do matter. The deficits being racked up are massive. You probably have to go back to a very different era - the early 1950s - to find a similar scale of overspending, and that led to charges being brought in for spectacles, dentistry and prescriptions. This time the impact is likely to be felt in terms of what doesn't happen. The Department of Health has made it clear the overspends will not be simply written off. Instead, hospitals (most of the overspends are concentrated among them) will have to use the extra money they have got this year to pay off their debts. If that happens on a large scale, it puts the NHS on a back foot. Recruitment freezes are introduced, building projects are stopped or delayed and services are scaled back. These measures are already being taken, but more of them will just make it more difficult for the NHS to meet its waiting time targets and provide high-quality care. Read more from Nick Follow Nick on Twitter Anita Charlesworth, of the Health Foundation think-tank, said the mood in the NHS \"could not be bleaker\". \"The level of deficits in terms of scale and how many hospitals are in deficit is unprecedented. It puts organisations under stress, which makes them fragile and risky. \"There is pressure on recruitment, pressure on management and that has an impact on services. We are already seeing waiting time targets being breached.\" She also said capital budgets - money which has been set aside for building projects and maintenance - were being raided. When the three-quarter year figures were released, just seven of the 138 hospital trusts were in surplus. Last year NHS trusts finished over \u00a3800m in the red - with the health service as a whole balancing the books only after a cash injection from the Treasury and by raiding the capital budget. The rest of the UK does not release equivalent figures as hospitals are not run as autonomous organisations as they are in England. It means the accounts cover a wider range of services and therefore may take into account surpluses in other areas of the health service. Figures in Scotland have yet to be published. Meanwhile, ministers in Wales have predicted the NHS will break even. No data is available for Northern Ireland.",

The Universities and Colleges Employers Association (UCEA), which represents the universities as employers, has expressed disappointment at the rejection of the offer. A spokesman for UCEA said that less than 5% of the higher education workforce had chosen to vote in favour of strike action and predicted \"a low level impact on students\".

        "article": "A large police presence held back angry crowds outside a Kensington church where Theresa May was meeting victims of the Grenfell Tower disaster. The prime minister faced cries of \"coward\" and \"shame on you\". One woman wept, saying it was because the PM declined to speak to anyone outside the meeting which lasted less than hour. Mrs May pledged \u00a35m of support, housing guarantees and help with access to bank accounts and cash. \"The package of support I'm announcing today is to give the victims the immediate support they need to care for themselves and for loved ones. We will continue to look at what more needs to be done,\" Mrs May said in a statement issued by her office. Dozens of demonstrators surged towards the entrance of St Clement's church and there were scuffles outside as organisers appealed for calm. Earlier on Friday, the prime minister spent almost an hour speaking to patients and staff at London's Chelsea and Westminster Hospital. It came a day after she faced criticism for meeting firefighters but not residents at the scene of the blaze. She also chaired the government's Civil Contingencies Committee, which deals with major crises such as terrorism or natural disasters, in Whitehall. But local people have contrasted the style of Mrs May's private visit to the scene with those of London Mayor Sadiq Khan and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who was seen with his arm around the shoulders of people affected by the disaster. Also on Friday, the Queen and the Duke of Cambridge met volunteers, local residents and community representatives while visiting Westway Sports Centre, near the tower block in north Kensington. During interview with the BBC, Mrs May sidestepped questions over her response to the disaster. Pressed on whether she had failed to understand the anger felt by the community, she said: \"This was a terrible tragedy that took place. People have lost their lives and others have lost everything, all their possessions, their home and everything. \"What we are doing is putting in place the support that will help them.\" She said she had worked to ensure public services had the support they needed in order to be able to deal with the immediate aftermath. Conservative former Cabinet minister Michael Portillo said Mrs May should have been prepared to face residents' anger. He told BBC's This Week: \"Alas Mrs May was what she has been for the last five or six weeks, that is to say she wanted an entirely controlled situation in which she didn't use her humanity. \"She met in private with the emergency services, a good thing to do no doubt, but she should have been there with the residents, which is what Jeremy Corbyn was.\" But Commons leader Andrea Leadsom, who also faced some anger when she visited a community centre in the area on Friday, insisted that Mrs May was \"absolutely heartbroken\" by the blaze and was simply trying to make sure the government did everything it could to deal with its aftermath. Mrs Leadsom said: \"In reality, every single member of the House of Commons, every member of the government from the prime minister downwards are absolutely horrified by what's happened and we are all trying to do the best we can. \"I don't really think it is appropriate to be talking about whether people have humanity or not.\" As she spoke to Sky News at the site in west London, she was confronted by a local resident, who said opportunities had been missed to make the 24-storey block safe following a report into the 2009 Lakanal House fire in Camberwell, south London. \"Why are Sadiq Khan and Corbyn coming down here to speak to people and Theresa May is coming here with police, walking around, not meeting no-one, not meeting families?\" the man said. \"This fire could have been stopped a long, long time ago... There's not even sprinklers in there. \"In 2009, the last block was on fire. What has changed since then? Nothing. Enough is enough, I have got friends in that tower. I have a right to be angry. Because of people saving money, people are dying.\" Former Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman said it was \"not OK\" for the prime minister to go to the area but not meet residents, and called on her to invite them to talk to her in Downing Street, as victims of the 2009 Lakanal House fire had been. But on the BBC's Question Time programme on Thursday, Conservative defence minister Tobias Ellwood said there were \"security reasons\" why Mrs May had not met residents. And former housing minister Mark Prisk said Mrs May would not have wanted \"to bring the whole weight of the media circus down on families who are going through some pretty grim days\". But BBC royal correspondent Peter Hunt said there would be questions about why the Queen was able to make such a visit, and the prime minister was not. Downing Street said that Mrs May's visit on Thursday had been made to get a briefing from the emergency services to ensure that they had the resources they needed. On Friday, Mrs May visited the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital which is treating eight people, three of whom are in critical care. Communities Secretary Sajid Javid told the BBC on Friday there would be immediate action following early conclusions from an investigative report into the fire. \"We need to do whatever it takes to make people that live in those properties safe: that's either make the properties safe or find some other accommodation, it has to be done,\" Mr Javid told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \"In this country, in this century, for this kind of thing to happen it is horrific and we cannot allow anything like this to ever happen again.\" Councils say they are carrying out urgent reviews of high-rise buildings in their areas in the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower fire.

Mr Obama declined to comment on Mr Trump's pick of controversial conservative figure Steve Bannon as his White House chief strategist.

Trump and Putin 'to mend ties' Kremlin says Trump presidency: Your questions answered \"I did say to him, as I've said publicly, that because of the nature of the campaign and the bitterness and ferocity of the campaigns, it's really important to try to send some signals of unity, and to reach out to minority groups or women or others that were concerned about the tenor of the campaign.\" Mr Obama said of their Oval Office meeting: \"We had a very cordial conversation. Do I have concerns? Absolutely.\" It was only a week ago that the nation's first black president was describing Mr Trump as \"woefully unprepared for the job\".

        "article": "James Anderson has ridiculed comments made by Geoffrey Boycott about the batting of England's World Cup captain Eoin Morgan. Former England batsman Boycott said Morgan was not \"as good as he thinks he is\" and \"not so clever\" against top-class bowling. But pace bowler Anderson responded: \"That's rich coming from him. Media playback is not supported on this device \"Morgan is a world-class player and has been for over 100 games. We know how destructive he is when he's in form.\" Boycott, who scored 1,082 runs in 34 one-day innings for England, at an average of 36.06, was passing judgement on a poor sequence of form that has seen Morgan dismissed for less than 20 in nine of his last 11 one-day international innings. Anderson, though, defended his captain, saying: \"He has been great for us. We're hopeful he can get some form. We've seen him get a hundred on this trip against Australia.\" The 32-year-old was speaking before England's opening World Cup game against co-hosts Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Saturday (03:30 GMT). Former England captain Michael Vaughan said Morgan had never claimed to be \"the greatest\", but disagreed with Boycott's comments. \"I think he can have his opinion,\" said Vaughan. \"I work with him, respect him a lot, I like him, but I disagree with what he's said about Eoin Morgan. \"He needs runs, but in the past Morgan has had the kind of mentality to produce on the big stage.\" More than 90,000 spectators are expected to be in attendance as England look to improve on a run that has seen them lose 13 of their last 15 ODIs against Australia down under. \"It's obviously a big game for both sides,\" said Anderson, who has taken 264 wickets in 188 matches since making his debut at the MCG in 2002. \"As a cricketer, you want to play in big games like this. We're guessing that the majority of the crowd will be against us, so it's something we're prepared for. It's something that we have to try to soak up and enjoy. \"We feel confident that we can beat anyone on our day. Confidence is building in our team and we're hoping that we can put things together when it really matters.\" With Australia captain Michael Clarke ruled out of Saturday's opener because of injury, George Bailey has been confirmed as his replacement. However, Bailey admitted that he was likely to lose his place in the team when Clarke returns for the second match against Bangladesh. The 32-year-year-old batsman also said that Australia should enjoy the extra support they receive as co-hosts, rather than feel the pressure of being favourites to win the tournament. \"I don't think I'll keep my place, but that's fine,\" said Bailey. \"I think it's great that Michael is on track to come back, he's done a remarkable job to be available for the Bangladesh game. \"I'm not feeling the pressure of expectation. We get to enjoy some home comforts and home support. We should embrace the opportunity of a home World Cup. \"There have been some amazing Australian players who have never had the chance of a home World Cup. You can view that as pressure, or view it as a wonderful opportunity.\" With so much of the conversation in Australia surrounding the fitness of Clarke, former leg-spinner Shane Warne had his say on the process the captain has had to get through since injuring his right hamstring on 13 December. \"Some of the stuff I've been reading about Michael Clarke, you'd think he was 45. He's only 33,\" said Warne, who is 45 himself. \"They've tried to break him with all the fitness stuff, but he's ready to go, fitter than he's ever been in five years. I would have picked him.\" Warne, a World Cup winner in 1999, also said England were capable of shocking Australia on Saturday and identified Ravi Bopara - whose place may be under threat - as one of the key men. \"England need James Anderson, Stuart Broad, Ian Bell, Eoin Morgan and Ravi Bopara to fire. If a few of those guys have a day out at the World Cup, they could go all the way.\" In an attempt to ramp up the tension and create a partisan atmosphere before the Australia-England match, a betting company has placed posters around Melbourne that read \"Missing: pair of balls. If found please return to the England cricket team\". On Friday, they took it one stage further, draping banners from two helicopters that circled the city, flying over the MCG just as England were training. If England were unimpressed, so too was Bailey, who sarcastically said the banners were \"very witty\".",

        "article": "England's victory in the third Test against South Africa in Johannesburg was quite remarkable. They began the third day 75 runs behind with five first-innings wickets in hand. For them to win on the same evening is not quite unprecedented, but certainly highly unusual, especially in the age of covered pitches. At lunchtime, South Africa were basically level with all 10 wickets intact. It was their opportunity to bat England out of the game. Instead, less than two sessions later, they were beaten. It was incredible. The catalyst for it all was Stuart Broad. As soon as he starts lifting those knees up and running in hard, batsmen are in trouble. Media playback is not supported on this device His 5-1 in 31 balls is the seventh time he has taken five wickets in a single spell of bowling. Those are match-winning performances. He was helped by conditions - the clouds hung around, the floodlights were on all day, the new ball was venomous and brutal. But the bowler still has to put the ball in the right place and, in those circumstances, Broad is a formidable man to face. It wasn't just the deliveries that took wickets that were dangerous - some were flying past the nose, others were crashing into flesh. South Africa will not only be suffering the pain of defeat, but also the bruises of leather on skin. These spells that Broad bowls - The Oval in 2009, Chester-le-Street in 2013, Trent Bridge in 2015 and now here - are symptomatic of his character. If your team is in a situation where someone needs to stand up and be counted, then Broad wants to be that man. He uses all of his 6ft 6in to get bounce, but also swings and seams the ball as well. He's accurate, so builds pressure. On top of that, he loves to get in your face and under your skin. Broad, though, is just one of the players capable of turning a Test for England. In fact, I'm willing to stick my neck out and say that it is unusual for England to be blessed with so many match-winners. Broad, Ben Stokes and Joe Root can all turn the momentum in a session. We know what a fully fit James Anderson is capable of and Steven Finn showed during the Ashes that he can bowl a magic spell. This ability to turn a Test from a position of peril began for England back in the summer. On the first morning against New Zealand at Lord's, England found themselves 30-4, only for Root and Stokes to counter-attack. For years, England had it done to them - think of the havoc that Australia's Adam Gilchrist used to cause. Now, England are doing it to other teams with a great deal of flair and courage. They are a team on the up and one I fancied to beat South Africa, who, in contrast, are a team in decline. The Proteas may have started the series ranked number one, but we knew they were no longer the world's outstanding team. Yes, they have been deprived of Dale Steyn and Vernon Philander - and it is a shame that England did not have the chance to beat a full-strength South Africa - but that might not have made a difference. South Africa simply did not have the chance to get over their humbling in India and therefore carried the scars into this series. England had the opportunity to draw a line under their defeat against Pakistan in the UAE, a series where they far from disgraced themselves. Looking ahead, England have two home series in the summer that they should win. The last time Sri Lanka were in England, they won, so Alastair Cook has a score to settle there and some ranking points to win back. You never know which Pakistan will turn up, but England will again be favourites. They then go to Bangladesh, which will be good preparation for a formidable trip to India, the new world number ones. Then again, England won the last time they were there too. These things go in cycles and, in English cricket, we tend to look forward to the Ashes as a marker and a time to be judged. The next date with Australia is at the end of 2017, down under. Almost two years out, England look well-placed. Jonathan Agnew was talking to BBC Sport's Stephan Shemilt",

Mark Thompson wrote in a blog that the BBC had seen \"disturbing new tactics\", including the targeting of family members of those working outside Iran. Last week, the sister of a BBC Persian staff member was detained and held in solitary confinement at a Tehran jail. Iran accused the BBC of inciting unrest after the disputed re-election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in 2009. BBC Persian broadcast online videos and interviewed protesters, who described deaths, injuries and arbitrary arrests carried out by security forces. In his blog, Mr Thompson wrote that for BBC Persian staff, \"interference and harassment from the Iranian authorities has become a challenging fact of life\". \"In recent months, we have witnessed increased levels of intimidation alongside disturbing new tactics,\" he added. \"This includes an attempt to put pressure on those who work for BBC Persian outside Iran, by targeting family members who still live inside the country.\" Mr Thompson revealed that last week the sister of a BBC Persian member of staff was arrested and held in solitary confinement on unspecified charges at Evin Prison in the capital, Tehran. \"Although she has now been released on bail, her treatment was utterly deplorable and we condemn it in the strongest possible terms.\" Human Rights Watch said that at one point, a man claiming to be the relative's interrogator at Evin telephoned the staff member in London and offered to release her in return for information about the BBC. Mr Thompson said staff had also faced false accusations of sexual assault, drug trafficking and financial crimes. In recent months, a number of relatives of BBC Persian staff had been detained for short periods of time by the Iranian authorities and urged to get their relatives in London to either stop working for the BBC, or to \"co-operate\" with Iranian intelligence officials, Mr Thompson said. In other instances, passports of family members have been confiscated, preventing them from leaving Iran, he added. \"This has left many BBC Persian staff too afraid to return to the country, even to visit sick or elderly relatives.\" He said some had also had their Facebook and email accounts hacked, and been subjected to a \"consistent stream of false and slanderous accusations... in the official Iranian media, ranging from allegations of serious sexual assault, drug trafficking, and criminal financial behaviour\". Some reports claimed they had converted from Islam to Christianity or Bahai faith - potentially a capital offence in Iran as it is considered to be apostasy. Human Rights Watch's Middle East director, Sarah Leah Whitson, said the actions of the Iranian authorities suggested they were attempting to silence reporters and the BBC, and were sending \"a message that the government's long arm of repression can extend well beyond borders\". UK Middle East Minister Alistair Burt said Iranian officials' \"deplorable tactics illustrate again the deteriorating human rights situation in Iran, and the desperation of the Iranian regime to silence any independent voices\".",

Former Celtic and Republic of Ireland goalkeeper Pat Bonner assesses the victors' performance in Sunday's Scottish League Cup final, while former Aberdeen and Scotland defender Willie Miller gives his marks out of 10 for Derek McInnes' side. Didn't do too much wrong, couldn't do anything about the goals. Not over-worked, but Celtic had a number of other chances. Not the worst. In second-half, he came more to life in terms of getting forward, which is a big part of his game. In team for his height and domination but didn't dominate his opponent or take responsibility for closing gap between defence and midfield. Use of the ball was poor. Probably his poorest performance for Aberdeen - uncertain, played too deep. He didn't close down James Forrest quickly enough for the second goal and conceded the penalty for the third. Must be disappointed, because he's looked good since coming to the club Wasn't exposed on too many occasions against Patrick Roberts. Did have the chance with a header and maybe should have done better with it. Moved to centre-back later, his preferred his position. Didn't play to the standard he's capable of. Not the worst in midfield. Tried hard but played in an area that was dominated by Celtic. Only got close to Celtic's midfielders on a couple of occasions and should have made it more difficult for them. An opportunity as captain to lift the trophy. He normally gives you an element of control in midfield but didn't do that. The gap between him and his defence was too wide, allowing Roberts, Rogic and Forrest to get in behind. Largely anonymous in the first-half. Spent his time worrying about defensive duties rather than what he's good at. Turned it around in second half and had a number of good runs, but he's a match winner and he didn't show what he was capable of. Celtic dominated in midfield and McLean must take responsibility. He's been at the club long enough to know what's expected, should be performing to a high level and on the big stage. If you want to be an international, you have to perform better. Whenever he got on the ball, you felt, if anything was going to happen creatively, it was going to come through him. He was taken out the game on two or three occasions and Celtic players realised he was the main threat. Not the Adam Rooney I know. Didn't do much in terms of causing a threat to the two centre-backs, who handled him extremely well. He needed to work harder to make it difficult for them but had little support. Should be a goal threat but didn't do that. Won a couple of headers, but his timing was out at times after coming on for O'Connor. Expect more from a player like him. With Hayes, who he replaced, he's the quality in terms of creativity and didn't create anything. Barely touched the ball after taking over from Rooney. Hard when coming on at 3-0 down. Had that save from Andrew Considine's first-half header but didn't have much else to do. To force his way back into the side and win a medal, you have to give him great credit. Fairly comfortable at right-back, as steady as always, and was in control defensively. Was probably the pick of the back four. Stepping out, he made the opening goal. Passed the ball well throughout. Strong, powerful figure at the back. Was never put under significant pressure. Attacked the by-line as always and delivered an early cross for Moussa Dembele to head on target. Man of the match, dominated proceedings, looked in control and showed flair at times. Won a tackle with O'Connor that probably put paid to the defender for the next five or 10 minutes. Led by example. Solid display, worked very hard, not over-spectacular and should have scored at the end after getting himself into a great position. Always capable of doing something in the game. An attacking threat throughout. He plays the position well and scored the opening goal. Scored Celtic's second goal, laid on a couple, won the penalty for the third. I asked the question before, could he step up? And I think he did. Probably Celtic's quietest player. Wasn't involved as much as he would have wanted to be. Probably the quietest we've seen him but still scored his goal. Not as sharp as he normally is but led the line well. Did what he had do after coming on for Roberts. Kept it nice and solid in midfield. Another who did his job well and kept the performance ticking over after coming on for Rogic. Didn't have much time to impress as a late sub for Forrest but didn't do anything wrong. Pat Bonner and Willie Miller were talking to BBC Scotland's Richard Wilson.",

        "article": "One of the first things many of us notice when we meet someone is what sort of perfume or aftershave they're wearing. That was certainly the case when I met up with my friend Kerrie the other week and asked why she smelled of bliss on toast. \"Midnight Fantasy by Britney Spears,\" she replied. Now, I obviously appreciate Britney as pop royalty, but I was surprised such an arresting scent would have a celebrity's name attached to it. Not long ago, fragrances were associated with well-established, fashionable names such as Ralph Lauren or couture brands like Chanel. But the number of celebrity perfumes on the market has rocketed in the last decade. Why? Jennifer Lopez. \"Glow changed everything,\" says Chandler Burr, the former scent critic for the New York Times and author of several books on the subject. He credits Lopez's first fragrance, which was released in 2002, with triggering a deluge of deodorants. \"Elizabeth Taylor was one of the first [to have her own scent], but Glow kicked the whole thing into overdrive,\" he says. Lopez had sparked what Jezebel brilliantly described as the \"scentocalpyse\". Suddenly, everyone and their goldfish had a scent of their own. And they sold by the truckload. \"Brands can see a huge surge in sales and awareness when a celebrity face resonates with their audience,\" says Gill Smith, managing director of The Perfume Shop. She cites Beyonce and Ariana Grande's ranges as some of the store's most popular products. So, what is the appeal of celebrity fragrances? \"Identification and intimacy,\" says Burr. \"Scent is an affordable unit of a star. Assuming the celebrity has actually been involved in its creation, a scent constitutes identification with that star viscerally and intimately. It is, in a small way, meeting them.\" Perfumes ideally have to match the celebrity's image while also appealing to their core audience (which explains why pop stars with younger fanbases have fragrances with sugary sweet smells). Smith says: \"We all still aspire to be more like our idols and connecting through a fragrance is one way of doing that. \"Britney Spears has stood the test of time. Diehard fans who wore Britney Fantasy over 12 years ago are still coming to us to try her new fragrances.\" This is probably a good moment for me to make a confession. And, before I start, it's not something I'm proud of, ok? It was August 2014. I'd been to Spain on holiday and was in the duty free section of Barcelona Airport. Early, bored and trying to get rid of the last of my euros, I was spraying various aftershaves up and down my arm when one caught my nose. I looked at the bottle and was surprised to see it was something called The Secret by Antonio Banderas. So I bought it, and was duly mocked by my friends for having spent money on something called The Secret by Antonio Banderas. But it did make me realise that, if something smells good, it will sell regardless. For celebrities who don't want to release a fragrance under their own name, the mere act of endorsing an existing brand can have a huge impact. \"Johnny Depp as the face of Dior Sauvage has helped to drive awareness for that fragrance,\" Smith says. \"Eighteen months after launch it's still one of our top 10 sales every day. \"Other examples include Gigi Hadid with Tommy Girl; Jared Leto with Gucci; and Estee Lauder Modern Muse with Kendall Jenner.\" She adds: \"More recently the announcement of Guerlain working with Angelina Jolie has given a more traditional fragrance house a celebrity boost.\" The stigma around celebrity fragrances may have faded over the last few years - but now the sales are fading as well. It's a decline that started several years ago in the US. \"We saw it in 2008 right after the crash, and it's now a given in the US industry that the celebrity market has collapsed - or at least hugely shrunk,\" Burr explains. \"Rihanna and a few others have scents that are doing well, but it's nothing like before.\" Consumers in the UK appear to be turning their noses up at them too. Figures released by market research group National Purchase Diary (NPD) show sales of celebrity fragrances declined by \u00a312m in the UK last year - a drop of 22%. But the fragrance market as a whole actually grew by 1.4% - so it's not that people stopped buying perfume, just that they're less drawn to celebrities. Just look at the sales of couture brands like Prada, Chanel and Dior, which collectively saw a 6% increase last year. \"The decline in celebrity perfumes is something we noticed in the past two years - it's not something we see normally,\" says Teresa Fisher, senior account manager in UK Beauty at NPD. That drop, she points out, could partly be down to fewer launches. \"The market was very healthy a few years ago because there were a lot of celebrity fragrances around,\" Fisher says. \"We saw One Direction and James Bond scents generate market growth, but now we aren't seeing as many celebrity launches.\" There might be fewer celebrities cologne-ising the shelves (sorry), but Smith says the market is still strong. \"It's definitely not the end of celebrity fragrance, we do still believe there is a place in the market for them,\" she says. \"Customers still want celebrity perfumes as long as it is the right celebrity, and the right scent.\" The right scent, of course, is the crucial part. When he was the NYT's scent critic, Burr famously awarded Britney's Midnight Fantasy four stars, implying there should be no snobbery about celebrities if the smell itself is good. He cites Sarah Jessica Parker's Lovely as one of the best of the celebrity fragrances he came across and is now even developing his own, called You or Someone Like You. Fisher says: \"I think overall what we're seeing is the polarisation of the fragrance market. \"At one end, consumers look for value for money, they go for promotions and maybe celebrity fragrances. But at the other, consumers are becoming more selective. \"Rather than buying 10 times a year maybe they buy five times a year. They're spending the same amount of money but going towards a more niche or premium offering.\" The fragrance industry was worth \u00a31.25bn in the UK last year, and shows no signs of slowing any time soon. But if the current sales trends continue, there could well be far fewer famous faces plastered across perfumes in the future.

They need to do a programme, for example, on where they are now.\" Earlier this year, BBC Two broadcast a spin-off programme from Dragons' Den, Pitches to Riches, which charted the trajectory of several business ideas the so-called Dragons had invested in. Lord Sugar added that the success of previous Apprentice winners was \"what motivates me to carry on doing [the show]\". \"They're doing very well, and they don't get enough publicity. The BBC doesn't get enough publicity over the purpose of this programme. \"I enjoy watching these young people grow a business from scratch really, and that's why I get a great buzz out of it.\" \"Ricky Martin [2012 series winner] has got about 25 people working for him, Tom [Pellereau, 2011 winner] has eight or nine working for him, Leah [Totton, 2013 winner] has got two clinics now.\" He added: \"They are one of the reasons why the candidates flock to the auditions because they want to be them.\" Not every previous contestant on the show has gone on to success in the business world, however. One of the most high-profile former candidates is Katie Hopkins - who is now a newspaper columnist and radio presenter, well-known for her controversial opinions \"You get a few people that are picked up by the media because of their outlandish comments, and they go and pursue a separate career,\" Lord Sugar said. \"Lots of them have tried. Katie Hopkins has found herself a special niche in the market. She's a bit like Piers Morgan on steroids, and of course the media lap it up. And the more controversial she wants to be, the more they lap it up.\" Claude Littner and Karren Brady have returned to assist Lord Sugar on the new series of The Apprentice, which begins on 6 October on BBC One. The businessman said the show's tasks had been updated for 2016. \"One of the things I love about this process is, as I'm getting older, I've got a great production team that keep me on my toes as far as technology is concerned. \"With a lot of the tasks some of the stuff we're going to be doing didn't exist 12 years ago. For example, there's a virtual reality episode in there.\" Lord Sugar said he believes \"the freshness of the contestants\" keeps the show relevant, adding: \"One of them was 11 years old when The Apprentice first started and has watched it since then and here they are, turning up to be one of the contestants in the show.\" \"We have a new audience growing every year, and that's the excitement of the programme.\" Lord Sugar was speaking hours after Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump took part in a televised debate with the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. From 2004 until last year, Trump appeared as the figurehead of the US version of The Apprentice - the position Lord Sugar holds on the UK show. Asked for his thoughts on his former US counterpart, Lord Sugar said: \"Well he's not as good as me, as far as The Apprentice is concerned. He's not in my class, quite frankly. \"I saw the debate with him and Hillary Clinton and what comes to mind is that it's like a US version of Would I Lie To You? \"As many people have said it is quite a frightening thought that he may be the most powerful man in the world shortly.\" Karren Brady added: \"For me personally, I think Hillary Clinton, another woman leader across the world, means the world is a safer and better place.\" Lord Sugar also did not shy away from talking about UK politics, commenting that the outcome of the EU Referendum in June made him \"fear for our country\". Referring to the vote to leave the EU, Lord Sugar said: \"I was very clear in my views, I think they've made a fatal mistake.\" \"Lots of people are saying nothing has changed. Well, exactly. Nothing has changed because we haven't even started [the process of leaving] yet.\" Lord Sugar, previously known as Sir Alan Sugar, became a peer in 2009, while Karren Brady became Baroness Brady in 2014. So would Claude Littner like to be in line for a knighthood of his own in the future? \"To be honest it crosses my mind all the time,\" he joked, \"but no-one has actually made me the offer\".

        "article": "The UK's leading eating disorder charity has called for the sale of laxatives to children to be more strictly regulated. Beat estimates 80% of those affected by eating disorders in the UK have misused laxatives in order to lose weight. It says supermarkets have done nothing to restrict sales of the medicine to young people. UK supermarkets say their sale of laxatives complies with regulation set by the medicines regulator, the MHRA. Beat says eating disorders most commonly develop during adolescence. Teens are turning to stimulant laxatives believing they can quickly lose weight, with some children known to be taking dozens of laxative pills on a daily basis, they say. Medical professionals warn that laxative abuse can cause diarrhoea, dehydration and electrolyte imbalances that can lead to kidney failure. It can also damage the liver and potentially damage the heart leading to heart failure and death. Beat wants supermarkets and retailers to reduce the ease with which young people can buy laxatives in large quantities. The charity is calling for a minimum purchase age of 16, the maximum pack size reduced to ten tablets, sales restricted to pharmacies and a warning label on packets that states \"this is not a weight loss product\". The Dulcolax and Senokot tablets currently have age restrictions on the packets. Dulcolax states that the dosage instructions are for adults and children over 10, and children under 10 should consult a doctor before taking them. The Senokot packet advises the dosage instructions are for adults and children over twelve, and that children 6 years and older should consult a doctor before taking them. They do not recommend the drug for children under 6. Both and Dulcolax and Senokot say that they treat the issue of eating disorders very seriously and say they fully comply with all the legal requirements made by MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency). \"We've seen a 30% increase in calls to our help lines over the last year where people have mentioned overusing laxatives in unhealthy way,\" Susan Ringwood, chief executive of Beat, told BBC Watchdog. \"And that does include a significant number of young people as well,\" she added. Lottie Hall is 17 years old. She started taking stimulant laxatives to help her lose weight when she was 13 and now has long term damage from laxative abuse. \"At first it would start with just a few, 4 or 5. Over time my body just got used to it and in the end I could be taking 20 to 30 a day to get them to have the desired effect. \"It was a long time, probably about 3 years before my parents found out and I started getting help for it. \"They'll be times where I'm out and all of a sudden it gets really uncomfortable and I have no control over it. \"I was a school once and I was in the corridor and was crouching down and holding my stomach in agony and my friend found me and she asked me what was wrong and I had to tell her and it was a really embarrassing situation. \"She actually had to tell my teacher and my teacher had to tell my mum.\" In 2009 Beat warned Tesco, Sainsbury's, Morrisons and Asda that children were buying the medicine in large quantities. But the charity says nothing was done. National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) says that 1.6 million people in the UK are affected by an eating disorder and according to research from Beat, 80% of those surveyed by the charity admitted that they had misused laxatives in order to lose weight. Dr Babu Vadamalayan, a paediatrician and gastroenterologist at Kings and St Thomas Hospital, told BBC Watchdog that the eating disorder unit at Maudsley Hospital say they see 140 under 18s with eating disorders every year and 10-15% of them are abusing laxatives. As part of an investigation, BBC Watchdog sent four 14-year-old actors into 25 branches of Tesco, Sainsbury's, Morrisons, Asda and Boots stores to purchase three boxes of stimulant laxatives. The actors were not stopped or questioned by staff in any of the stores, despite buying a minimum of 60 tablets in each store. MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency) recognise the concern. The body says it has consulted independent experts and believes that restricting the sale of laxatives or reducing pack sizes would not be appropriate. However, it adds that it is working with manufacturers to get stronger warnings printed on products and will monitor their safety and take further action if necessary. Boots and the four supermarkets said that they fully comply with current government and MHRA regulations on selling laxatives. Sainsbury's and Boots added that they are retraining their staff to better identify signs of laxative misuse. You can see the full report on BBC Watchdog at 20:00 BST on Thursday 16 October.",

        "article": "Rupert Murdoch \"is not a fit person to exercise the stewardship of a major international company\", MPs have said. The culture committee questioned journalists and bosses at the now-closed News of the World, as well as police and lawyers for hacking victims. Its report has concluded  that Mr Murdoch exhibited \"wilful blindness\" to what was going on in News Corporation. But the committee was split six to four with Tory members refusing to endorse the report and branding it \"partisan\". Conservative Louise Mensch called it \"a real great shame\" that the report's credibility had potentially been \"damaged\" as a result, with the report carried by Labour and Lib Dem members backing it. News Corp said in a statement it was \"carefully reviewing\" the report and would \"respond shortly\", adding: \"The company fully acknowledges significant wrongdoing at News of the World and apologises to everyone whose privacy was invaded.\" The committee itself does not have the power to impose sanctions, but it raised the possibility of a vote in the House of Commons about whether witnesses had been in contempt of Parliament - and if so, whether those witnesses should be forced to apologise in Parliament. By Robert PestonBusiness editor The BBC News Channel's chief political correspondent Norman Smith said the report was much more damning than had been anticipated and directly questioned the integrity and honesty of Rupert Murdoch. BBC business editor Robert Peston said it would push Ofcom, the media regulator, closer to the conclusion that BSkyB - 39% owned by News Corp - is not fit and proper to hold a broadcasting licence. Reacting to the report, an Ofcom spokesman said it was \"continuing to assess the evidence - including the new and emerging evidence\" that may assist it in ruling on that issue. The committee of MPs began its inquiry in July 2011 in the wake of fresh revelations about the extent of hacking at the tabloid newspaper, with reported victims including the murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler and the families of victims of the 7/7 London bombings. It heard evidence from Mr Murdoch and his son James, and has now concluded that the notion that a hands-on proprietor like Rupert Murdoch had \"no inkling\" that wrongdoing was widespread at the News of the World was \"simply not credible\". It noted that the newspaper mogul had \"excellent powers of recall and grasp of detail when it suited him\", and added: \"On the basis of the facts and evidence before the committee, we conclude that, if at all relevant times Rupert Murdoch did not take steps to become fully informed about phone hacking, he turned a blind eye and exhibited wilful blindness to what was going on in his companies and publications.\" Tory MPs objected specifically to the line branding Mr Murdoch \"not fit\", with one, Philip Davies, telling a press conference the committee had seen \"absolutely no evidence\" to endorse such a \"completely ludicrous\" conclusion. But Labour MP Tom Watson said \"more than any individual alive\", Mr Murdoch was to blame for phone hacking, and it was right to \"raise the bar\" of the report and make that clear. The committee also criticised three former News International executives - one-time executive chairman Les Hinton, former News of the World editor Colin Myler and former legal manager Tom Crone - accusing them of giving misleading evidence. Mr Myler, who is now editor of the New York Daily News, said he had \"always sought to be accurate and consistent\" when speaking to the committee and stood by his evidence. Mr Hinton said the allegations against him were \"unfounded, unfair and erroneous\". Mr Crone said he accepted there were \"valid criticisms of my conduct in this matter\", but he was \"the subject of serious allegations which lack foundation\". News Corp as a whole was guilty of \"huge failings of corporate governance\" and, throughout, its instinct had been \"to cover up rather than seek out wrongdoing and discipline the perpetrators\", the committee said. And it concluded: \"Corporately, the News of the World and News International misled the committee about the true nature and extent of the internal investigations they professed to have carried out in relation to phone hacking; by making statements they would have known were not fully truthful; and by failing to disclose documents which would have helped expose the truth.\" James Murdoch told the committee last summer that he did not see an email which suggested that hacking was more widespread at the paper than previously acknowledged - a claim disputed by Mr Myler and Mr Crone in their evidence. On that matter, the report concluded that James Murdoch was \"consistent\" in relation to the so-called \"For Neville\" email, but he had demonstrated \"wilful ignorance\" about what had been going on, which \"clearly raises questions of competence\" on his part. James Murdoch has insisted he did not know about any wrongdoing at the News of the World, but took \"his share\" of responsibility for not uncovering it earlier. He gave evidence alongside his father Rupert, who at one point during the hearing was attacked by a man who rushed forward from the public gallery and threw a paper plate of foam at him. The committee also said former News of the World editor Rebekah Brooks must \"accept responsibility\" for presiding over a culture at the News of the World that led to journalists impersonating members of Milly Dowler's family and hacking the teenager's phone. And it criticised Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer and former Acting Deputy Commissioner at the Metropolitan Police John Yates for failing to ensure hacking claims were properly investigated. After initially claiming malpractice was limited to one \"rogue\" reporter at the News of the World, News International has now settled dozens of civil cases admitting liability for hacking between 2001 and 2006. More than 6,000 possible victims have been identified and the police have so far made a number of arrests in connection with an investigation reopened in January 2011 - although no charges have yet been brought. Asked whether David Cameron regarded Rupert Murdoch as a fit person to run a media company, his official spokesman said: \"That is a matter for the regulatory authorities, not for the government.\" Labour leader Ed Miliband and Lib Dem Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg both said Ofcom must now be allowed to come to its own conclusion. The hacking revelations led to the closure of the News of the World and the government's decision to set up a judicial inquiry into press standards headed by Lord Leveson. Appearing before the Leveson Inquiry last week, Rupert Murdoch said there had been a \"cover-up\" which \"shielded\" senior figures at the paper and its parent company - including himself and his son James - from knowledge of wrongdoing taking place.",

John Kelly, whose brother Michael was killed in the 1972 atrocity, said the march was a \"deliberate insult\" to the people of Derry. Veterans for Justice UK expect about 100 former soldiers to take part in a march through the city next month. Organisers said it was to highlight \"injustices against soldiers\". Mr Kelly said the march by British Army veterans on 4 March \"must not be allowed to happen\". \"Clearly, this is an act of pure provocation and is totally insensitive to the nationalist population. It's a deliberate insult,\" he said. \"Its organisers should think carefully about the effect this could have on bereaved families here, families still reeling from the crimes of the past, not to mention the ordinary citizens of this city.\" Thirteen people were shot dead on 30 January 1972, and a 14th victim died later, after troops opened fire on a civil rights march. Speaking on behalf of the Bloody Sunday Trust, Minty Thompson said holding the march in Derry was a \"deliberately provocative act\". \"This city has clearly been chosen because it was the scene of one of the most horrific acts of state violence in our history, Bloody Sunday, and because soldiers who were involved in that event, who shot down innocent and unarmed people on our streets, are at long last being investigated for their actions,\" he said. The Northern Ireland branch of the Veterans for Justice UK group was established in December 2015. Anto Wickham, who is organising the Derry march, said their aims were to protect soldiers serving in Iraq and Afghanistan facing \"false prosecutions\". \"If soldiers break the law then they face the rigours of the law and rightly so, and it's the same as it should be for any other member of the community,\" he said. \"But where's the investigation into my colleagues and friends who were murdered? It just seems to be forgotten about.\" The former Royal Irish Regiment soldier added the marches were planned in 2016 as part of a larger campaign to put pressure on the government. Mr Wickham said he was \"upset\" by suggestions the march was planned to raise tensions in the city. \"I understand the families and the victims are still really hurt and they want prosecutions. \"If that's the case, and there is evidence, then you have to face the rigours of the law but that should also be the same with the IRA.\" The prosecution of those involved in killings is a major stumbling block in efforts to deal with the legacy of Northern Ireland's Troubles. Last month, the director of public prosecutions for Northern Ireland said critics who accused him of treating former soldiers unfairly had insulted him and his office. Barra McGrory QC said he was mystified by claims he did not act impartially when he brought charges against a small number of ex-soldiers. Meanwhile, lawyers representing former soldiers facing prosecution have said they are being 'unfairly treated'.",

The 58-year-old, who drew his first game in management with Bournemouth in 1992 on a plastic pitch at Preston, admits that a return to Stoke \"could not have been scripted better\". \"Players live a different life now,\" he said. \"In a world where they get everything, they've become film stars.\" Pulis managed the Potters for 464 matches over two spells and comes up against his old side with them bottom of the early Premier League table. But the Welshman - who has also managed Crystal Palace in the Premier League - expects current Stoke boss Mark Hughes to steer his side away from trouble. \"You couldn't have scripted it better to be honest, the fact that I'm going back to Stoke,\" Pulis said. \"It's fantastic. Whichever way the result goes, my 1,000th game will be at Stoke and I had great times there. \"Everything changes so quickly. A couple of games and Stoke could be two-thirds of the way up the table. What you've got to do, and I don't have to tell Mark how to manage, is to keep your feet on the ground. Keep looking ahead, keep pointing ahead and hope that things change. \"They have a very strong squad there and it's a surprise that they are down at the bottom. I'm sure they will get out of it - I just hope that it's not on Saturday that they start.\" Pulis first took charge of Bournemouth in the third tier of English football in August 1992, as the first Premier League season got under way. His big signing that summer was striker Steve Fletcher for \u00a330,000. This summer he broke West Brom's transfer record to spend \u00a313m on Nacer Chadli. He has been in charge for 277 Premier League games, 282 in the second tier, 258 in the third and 46 in the fourth. Pulis has also won games in the FA Cup, League Cup, Football League Trophy and the Europa League. \"I could sit here all afternoon and talk about what has changed,\" Pulis said. \"Human beings have changed, the world has changed. Professional football, especially the Premier League, is no reflection on real life to me now. \"I would never have changed apprentices coming in and doing apprenticeships and realising how fortunate they are, even to be apprentices, never mind make the professional grade. But we can't change life - you have to move with the times. \"Everybody wants change now. If you don't like a programme straight away you can turn it over.

At the time, I had him with the Under-21s. The first few months he played very well for us...then he had a difficult period for his club. \"He had a loan spell at Cardiff that didn't go so well and at the stage we had players like Tom Ince, who was performing better in the Championship out wide for us, so he dipped out of that group. \"Then obviously over the last couple of years, with respect, no-one was questioning him not being in our squad last summer (at the European Championships).\" Asked if the player's decision was now too far down the line, Southgate replied: \"I would like to speak to him before we make a decision and happy to make that happen.\" Zaha's slip down the pecking order for England opened up the chance for Ivory Coast to persuade the 24-year-old to switch to the Elephants.

Brian Krebs says the administrator of a Russian cybercrime forum hatched a plan to order heroin, arranged for it to be delivered to his home, then tipped off the police, making it look as if the call had come from a neighbour's house. Fortunately, Mr Krebs was already monitoring the website and saw the plot being planned in real time. He alerted the FBI and local police. \"I am little concerned\", he told the BBC. \"But then there are a lot of things people can do to upset you and get under your skin using a keyboard and few clicks of a mouse. \"But what's the next level?\" The person behind the attempted plot, according to Mr Krebs, set up a bitcoin wallet to accept donations of the digital currency from fellow forum members. He raised about $200 (\u00c2\u00a3131) worth of bitcoins and used it to buy 12 small bags of heroin using the Silk Road online black market. The package duly arrived at Mr Krebs's house, and he handed it over to the police. This is just the latest example of a sustained smear campaign against Mr Krebs orchestrated by hackers and cybercriminals disgruntled at his exposure of their antics. In March he was visited by a heavily armed police unit tricked into responding to a 911 call that had been made to look as if it originated from his home. Mr Krebs says he opened the front door to find a squad of policemen pointing a battery of guns at him. After being hand-cuffed and questioned, he managed to persuade the police they had been hoaxed by hackers. The informant had used a instant message relay service designed for hearing impaired and deaf people to pretend to be Mr Krebs reporting that Russians had broken into his home and shot his wife. The phenomenon, known as swatting, after the special weapons and tactics (Swat) teams called out to handle hostage and other dangerous situations, had begun on the West Coast, the police told Mr Krebs, but had been working its way eastwards. \"This type of individual prank puts peoples' lives at risk, wastes huge amounts of taxpayer dollars, and draws otherwise scarce resources away from real emergencies\", Mr Krebs blogged. \"What's more, there are a lot of folks who will confront armed force with armed force, all with the intention of self-defence.\" Mr Krebs also says his website suffered a major distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. This is when a large number of hijacked computers flood another computer server with messages to render it helpless. The site was taken offline temporarily as a result.

Mr Putin defended the meeting - a coup for Ms Le Pen - saying that he was not seeking to influence France's election. Ms Le Pen has garnered widespread support at home but her extreme views have deterred most foreign leaders. Russia was accused of meddling in the US election in support of Donald Trump. \"Of course I know that the election campaign in France is actively developing,\" said Mr Putin. \"We do not want to influence events in any way, but we reserve the right to talk to representatives of all the country's political forces,\" he added. Ms Le Pen, the leader of France's National Front (FN) party, called during her visit to Moscow for the lifting of EU sanctions against Russia, arguing that they were \"counterproductive\". When Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in March 2014, the US and EU imposed travel bans and asset freezes on individuals and companies linked to Russia's ruling elite. \"I believe that barring parliamentarians from speaking to each other, working together is an infringement of democratic rights,\" Interfax quoted Ms Le Pen. Speaking at Russia's lower house of parliament, the Duma, she vowed to push for the so-called \"blacklists\" of targeted individuals to be abolished. Ms Le Pen has previously stated her approval of Russia's annexation of of Crimea. She also said that Russia and France should work together to save the world from globalism and Islamic fundamentalism. Moscow likes what Marine Le Pen has to say. It likes her call for EU sanctions imposed on Russia to be scrapped. It likes her claim that \"Crimea has always been Russian\" and that \"there was no Russian invasion of Crimea\". It likes her commitment to forge a strong partnership with Moscow. Which explains why the Kremlin leader took the decision to meet her in Moscow. It's rare for Vladimir Putin to receive a presidential candidate from abroad. I asked President Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov whether any Russian banks or financial institutions intend to provide financing for Ms Le Pen's campaign. \"I don't have that information,\" he replied.

However, today, the French far-right presidential candidate was less than happy to deal with the media. Journalists crowded into the lower house of parliament, the Duma, for a le Pen press briefing. She never showed up. FN Treasurer Wallerand de Saint-Just has said Ms Le Pen's visit is not a cash-raising exercise, though party members have said they are seeking millions to fund the presidential and later the parliamentary election campaigns, the Associated Press news agency reports.

        "article": "A diabetes pill has anti-ageing effects and extends the life of male mice, research suggests. Scientists believe the drug, metformin, may mimic the effects of extreme calorie restriction. This regime, which is based on eating a very low calorie diet, is thought to promote healthy ageing. The human implications of the study are unclear, the researchers report in the journal, Nature Communications. Rafael de Cabo, of the National Institute on Ageing in Baltimore, Maryland, US, said calorie restriction in laboratory animals had been shown to increase their lifespan. His team is searching for interventions - such as a drug - that can mimic these effects. Metformin is one of the most widely prescribed treatments for type-2 diabetes, which occurs mainly in people above the age of 40. It is also used to treat metabolic syndrome, a combination of diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity. Previous work has shown that metformin can extend the lifespan of simple organisms such as worms, but studies in flies and mammals have given conflicting evidence. The scientists gave one of two different doses of metformin to middle-aged male mice and found that lower doses increased lifespan by about 5%, and also delayed the onset of age-associated diseases. But they said the higher dose of metformin was toxic and reduced the lifespan of mice. Further studies were needed to determine if metformin has any effect on human health and lifespan, said Dr de Cabo. \"These are very promising results that need to be translated to humans via clinical studies,\" he said. He said the best current advice was to eat a good diet and exercise. \"Right now the best that we can say is probably what your grandmother told you,\" he told BBC News. \"Eat a good diet and exercise are the only two things that we know for sure that they work very well in humans.\" Prof Tom Kirkwood, associate dean for ageing at Newcastle University, said it is unclear what the study might mean for human health. \"Metformin is a well-established drug that acts on metabolism and has long been used against type-2 diabetes,\" he said. \"We've known for a long time that modulating metabolism in mice can extend survival and postpone age-related conditions, and there are sound reasons why this should be the case is a small, short-lived animal. \"What we don't know however is whether similar effects on lifespan might be produced in humans. \"This is something that we cannot simply take for granted and the study's authors do well to sound a note of caution.\"",

        "article": "Plans to build the first new UK nuclear plant in 20 years have suffered an unexpected delay after the government postponed a final decision until the early autumn. French firm EDF, which is financing most of the \u00a318bn Hinkley Point project in Somerset, approved the funding at a board meeting. Contracts were to be signed on Friday. But Business Secretary Greg Clark has said the government will \"consider carefully\" before backing it. EDF chief executive Vincent de Rivaz has cancelled a trip to Hinkley Point on Friday following Mr Clark's comments. Critics of the plan have warned of environmental damage and potential escalating costs. They are also concerned that the plant is being built by foreign governments. One third of the \u00a318bn cost is being provided by Chinese investors. Hours after EDF's board voted to approve the \u00a318bn power plant on Thursday, the government launched a further review of the project. This stunning new development came all the way from the top of government and the timing seemed calculated to cause maximum impact. EDF executives were taken completely off guard, the post-Brexit run of major investment is abruptly halted and what precious entente cordiale in Anglo-French relations there is left after the EU referendum result seems diminished. Is it a genuine pause for a new government to read the small print of a project that is two administrations old, or a signal of a potential change in policy? Simon Jack: Hinkley delay is a high stakes bet Tom Greatrex, the chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, urged the government to make a decision as soon as possible. \"We need to get on and do this and that's why I'm hoping the government make their decision very soon because if it goes on for a lengthy period of time we are going to run the risk of having real problems in terms of our energy supplies,\" he said. \"Then what happens is that we end up paying a lot more and we end up paying for much more dirty power which we can't afford to do if we are to meet our climate commitments.\" Claire Jacobson, head of climate, energy and environment policy at the EEF manufacturers' organisation said the government's decision was \"yet another blow to a decision that has been hindered by many delays and uncertainties\". Hinkley Point C is expected to provide 7% of the UK's total electricity requirement. Announcing the approval of investment on Thursday, EDF had described the plant as \"a unique asset for French and British industries\", saying it would benefit the nuclear sectors in both countries and would give a boost to employment. However, the project has been hit in recent months by concerns about EDF's financial capacity. Despite the Chinese investment, Hinkley Point would remain an enormous undertaking for the stressed French company, which has had to raise money from its owners. Earlier this week, EDF shareholders approved plans to issue new shares to raise \u20ac4bn (\u00a33.4bn) to help pay for the project. Ahead of Thursday's vote on whether to approve the project, an EDF board member, Gerard Magnin, resigned, saying the project was \"very risky\" financially. Earlier this year, EDF's finance director, Thomas Piquemal, had resigned amid reports he thought Hinkley could damage EDF itself. 5,600 workers on site at peak 4,000km electrical cabling 230,000 tonnes of steel 5.6m cubic metres of earth to be moved Environmentalists are also concerned about the plan. Greenpeace executive director John Sauven said: \"Countless experts have warned that for British families this power station will be terrible value for money. He added that EDF's decision to go ahead with the investment, \"doesn't prove the UK is open for business post-Brexit - it just shows the Hinkley deal became too big to fail in the eyes of British and French politicians\". The campaign group added that more investment was needed for renewable energy such as offshore wind. Jan 2006 - Government proposes nuclear as part of future energy mix Mar 2013 - Construction of Hinkley Point approved Oct 2013 - UK government agrees \u00a392.50 per megawatt-hour will be paid for electricity produced at the Somerset site - around double the current market rate at the time Oct 2015 - EDF signs investment agreement with China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN) July 2016 - EDF board approves final investment decision, but the UK Government postpones a final decision on the project until autumn.",

Mr Lewandowski is charged with simple battery over his encounter with former Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields. Police allege that on 8 March after a news conference in Florida, he grabbed her arm when she tried to ask Mr Trump a question, leaving a bruise. Mr Lewandowski plans to plead not guilty, the Trump campaign said. Police in Jupiter, Florida, where he was arrested, have released new footage of the alleged assault. The security video appears to show him trying to pull Ms Fields out of the way as she walks alongside Mr Trump and tries to speak to him. \"Mr Lewandowksi is absolutely innocent of this charge,\" the Trump statement said. \"He is completely confident that he will be exonerated.\" Mr Trump himself has defended Mr Lewandowski on Twitter, saying the police footage shows there was \"nothing there\". If Donald Trump is going to win the Republican nomination without a convention fight, he will have to endure yet another string of political blows that would stagger even the strongest campaign. A week before a key primary in Wisconsin, Scott Walker - the state's governor - gave a full-throated endorsement of rival Ted Cruz. Now Mr Lewandowski has been charged over his manhandling of a female reporter during a rally. This comes after a particularly tawdry few days in the Republican presidential battle as Mr Trump and Mr Cruz engaged in a war of words over their spouses. The New York property developer has been able to maintain his front-runner status for months despite countless controversies and conflagrations. This time may be different, however. Recent events are likely to cause further damage to Mr Trump's already poor standing with female voters. The Republican presidential pack has been whittled to just three candidates, with the not-Trump vote consolidating behind Mr Cruz. Mr Trump's path to securing the Republican nomination is a narrow one, so the slightest stumble could deny him the prize outright. Then it's on to the convention, where party loyalists and a growing cadre of Cruz-friendly activists hold sway. The charge comes during a difficult time for Mr Trump, just ahead of next week's Wisconsin primary where he is neck-and-neck with Senator Ted Cruz. Earlier on Tuesday, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker endorsed Mr Cruz for president. Mr Trump will participate in a CNN town hall event on Tuesday night when all three Republican contenders will face questions. He is currently well ahead in the Republican race with 739 delegates to Cruz's 465.

The Street & Arrow food truck, in Glasgow's Partick, is to take on additional trainees by March 2017. And it plans to expand operations across Scotland to address the social challenges of those with criminal convictions. The scheme has received \u00a3208,000 of Scottish government funding. The social enterprise company behind the project, Braveheart Industries (BHI), operates the airstream-style food truck providing training, mentoring and support for offenders who have made a commitment to change their lives away from violence and crime. It is supported by Police Scotland's Violence Reduction Unit (VRU) BHI trades under the banner of Street & Arrow in a play on the phrase \"straight and narrow\", which often describes the aim of people with convictions. It is based on the successful Homeboy Industries Programme in Los Angeles, which has taken on more than 10,000 former gang members in an effort to make a positive change. The BHI social enterprise model was initially targeted at deprived areas in Glasgow, but Insp Iain Murray of the VRU said it is hoped to expand the idea across Scotland. \"There is a need in many locations. We would like to see this throughout the country,\" he said. \"These are guys and girls who deserve a second chance.

She said she had now been clean for a year, and was happy that customers could see an ex-offender putting something back into the community. \"It's proof that you can change. Your life doesn't need to be chaotic and there is a way out,\" she said. \"I'm earning a proper wage, and I'm paying taxes now. I have a place of my own and I'm paying the council tax, so I am contributing to society.\" Justice Secretary Michael Matheson said it was important that members of the public being served at the food truck know that offenders taking part must be free from drugs or alcohol dependence. \"This is a very good example of individuals who are seeking to turn their lives around by trying to get themselves into employment and put something back into the community. \"It's a facility which is well valued in the local community, it's well used, and it's also producing a very high quality and high standard of food and drink. \"What's important here is equipping these individuals with the skills to be able to move into employment in the future, and we know in the catering industry there are opportunities to move into that industry.\" BHI has operated with offenders at the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo since 2012, and in the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games.

But each day, as the tide begins to ebb and the beachgoers return to their hotels, a small army of men and women armed with sticks and spears wade out across the coastal flats in search of one of the Tanzanian island's finest delicacies - octopus. During a single low tide a skilled octopus hunter can spear more than 10 of the slimy invertebrates, which thrive amid the maze of rocks, corals and sea grass that lie beyond the beaches. The catch is highly prized by the island's tourist hotels and provides an important source of protein for coastal communities. Protected by an offshore reef, the tidal flats off the island's east coast provide livelihoods and sustenance for local residents, in the form of fish, crabs, shellfish, seaweed and octopus. Tanzania is the largest producer of octopus in the western Indian Ocean. Abdullah Ali, 35, prepares to launch his traditional wooden boat on an octopus hunting expedition from Dongwe village. Traditionally a female-dominated activity, more men are now turning to octopus for a source of income. \"The octopus has helped me to drive my life forward,\" said Ali, who makes about \u00a31.90 ($2.30) per kg (2lb 3oz) for his octopuses. According to data from the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation, catches in Tanzania have increased from 482 tonnes in 1990 to more than 1,250 in 2012. The mix of jagged rocks and corals near the reef offer many places for the octopuses to hide at low tide, becoming almost invisible to the untrained eye. Thousands of sea urchins provide a further challenge. Mariam, an octopus hunter from Bwejuu village, plunges into the water to cool off after a morning's work. Mama Juma, a seasoned octopus hunter, scans the crystal clear water near Paje beach for likely octopus hideouts. A lone woman searches for octopus in the evening beyond a seaweed farm at Bwejuu. Local communities derive much of their livelihood from the intertidal flats. Grilled octopus is a staple at the nightly seafood market in Stone Town.

Mr Turnbull, who was communications minister under Mr Abbott, is the fourth prime minister since 2013. After taking the oath of office, Mr Turnbull attended his first Question Time in parliament as prime minister. Mr Abbott on Tuesday said his removal was \"tough\" but promised not to undermine the new government. In his first public comments since his removal by the Liberal party late on Monday, Mr Abbott said it had been \"a tough day, but when you join the game, you accept the rules\". He said he was proud of what his government had achieved, while also taking swipes at party members who had leaked to the media and carried out \"a sour, bitter character assassination\". He did not say if he would remain on the backbench or eventually resign from politics. Mr Abbott's removal followed weeks of tumbling polls ratings and speculation about a challenge to his leadership. In a move led by Mr Turnbull and his deputy and Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, Mr Abbott was voted out by the Liberal party by 54 votes to 44. In his first Question Time session in parliament, Mr Turnbull paid tribute to Mr Abbott, and said these are \"the most exciting times to be an Australian\". \"The future is one of great opportunities and that requires confidence and leadership and it will be lost if we embrace the politics of fear and scaremongering.\" He said policies would \"change in the light of changed conditions\", but did not signal any immediate amendments to contentious issues including same sex marriage and climate policy. Opposition Labor leader Bill Shorten said Mr Abbott had been \"a formidable fighter\" in office, and praised his \"generous and personal\" nature. Mr Turnbull is not expected to announce a new cabinet line-up until the end of the week. But following his fierce criticism of Mr Abbott's economic leadership, there has been speculation that Joe Hockey might lose the Treasury portfolio. Ms Bishop, who has retained her role as deputy, said that Mr Abbott had \"done a fantastic job in winning the 2013 election\" but that \"a number of people felt that he hadn't met their expectations\". After surviving another leadership challenge in February, Mr Abbott had asked for six months to turn the Liberal Party's electoral hopes around, she said. \"Now seven months later the majority have decided they wanted a change of leader and that he had lost their confidence.\" But she said Mr Abbot was \"obviously very hurt\". Mr Turnbull said on Monday night the government would serve a full term, meaning a general election is likely in mid-2016. The first real test of how the public has taken the news will be on Saturday in a by-election for the seat of Canning in Western Australia. The seat is held by the Liberal Party. Opinion polling done before Monday night's ballot suggested the Liberals would retain the seat but at a reduced majority.",

Chester have been reinstated as a Conference Premier club and Hayes & Yeading will stay in Conference South. \"Hereford United can have no complaints. The Conference bent over backwards to help them. \"I described the news of the board's offer of an extension on Friday evening as not so much 'last chance saloon', but rather 'last orders in last chance saloon' and United have seemingly chosen not to offer the league the assurances they were seeking. \"It is a desperately sad day for all Hereford supporters, but the Bulls have nobody to blame but themselves. \"You have to feel very sorry for those players who gave their all at Aldershot on the last day of the season to keep Hereford in the Conference Premier. Sadly, those efforts now count for nothing.\" The Conference had originally offered a payment deadline of Thursday, 5 June. The club's debt to their football creditors, including former boss Martin Foyle, members of the current squad, other club staff and clubs from whom the Bulls loaned players during the 2013-14 season, added up to \u00a3148,000. That deadline was extended three times, to Friday, 6 June, then again to Saturday, 7 June and for a third time until Thursday, 12 June. But it became clear on Tuesday that the Bulls, taken over last week by London businessman Tommy Agombar, would not make that deadline - and the Conference has now acted. The last team to be expelled from the Conference was Chester City in February 2010. They reformed as Chester FC two months later - and it is now they who have taken the Bulls' place, following a dramatic final day of the season when, almost simultaneously, a late Hereford winning goal at Aldershot and a Salisbury equaliser at Chester kept the Bulls up. By way of an added twist, Chester announced on Tuesday that Kingsley James, who was in Hereford's team that day, has moved to Bumpers Lane. 26 April - Hereford stay up on final day of Conference Premier season 29 April - Hereford United Supporters' Trust make offer to buy the club for \u00a31 and clear their \u00a3220,000 debts 22 May -  Former Bulls boss Martin Foyle serves winding-up petition over unpaid wages, after players reveal they have not been fully paid too 2 June - Case adjourned for 28 days at Royal Court of Justice 3 June - Tommy Agombar takes over as new Hereford owner 5 June - Hereford fail to meet 17:00 BST deadline to pay football creditors, and are threatened with expulsion, subject to Conference board vote 6 June - Hereford meet with Conference board and are given new deadline of 7 June. The deadline is moved to 9 June, then 12 June 10 June - Hereford expelled from Football Conference And former Hereford boss Foyle, now manager at Southport, chose the same day to sign another player from that same Bulls team, keeper Dan Lloyd-Weston, who opted to leave as he was still owed part of his salary. When last season ended, despite months of fundraising efforts by fans, as well as generous donations from fans of other clubs, the Bulls faced debts of approximately \u00a3225,000. They still owe over \u00a370,000 to clear the latest PAYE tax demand from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).

Angus Crawford visited three sites to find out how they are living. Miracle is sleeping. He cannot tell me anything about the conditions in Moria camp. He is unaware of the smell of raw sewage that hangs around the entrance gate.  He does not know about the fighting between migrants that insiders say breaks out on a regular basis. Luckily on Tuesday the tear gas fired by police at young migrants throwing stones never reached him. He does not have to stand in line for hours to get food. Miracle is just 10 months old and is strapped to his mother's back. She tells me her name is Blessing. She says she is Nigerian, a Christian from Kano, and that she left because of the Islamist militants, Boko Haram. I have no way of independently checking her story. But here she is in Moria, once a transit camp for migrants, now since the EU deal with Turkey, a detention centre, run by central government. There are several thousand people inside even though it was never built to house so many. It is another sign of how Greece was simply overwhelmed by the numbers who came, while itself in the middle of an economic crisis. Most of those who arrived before March 20, the start of the EU-Turkey agreement, are free to come and go, but cannot leave the island. Those who came after that date are locked in, waiting for a decision about their asylum claims. Moria's chain link fence, topped with razor wire, snakes on its way up into olive groves.  It surrounds a collection of converted shipping containers, large white plastic shelters and small tents. I meet one man who says simply, \"in here, I fear for my life\". 'A hellish Glastonbury' Five minutes drive away, another camp. There is no razor wire, no police guarding the gate. The first thing I see is an electronic display board. It reads \"the camp director wishes you a pleasant and safe stay\". There are orderly lines of white UN refugee agency tents. Children run up and down the pathways between them. This is run by the council, for migrants who arrived before the 20th, and for the vulnerable: families with children, pregnant women and the disabled. They can leave the camp, but not Lesbos. One aid worker tells me it is the best camp he has seen. It sits on top of a hill, surrounded on three sides by the Aegean. In the distance lie the ruins of a castle. The facilities may be better and site picturesque, but those who I meet inside tell me it is still in effect an open air waiting room. Amiyah is 19 and from Damascus. The rest of her family are in Germany. But she cannot join them. Abdul, who is 16, complains about the food and says everyone is getting sick. Tareq tells me he had only \u00e2\u201a\u00ac50 left after paying a smuggler, but yesterday even that was stolen. The migrant crisis in seven charts The Plaza is an eight storey hotel not far from the centre of Athens. It has three stars and more than 60 rooms. There are more than 140 guests, but none of them have to pay to stay. The hotel was a casualty of the economic crash, going bankrupt in 2010 and closing its doors. But last Friday a group of activists and former workers unlawfully reopened the Plaza, with migrants as guests. The reception is manned by volunteers 24 hours a day and the kitchen turns out food. There are more than 70 children staying here. When we visit there is laughter and singing from the playroom on the first floor. And in a rack by the entrance, yellowing maps of Athens still waiting for the tourists who never came.",

Villa instead appointed Roberto Di Matteo, but he was sacked after 124 days and replaced by Steve Bruce. \"They wanted bigger names I think, they took the lad [Di Matteo] and that is how it goes,\" Warnock said ahead of Cardiff's visit to Villa Park. \"I thought at the time that's their loss not mine.\" The 67-year-old continued: ''There were about five clubs I spoke to. You have to look at that when you get to my age. \"I would not be here if one or two of those things had cropped up, but I am really pleased I am here. It is probably fate.\" Warnock had discussions with a number of clubs in the summer, including Nottingham Forest, before joining Cardiff following the departure of Paul Trollope in October. Trollope has since been appointed assistant manager at Brighton, replacing Colin Calderwood who left to join Bruce at Villa. After sacking Di Matteo, who lasted just 12 games, Villa opted for former Hull manager Bruce just a week after Warnock had been installed at Cardiff. Warnock thinks Bruce is the right man to bring success to Villa following their Premier League relegation as he is a similar manager to himself. ''With Steve and myself you get what you see. I was disappointed I did not get a chance with Villa in the summer if I'm honest, because I thought it would have been ideal to sort everything out,\" Warnock told BBC Wales. \"That is why I am not surprised at all Steve has gone in and done really well. \"I am not saying we are similar types, but we have the same philosophies regarding management. ''I think Steve is the right one now. He knows it's a massive club. He will be looking forward to it. \"We have had some right battles over the years. He knows he's in for a tough game on Saturday.'' Warnock believes Bruce, unbeaten at Villa, deserved a crack at the England job. ''Personally I thought he should have been England manager at the time,\" he said. \"With his experience, playing wise, what he had done and his age and his enthusiasm, it was an ideal position for him in the summer.

The day before saw a strike ballot on career progression with the part-time Night Tube drivers and a dispute over a \"breakdown in industrial relations\" with maintenance workers. Why? Well it seems that industrial relations are being redrawn. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he would bring in a more constructive relationship with the unions. He also promised \"zero strikes\". That didn't happen. But I know for a fact the mayor, the transport commissioner, the TSSA and the RMT unions have met - that is in stark contrast to the previous administration. However, with this new relationship there are now new tensions. Transport bosses seem bemused the unions are upset over the relocation over eight drivers from Essex depots to Earl's Court. They claim it is in black and white in the contracts agreed by the unions themselves. They have quoted the contract: \"Your normal work location will be Leytonstone Train Crew depot Central Line. \"[London Underground Ltd] will endeavour to allocate you to an operating location convenient to you, but reserves the right to require you to work at any place it may from time to time determine within the area served by [London Underground Ltd] and London Bus Services.\" Bosses also say the new Night Tube contracts (agreed by the unions) set out that drivers must stay in their new positions for 18 months. I put it to Peter McNaught - an Operations Director at London Underground - that this was meant to be a new era of friendlier industrial relations. \"I don't know,\" he replied. \"This one and the dispute that's just been announced on Night Tube, these are long standing agreements we have with the trade unions. \"The ink is still wet on the Night Tube agreement. The unions signed up to it and now we're in dispute about something they only agreed to five months ago.\" \"I think it goes beyond London Underground and what we're doing. It's quite strange.\" The unions are clearly empowered by the new relationship. They think the extra 325 staff agreed after the recent strikes over the station staff closures was a victory and are now pushing to achieve more for their members. I asked John Leach from the RMT if he felt his union was now trying it on under the new mayor. He said: \"I think it's the opposite. \"There is a disconnect between the senior management and their superior people at City Hall in my opinion. \"We're hearing that we should have better industrial relations and then when we talk to management we're up against the same old, same old.\" Redrawing industrial relations is not straight forward.

        "article": "DNA analysis of a 45,000-year-old human has helped scientists pinpoint when our ancestors interbred with Neanderthals. The genome sequence from a thigh bone found in Siberia shows the first episode of mixing occurred between 50,000 and 60,000 years ago. The male hunter is one of the earliest modern humans discovered in Eurasia. The study in Nature journal also supports the finding that our species emerged from Africa some 60,000 years ago, before spreading around the world. The analysis raises the possibility that the human line first emerged millions of years earlier than current estimates. The work of Prof Svante Paabo, from the Max Planck Institute in Leipzig, Germany, is rewriting the story of humanity. Prof Paabo and his colleagues have pioneered methods to extract DNA from ancient human remains and read its genetic code. From this sequence, the scientist has been able to decipher an increasingly detailed story of modern humans as they spread across the globe. \"The amazing thing is that we have a good genome of a 45,000-year-old person who was close to the ancestor of all present-day humans outside Africa,\" He told BBC News. Prof Paabo has analysed DNA from part of a leg bone of a man that lived in Western Siberia around 45,000 years ago. This is a key moment at the cross roads of the world, when modern humans were on the cusp of an expansion into Europe and Asia. The key finding was that the man had large, unshuffled chunks of DNA from a now extinct species of human, Neanderthals, who evolved outside of Africa. \"Our analysis shows that modern humans had already interbred with Neanderthals then, and we can determine when that first happened much more precisely than we could before.\" Prof Paabo and his team published research in 2010 that showed that all non-African humans today have Neanderthal DNA. But that genetic material has been broken into much smaller chunks over the generations. By extrapolating the size of DNA chunks backwards, Prof Paabo and his colleagues were able to calculate when the first interbreeding with Neanderthals occurred. His study shows that it was between 50,000 and 60,000 years ago. According to Prof Chris Stringer of the Natural History Museum in London, this early interbreeding might indicate when the ancestors of people living outside of Africa today made their first steps out of the continent in which our species evolved more than 150,000 years ago. Prof Stringer was among those who believed that the first exit by modern humans from Africa that give rise to people outside of Africa today might have happened earlier, possibly 100,000 years ago. The evidence from Prof Paabo's research is persuading him that it was now much later. \"There is a dispute as to when that 'Out of Africa' event happened and this fossil helps to look at that. It is close to the time I think that modern humans exited from Africa and gave rise to the populations in the rest of the world. I think that exit happened 60,000 years ago,\" he told BBC News. The new narrative seems to fit in with a recent new, more accurate dating of the arrival of modern humans into Europe by Prof Thomas Higham of Oxford University. Research published in August showed that this happened 45,000 years ago. Prof Paabo's 45,000-year-old man seems to have lived at a point that was both geographically, and in time, a crossroads for humanity. \"This does seem to mark a watershed where modern humans were pushing the boundaries further and further in their dispersal out of Africa,\" according to Prof Stringer. Prof Paabo also compared the DNA of the man living 45,000 years ago with those living today. He found that the man was genetically midway between Europeans and Asians - indicating he lived close to the time before our species separated into different racial groups. Prof Paabo was also able to estimate the rate at which human DNA has changed or mutated over the millennia. He found that it was slower than the rate suggested by fossil evidence and similar to what has been observed in families. \"We have caught evolution red-handed!\" he said gleefully. This raises the possibility that the very first species of the human line separated from apes 10 or 11 million years ago - rather than the five or six million years ago that genetic evidence had previously suggested. But he stressed in his research paper that much more analysis was needed before re-dating the emergence of the human line. \"We caution that (mutation) rates may have changed over time and may differ between human populations,\" he said.

        "article": "US prosecutors have dropped all charges against a man who spent 25 years in prison for murder, amid allegations police had falsified evidence. Desmond Ricks' lawyers say homicide detectives switched bullets in his mother's gun to pin a shooting on him. He was convicted of gunning down a friend outside a restaurant in Detroit, Michigan, in March 1992, and sentenced to at least 32 years in prison. Mr Ricks, 51, was released from prison last Friday. On Thursday, Wayne County prosecutor's office said Mr Ricks would not face a second trial. \"I hope you enjoy your newfound freedom,\" Judge Richard Skutt told the exonerated man, who heaved a sigh of relief. Mr Ricks' case was championed by lawyers and students from the Innocence Clinic at the University of Michigan's law school. They managed to get the investigation reopened in 2016 after pointing out that two bullets taken from the victim, Gerry Bennett, looked different from the rounds presented at trial. Police investigators had maintained the bullets held up as key evidence were fired from Mr Ricks' mother's pistol. 'How I survived 22 years on death row' US man freed after 28 years in prison But a state police report last month established the bullets from the victim did not match the 38-calibre gun that belonged to Mr Ricks' mother. \"I've got no time to be bitter at anybody,\" Mr Ricks said outside Wayne Circuit Court after Thursday's hearing, reports the Detroit News. \"There's no excuse for what they did, but I have to move on. I just didn't want to die in prison. \"Now, I'm just trying to get some semblance of my life back. I just want to pay my taxes and be a good citizen.\" Mr Ricks is expected to be compensated thanks to a new Michigan law that awards wrongly convicted prisoners $50,000 (\u00c2\u00a338,800) for each year spent in prison, which would make him eligible for $1.25m. David Moran, director of the Innocence Clinic, said the police conduct was criminal, but no retired officers can be brought to justice because too much time has passed. \"If it happened once it would be very surprising if there's not a lot of other cases like it,\" he said. The Detroit police gun laboratory that handled the case was shut down in 2008 because of errors in ballistic testing.",

        "article": "Have you heard the one about the computer programmer who bought a failing comedy club in Texas and turned it into a million dollar a year business? It's no joke. But Kareem Badr says people did laugh in 2009 when he and two friends paid $20,000 (\u00c2\u00a313,000) for the Hideout in Austin, when it wasn't making money and the previous owner decided not to renew the lease. \"We took over a sinking ship and each brought a bucket to bail it out,\" says Mr Badr. \"None of us had any experience of running a business. But we loved what we were doing enough that it carried us through.\" Three years ago he was able to quit his day job and draw a salary from the club. Mr Badr says it's still not as much as he used to make as a programmer (about $80,000 a year), but he now employs around 25 part time and contract workers. And he recently expanded the premises, taking over the adjoining coffee house which sells alcohol, and leasing more theatre space. Mr Badr says: \"I think my background in computer science helped because I can take a big problem, break it up into small chunks, and figure out how to make it better and more efficient. \"That's basically what we did for every aspect of the business. And by doing that it naturally started to improve.\" Mr Badr may have been helped by national trends, which imply a growing enthusiasm for comedy clubs in the US. An industry report from data firm Ibis World expects total US annual comedy club revenue to grow by 1.8% over the next five years to $344.6m in 2020. \"When the Hideout first opened it was the only improv theatre in Austin,\" says Mr Badr. \"But now there are five [comedy] schools and four theatres. We were at the right place at the right time.\" While the Ibis World report showed that dozens of US comedy clubs were forced to close in the wake of the 2008 recession, when fewer people had disposable income to spend on live entertainment, Stephen Rosenfield, director of the American Comedy Institute in New York, says stand-up comedy is now entering a new golden age. \"The US has comedy clubs all over the country, not just in big cities, and they require talent,\" he says. \"In any field there are those at the top who make dynastic fortunes. But because of the significance of the local comedy club, there is a career and a living to be made by good comedians who are not superstars.\" Mr Rosenfield says the growing popularity of stand-up comedy is fuelled in part by younger audiences, who view humorous TV hosts such as Jon Stewart, Jay Leno and Steve Colbert as their primary source for news. \"It's not just entertaining them, it's also informing them,\" he says. \"There's a new immediacy to stand-up that makes it much more appealing to a generation that's on social media, tweeting, face booking and blogging.\" But clubs don't only make money from entertainers. Alcohol alone can bring in as much as 40% of the night's takings, and many clubs demand that audiences buy a minimum number of drinks per person. \"A club really has three businesses going on,\" says Mr Rosenfield. \"It's an entertainment entity, a restaurant and a bar. They make money from selling drinks and dinners, and they make money from the cover charge. \"There are usually three people on the bill. The opening act is the new comedian. They do about 20 minutes and introduce the other comics. The middle act does about half an hour, and then there's the headliner. They almost always have TV credits, and are the ones people are coming to see. That headliner could be making six figures a year.\" Top-tier performers make much more. According to Forbes, Canadian comedian Russell Peters grossed $19m with 64 shows in 2013, while industry veteran Jerry Seinfeld is the highest paid comedian in the US, set to earn $36m this year. Steve Byrne, 41, is a veteran stand-up comedian based in LA, and star of his own television show Sullivan and Son, which ran for three seasons. He describes himself as a successful mid-level comedian who makes an annual six figure salary mainly from touring. And although he was close to hitting a million dollars a year before his show was cancelled in 2014, he says most comedians make money at clubs and do television to boost their brand rather than their income. Mr Bryne says: \"Gigs vary because it depends what you're contracted at. \"If it's somebody starting off in the business it could be $1,500 a show. For somebody who's had some TV credits you could go from $4,500 to $7,500. \"And if you're just a knock out comic, then you're coming in and getting a door deal. You're taking all the tickets, and the club gets the concessions.\" Mr Byrne says hard work is the key to success. There is no magic short cut, and few lucky breaks. \"The one single thing that an aspiring comedian should do is write, write, write. What is it that makes you laugh? \"Your voice should resonate with your audience. So find your voice and you will find your audience.\" While the music and film industries have been impacted by the internet, such as illegal downloads and reduced album sales, Mr Rosenfield says the online world has actually given live comedy a boost. \"The format of comedy, particularly stand-up, lends itself to digital media like nothing else. One terrific joke can get a million hits,\" he says. \"It's become a new metric for a club manager. If a booker sees that a comic has 500,000 online followers - they'll book him almost sight unseen. That's it. \"Digital is gigantically important and has been for a while.\" But in the end, the success of comedy comes down to a very simple fact - people need to laugh. Back in 2001 Steve Byrne was a comedian in New York when terrorists flew two planes into the World Trade Centre on 11 September. He says: \"We all thought 'who's going to come to a comedy club? The dream's over, I've got to get a real job now'. \"But after a week, I forget which club was the first one to open its doors, but it was packed. People needed an outlet. \"And I remember for months on end those clubs in New York City were just jam packed. That was the thing that told me that this was a profession that is foolproof.\"",

Holding a 12ft (3.7m) long steel-tipped wooden lance in front of him, he rides a stallion full pelt towards another would-be knight coming at him in a similarly determined attempt to knock him off his horse. \"You are both moving at about 20mph (32km/h), so [if the other person's lance hits you] it is like hitting a brick wall at 40mph. \"I have never fallen off, but I have taken three people out of the saddle. Historically people have died, and it is always the lance tip going through the eye slot [of the helmet].\" Given how Jason spends his weekends, you might imagine that his day job is equally daring, that he is some sort of professional stuntman. Instead, he is the chief executive of one of the UK's largest computer games companies - Rebellion Developments. Jason set up the Oxford-based business with his younger brother Chris in 1992, and today it has an annual turnover of more than \u00c2\u00a325m. Still wholly owned by the two siblings, its best-selling titles include Sniper Elite and Rogue Trooper. For the past 17 years the company has also owned cult UK comic book series 2000 AD, and publishes a range of novels. While Jason doesn't wear one of his \u00c2\u00a325,000 suits of armour in the office, he says that he tries to run Rebellion - and all other aspects of his life - according to a medieval knight's chivalric code of conduct. \"What the code comes down to is try to be a decent person... and there are three parts - bravery, honesty and kindness. \"In business the need to be brave is obvious; the ability to charge forward and seize the opportunity, and do the best that you can with it. \"It is also about exploring new territories and seeking out new markets. It is an essential component in being a leader.\" He adds: \"Honesty doesn't mean telling everyone your secrets, it means dealing fairly with people. \"So in business, I don't try to get the best deal for myself, I'm trying to get the best deal for both sides. \"This is fairer and the right thing to do, and if the other side makes a profit they will come back and work with me again. \"And kindness is simply about the need to treat people well.\" As a teenager Jason says that he and his brother both loved role-playing games. They would sit around a table with their friends and each take on a fantasy character, such as a wizard or knight. Dice would then be thrown to determine how the characters interacted with each other, and how the stories developed. Jason also wrote a number of \"gamebooks\", where the reader has to decide how the story develops from multiple-choice options. Studying at Oxford University, they started to develop and programme computer games as a hobby. After they both graduated, Jason says they decided to start Rebellion \"because we loved games, and we saw an opportunity in making computer games\". He adds: \"It really was just naivety and enthusiasm, but I think that is a really good reason for starting a business, because it is much easier to be successful if you love what you are doing.\" Working on a number of demo games, Rebellion got its first big break in 1993 when it won a contract from then-games giant Atari to produce the title Alien vs Predator. The game was a bestseller, and Rebellion has never looked back. After making games for other companies, such as James Bond and various titles for The Simpsons, it today tries to focus more on producing and distributing its own material. Jason says: \"We knew we wanted to build up our own IP (intellectual property) and fund our own games, and that is where we are now. \"It has taken us a long time, 25 years to get there... but we now come up with the ideas, fully fund the games, and release them ourselves worldwide. And that's great, there's no-one else in the loop.\" Profits from the computer games sales have also been used to expand the business into other areas, such as buying 2000 AD, home to cult comic character Judge Dredd. While Jason won't reveal the exact cost of the deal, he says it was \"many millions\". \"We felt that 2000 AD was on the decline [under its then-Danish owner], and needed to be owned and cherished by someone British who knew the culture of what it was trying to do. \"I genuinely think it is an important bit of our cultural heritage.\" Gaming industry expert Dan Maher says that Rebellion has been particularly praised for its custodianship of the 2000 AD comic book. \"As the name suggests, the company prides itself on going against the grain, using the money earned from an industry driven by bleeding-edge technology to make uncynical acquisitions in the traditional publishing sector,\" says Mr Maher. \"Such moves, driven as they are by real love and appreciation for comics and sci-fi, have earned them great respect from consumers and professionals alike.\" Jason has the boss role on a day-to-day basis at Rebellion, while his brother Chris holds the chief technology officer position. But before he goes to work, Jason spends two hours every morning looking after his 13 horses, and then two hours again in the evening. \"Yes I could afford to get staff to do it all for me but I like doing it. The horses are my friends, my family,\" he says.",

        "article": "Theresa May has said China must do more to help end North Korea's \"illegal and provocative\" weapons testing. On a visit to Japan, the prime minister welcomed UN condemnation of Pyongyang and said the UK was looking at ways of exerting further pressure on the North Korean regime, including from China. Mrs May is also aiming to allay Japan's concerns over Brexit and drum up trade. She said Japanese firms continued to make \"important\" investments in the UK as EU withdrawal was being negotiated. She hailed British carmaker Aston Martin's decision to invest \u00c2\u00a3500m in Japan as a sign of the strength of the two countries' economic partnership. The luxury brand announced on Wednesday it would significantly step up its exports to Japan, open a number of new offices next year and expand its dealer network. Japan is preoccupied with the issue of North Korea's missile test over its northern Hokkaido island. Speaking to the BBC after arriving for a three day visit, Mrs May urged China to exert its influence over Pyongyang. \"I want to work with other international partners to do what we all want to do which is to stop North Korea from conducting these illegal activities,\" she said. \"These are illegal tests. It is outrageous, it is provocative and they should be stopped.\" The UK was working to see what \"further pressure\" could be brought on North Korea, including extending sanctions, and the role that China could play in facilitating such action. But asked about the comments, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said the focus should be on de-escalating tensions in the Korean peninsula and \"just chanting about sanctions\" was not the answer. Meeting late on Tuesday in New York, the United Nations Security Council called the launch \"outrageous\", demanding North Korea cease all missile testing. But North Korea has signalled plans for more launches, suggesting its firing of a missile over Japan was \"the first step\" of military operations in the Pacific. Mr Abe greeted his counterpart when she arrived in Kyoto before the two leaders went to a teahouse for a traditional tea-drinking ceremony, followed by a formal dinner at the Kyoto State Guest House. They then took the bullet train to Tokyo, where formal talks will take place on Thursday. Downing Street said the two leaders had discussed the Brexit process to date and the UK's position on key issues. Mrs May, who is being accompanied on the trip by International Trade Secretary Liam Fox and a delegation of business leaders drawn from a range of sectors, told her counterpart that the UK saw Japan's proposed free trade deal with the EU as a \"good basis\" for the beginning of a future UK trading agreement with Japan. The UK is unable to sign any bilateral deals until it has left the EU in 2019. Japan has been forthright in expressing concerns about Brexit's impact on its UK-based firms, which employ about 140,000 people. Mr Abe will be seeking assurances from Theresa May about what kind of relationship the UK will have with the EU post-Brexit and that this will not be detrimental to Japanese businesses with bases in the UK. Although the UK would be leaving the single market, Mrs May told journalists she had also made clear she wanted to minimise disruption for foreign investors by putting in place transitional arrangements to ensure a \"smooth path\" after the UK leaves in 2019. She added: \"Japan is a longstanding partner of the UK with significant investments in the UK. We have seen Softbank, Toyota investing in the UK since the EU referendum took place.\" \"These are important developments for our economy and relationship with Japan.\" A special adviser to Mr Abe, Tomohiko Taniguchi, told BBC Radio 4's Today there was uneasiness about Brexit within the Japanese business community but talk of a crisis in relations was over-stated as Japanese firms had an \"inherent preference\" for doing business in Britain. Nomura bank, Hitachi and carmakers Honda, Nissan and Toyota all have bases in the UK. Earlier this year, Nissan said it would build two new models - the new Qashqai and X-Trail - at its Sunderland plant after the government promised that competitiveness would not be damaged by EU withdrawal.",

The end-of-season event gets under way on Sunday, with more than 250,000 spectators expected across eight days. Security is under review but the same measures are in place as last year, when the venue was on high alert. Jamie Murray opens play at the O2 Arena alongside doubles partner John Peers at 12:00 GMT on Sunday. \"It's obviously a terrible thing that's happened,\" said Murray. \"It's affected so many people and I guess there are a lot of shockwaves around the world that something like that can happen.\" At least 128 people were killed in attacks carried out by eight gunmen and suicide bombers in the French capital. Mahut, 33, and Herbert, 24, are making their debuts at the season finale for the best eight teams in the world. They will play Croatia's Ivan Dodig and Brazilian Marcelo Melo in their opening match at 18:00 on Monday, and hope to reflect events in their home country. \"We are discussing with the ATP to do something, at least to wear something on the shirt,\" said Mahut, who lives in Paris. \"We didn't talk with the other players but I'm sure they will do something. That is the only thing we can do and have a thought for the families, and let the politicians do what they have to do.\" The ATP confirmed \"enhanced security\" is in place and preparations continue as normal, reminding spectators that bag searches will be in place and no food or drink can be taken into the O2 Arena. The French pair watched events unfold on television in London and Herbert said they were \"still in shock\" on Saturday. \"Right now are thoughts are with the victims, the families and the guys fighting to get peace and Paris secure again,\" he said. Having confirmed that his friends and family - who live in Strasbourg - were safe, he added: \"I'm one of the lucky people, but it doesn't matter because I feel really, really touched by what is happening  right now in France. \"When it happens in your country I think the feeling is even worse. I mean, I'm scared right now. \"Yesterday we were quite happy, it's the first time for us here working in a kind of euphoria, and then you get a message, a call, and from one second to the other you're scared, you feel bad about what happened in France. \"Right now it's tough to realise because I think we're still in shock and afraid of what's happening.\" While the pair still plan to play in London, Mahut said \"tennis comes second now\" after confirming his friends and family were also safe. He said: \"Of course we were scared but I think that's what they want. \"It's not easy to talk about what happened right now. I just talked to the family and friends - I had some friends who were having dinner in the Bataclan area last night. \"At this moment we should be having fun playing the World Tour finals but today it's really complicated for us.\" The World Tour Finals is the season finale for both singles and doubles, with world number one Novak Djokovic taking on Japan's Kei Nishikori at 14:00 GMT on Sunday, followed by Roger Federer against Tomas Berdych at 20:00.",

        "article": "Touchscreen tablets and phones are popular in almost every respect but one - the smears that fingers leave on the screen. Every owner of a gadget piloted via a touchscreen has spent time rubbing it with a tissue, a cloth or a sleeve gripped round the heel of the hand to banish those unsightly marks. It's not that human fingers are filthy. Those smears come about thanks to a mix of physiology and good grooming habits, said Steve Block, an electronics industry scientist at Dow Corning, which makes coatings that get applied to touchable screens. \"There's a whole range of things that can contaminate those surfaces,\" he said. \"There are natural oils on the fingers as well as the lotions people put their hands. Then there's cosmetics and the times when you hold your telephone up to your ear and it's sweaty.\" Small wonder then that the sight of those smears is unsettling. Thankfully, there is no reason to fret, as those smears are safe if your touchscreen gadget is kept just for you, said Prof  Charles Gerba, a microbiologist at the University of Arizona. \"Touchscreens are a source of a wide range of microbes, but not much of an issue if you do not share it among other people - since, if you are the only one using it, it's only your germs,\" he told the BBC. Sadly, that is not the case when those touchscreens are put to more promiscuous use, such as in a supermarket at the self-checkout, by patients in a doctor's waiting room or in a family that passes the gadget around. Studies by Prof Gerba and colleagues have shown how important an infection vector touchscreens can be when used by lots of people. \"We have traced the spread of MRSA skin infection among teenagers that shared a cell phone,\" he said. \"You will find MRSA on touchscreens on self-checkout screens in grocery stores in the US.\" Touchscreens can be \"reservoirs of opportunistic pathogens\", said Prof Gerba in a small-scale study that uncovered MRSA, E. coli and C. difficile and many others on screens in hospitals and supermarkets. It is worth keeping those surfaces clean, said Prof Gerba, even if the chances of getting ill are pretty low. \"For viruses it can take as little one to make you ill, but this varies a lot depending on the organisms. Some bacteria take 100,000 cells to cause illness, others a few hundred,\" he said. \"It just depends if you come across the right organisms at the right time.\" The study was carried out to test the best way of keeping those screens clean and killing off the bad bugs. The good news is that wipes impregnated with sodium hypochlorite (bleach), did a good job of disinfecting the screens. However, regularly wiping with bleach might not be a solution that domestic owners of very shiny, very expensive gadgets would favour. Thankfully, other fixes are at hand. To begin with, said Mr Block, screen makers are constantly refining the materials and coatings that make gadgets easy to wipe and keep clean. Those transparent coverings are glass, he said, but of a very particular type. Typically, he said, they and the coatings covering them are engineered to the most minute scale. \"They are made of very specialised molecules that are designed for these type of applications,\" said Mr Block. The silicone coatings that are now becoming standard are far more resistant to the secretions and substances that can end up on a touchscreen. Also, said Mr Block, they are tougher and ensure a screen will stay responsive years after it is bought. There are other innovations that might help too. Japanese materials company Toray has come up with a coating that, it claims, repels up to 50% more of the oil and other residues found on fingers. In addition, once applied, the coating dries into millions of tiny wrinkles that help hide smudges to help screens stay sharp. The fourth generation of Gorilla Glass, which is used on many touchscreen gadgets, will include an antibacterial coating that can kill those pesky bugs by themselves. That coating is likely to start being used within the next couple of years. Then there is the work of scientists at Harvard University's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, who turned to a carnivorous plant to develop their screen coating. They found that the walls of the pitcher plant are slippery because they are covered with tiny bumps that trap water. Insects that can easily walk on walls struggle to make any progress on this surface because it repels the oils on their feet. By mimicking this surface and applying an ultra-thin layer of lubricant, the researchers created a surface inimical to bodily substances. The work is still in the lab but is more evidence that those screens are only going to get harder to smear and easier to use. \"Any dirt is a barrier between user experience and a display,\" said Mr Block.",
        "target": "Touchscreen devices are prone to smudges and smears from finger oils and other substances, which can harbor harmful bacteria and viruses. However, scientists are developing new materials and coatings to make screens easier to clean and resistant to smudges, including a new coating that repels oil and a surface inspired by a carnivorous plant that traps water and repels insects.",
        "filtered_resps": "Touchscreen gadgets can be contaminated with microbes, including MRSA, E. coli and C. difficile, and the smears left on the screen by fingers can be a source of these pathogens if the device is shared among multiple people. Studies have shown that touchscreens can be \"reservoirs of opportunistic pathogens\" and can spread infections easily, making it important to keep them clean. However, regularly wiping with bleach may not be practical for domestic owners of expensive gadgets, and other solutions such as screen makers refining their coatings and using new materials are being developed to keep the screens clean and easy to use.",

        "article": "Tropical storm Hagupit is heading to Manila, but has been downgraded from a typhoon after crossing the country. At least 21 people were killed by the storm, the Red Cross said, with the eastern island of Samar worst hit, but it caused far less damage than feared. Thousands of people are heading home after about a million people were evacuated from vulnerable areas. The city of Tacloban, which bore the brunt of Super Typhoon Haiyan last year, has emerged relatively unscathed. Albay province, which evacuated more than half its population, has called for those people to go home. After spending three days at a school in Polangi, families are packing into small military trucks, holding one or two plastic bags with the essentials they brought with them. They worry about the state in which they'll find their homes but many are most worried about their rice fields, their only source of income. One woman reached her house and found it flooded and uninhabitable. For her that means at least one more night in the evacuation centre. Hagupit: What did the Philippines do differently? Hagupit - pictures, tweets and videos from the Philippines In the capital, residents are preparing for heavy rain and strong winds. The typhoon is still travelling westwards across the Philippines, and has weakened into a tropical storm, according to the Philippine meteorological authorities. A government alert on Monday morning stated that residents of the capital and surrounding regions should expect winds of up to 100km/h (62mph) in the next 24 hours, and to prepare for possible flash floods, landslides, and storm surges of up to 2m. Thousands who live along the coast and riverbanks were evacuated on Monday, reports said. A total of 11.8 million people live in the national capital region. Manila Mayor Joseph Estrada said the city was \"prepared and trained for this\", but added: \"It's the flooding that we are worried about.\" Financial markets closed their doors on Monday along with schools and government offices. Flights and other public transport were halted. Hagupit has been nowhere near as powerful as Typhoon Haiyan - known as Yolanda in the Philippines - which tore through the central Philippines in November 2013, leaving more than 7,000 dead or missing. In Tacloban, Hagupit blew away roofs and flooded streets, but the area has escaped the wider devastation of last year. \"There were no bodies scattered on the road, no big mounds of debris,\" local woman Rhea Estuna told the Associated Press by phone from Tacloban. \"Thanks to God this typhoon wasn't as violent.\" Tacloban Mayor Alfred Romualdez told the BBC that the immediate task was assessing damage to the temporary shelters in which some people have been living. He said that the weather was good now but that high tides were making it harder for waterways to drain, despite work to clear debris. UN official Orla Fagan told Reuters that a lot of people have begun returning to their homes. \"In Tacloban this morning, the sun is shining, people just started going back,\" she said. The storm made its fourth landfall on Monday night, hitting Batangas province some 100km (60 miles) south of Manila with winds of roughly 100km/h. At its height, as it approached land on Saturday, gusts of up to 250km/h were recorded. The authorities said they were better prepared than when Haiyan struck, and organised the largest peacetime evacuation in the history of the Philippines. Justin Morgan, Oxfam country director for the Philippines, told the BBC that a key factor was a greater focus on the dangers of storm surges, meaning people were moved away from coastal areas. Joey Salceda, governor of Albay province, told the BBC no casualties and only \"negligible damage\" had been reported in his province. He said the storm had been identified as a threat in late November, giving officials time to identify population at risk, evacuate them two days ahead of the storm and prepare food supplies. Known locally as Typhoon Ruby, Hagupit has nonetheless caused major damage in several towns in the east. The Philippine Red Cross said at least 21 people had died over the weekend, with 18 of those on the eastern island of Samar, where Hagupit made landfall on Saturday. The mayor of Dolores, a town on Samar, said that 80% of homes there had been destroyed. One resident reportedly died after a tree fell on him. Two more people - a one-year-old girl and a 65-year-old man - died from hypothermia in the central province of Iloilo, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council said. A total of 183 flights had been cancelled and five airports closed, the agency said, and there were power outages in 16 provinces.",

Cotter will leave the Scotland job and be replaced by Glasgow boss Gregor Townsend at the end of the season. Strauss, who will start at number eight against Ireland on Saturday, says the Scotland players want to send Cotter out on a high. \"When people move on you want to give them a good send off,\" Strauss said. \"It does bring that little bit more of an incentive. You do try that little bit harder. You need emotion to play rugby and it does give you that little extra edge.\" Scotland have not won an opening day Six Nations fixture since the victory over France at Murrayfield in 2006. Their record against Ireland in the championship does not offer much cause for optimism either. Ireland have won 14 of 17 Six Nations matches between the sides. Moreover, Joe Schmidt's side have beaten South Africa, Australia and New Zealand since last summer, with Munster's CJ Stander a stand-out performer, and a player with whom Strauss is well acquainted. \"We shared a room at the Springbok camp for a week back in the day,\" Strauss said. \"He's a farmer from up north in South Africa and I'm more of a beach boy from down in the city in Cape Town. We get along well and he's a very nice guy. \"He's a very tough player. Even with the Bulls, I played for the Lions so there was a very big rivalry between our two South African teams. He was always one of the guys we watched out for. He's come over and he's done exceptionally well.\" Scotland resource coach Nathan Hines, who will follow Cotter to Montpellier in the summer, warned that Schmidt will have pinpointed every Scottish weakness ahead of the Murrayfield clash. \"He brings an unbelievable tactical awareness,\" said Hines, who played under Schmidt at Leinster. \"He goes through the other team with a fine-tooth comb and finds their weaknesses. That gives his teams confidence. \"I was across at the end of last year and spoke to him. The door is never closed with Joe, unless it is and he hasn't told me yet! He's an open guy and we had some good times with Leinster so I'm sure he'll give me a cheeky smile on Saturday before kick-off. \"They're very good at what they do. They find weaknesses and they exploit those weaknesses and make it very hard for you to play. It's about how we combat that and how we make it as difficult as possible for them to execute.\" Ireland captain and hooker Rory Best expects to wage a punishing set-piece battle with Scotland's inexperienced front-row. Edinburgh's Allan Dell, and Glasgow duo Fraser Brown and Zander Fagerson have just nine Test starts between them (three each), but 100-cap Best warns their lack of international appearances will not make for an easy ride. \"When you get that two-three link that play together every week, train together every day, it helps a lot,\" he said. \"There's no doubt that will play into their hands. \"They're inexperienced if you look in terms of Test rugby as a combination but if you look at what they've achieved individually so far this season\u2026.to go to Welford Road and dominate the way Glasgow did and the way they've been performing, we've played against them provincially and it's a very tough task scrumming down against that Glasgow scrum. \"They form two-thirds of the front row on Saturday.

The video shows three men and three unveiled women dancing to the song on the streets and rooftops of Tehran. Police chief Hossein Sajedinia said the \"vulgar clip\" had \"hurt public chastity\", the ISNA news agency said. Iran's state-run TV broadcast a programme on Tuesday, apparently showing the men and women confessing on camera. A subtitled edition of the TV clip, posted on YouTube, identified the detainees as \"actors\" who claimed they were tricked into making the Happy video for an audition. By Ali HamedaniBBC Persian The young people in the video are students, film-makers and photographers. Their video appeared during the Persian New Year, at the end of March, and it was an instant hit on Iranian social media sites, inspiring several copies. It is just the latest example of young Iranians using the internet to challenge the restrictions on their everyday lives. In the past month, hundreds of Iranian women have been defying the rules requiring them to cover their heads in public, by sending photographs of themselves without headscarves, to a newly created Facebook site called \"My Stealthy Freedom\". Arash Sobhani, leader singer of the Iranian underground rock group Kiosk, who now lives in the US told BBC Persian that the Iranian authorities continuing attempts to crackdown on \"un-Islamic\" behaviour were not working. \"They banned our music, broke our guitars, attacked our parties and stopped our concerts,\" he said. \"But did we stop? No!\" \"They told me they are making a feature film and they had a permit for it,\" said one man in the video. \"They said those things and they fooled me.\" Another young woman added: \"They had promised us not to publish the video.\" According to some unconfirmed reports, a total of 13 people were arrested in connection with the video, but official sources have not confirmed the exact number of detainees. Williams, whose song was nominated for an Oscar earlier this year, has protested at the arrests. \"It is beyond sad that these kids were arrested for trying to spread happiness,\" the singer wrote on his Facebook page. Iran's president Hassan Rouhani also appeared to criticise the arrest. A unofficial twitter account, widely believed to be associated with the President, posted a comment he first made last year, saying: \"#Happiness is our people's right. We shouldn't be too hard on behaviours caused by joy.\" Under Iran's interpretation of Islamic law, women must cover their hair and wear loose-fitting clothing meant to preserve their modesty. Patrols of so-called \"morality police\" regularly enforce standards of Islamic dress on Iran's streets. However, the rules are widely flouted. The internet is also heavily filtered in Iran, with the authorities blocking access to popular social networking sites. The \"Happy we are from Tehran\" video, originally posted in March, has now been seen more than 40,000 times. At the end of the clip, the credits read: \"Happy was an excuse to be happy. We enjoyed every second of making it. Hope it puts a smile on your face.\" Iranian journalist Golnaz Esfandiari tweeted in response to the arrests: \"Iran [is] a country where being 'happy' is a crime. \"Thousands of Iranians have been arrested in the past 35 years for being happy [and] partying.\" Arash Sobhani, leader singer of the Iranian underground rock group Kiosk, told the BBC's Persian service that attempts to suppress musicians were not working. \"They banned our music, broke our guitars, attacked our parties and stopped our concerts,\" he said. \"But did we stop? No!\" Many Twitter users have begun using the hashtag #freehappyiranians to put pressure on the Iranian authorities to release those arrested over the video. Williams' song has inspired hundreds of tributes since it was released last year on the soundtrack to hit animation Despicable Me 2. The music video lasted an exhausting 24 hours - with dozens of people filmed lip-syncing and dancing to the feel-good anthem, which was played on a loop. The clip sparked a YouTube craze, with thousands fans around the world staging their own performances of the song. When shown a montage of the tributes on the Oprah Winfrey show last month, Williams began to cry, saying the response to the song had been \"overwhelming\". In the UK, the track has reached number one on three separate occasions, while in the US it spent 10 weeks at the top of the Hot 100.",

        "article": "The Scottish government has published \"radical\" proposals aimed at widening the ownership of land across the country. It has been estimated that half of the privately-owned land in Scotland is controlled by 432 people. The Land Reform Bill will end tax relief for shooting estates and force the sale of land if owners are blocking economic development. However, it has been described as a \"land grab\" by opponents. Landowners on sporting estates stopped paying business rates in 1994 after being given an exemption by then prime minister John Major's Conservative government. The Scottish government had previously said the tax exemption was unfair and must end. It has proposed using the additional money raised by ending the tax exemption to treble the Scottish Land Fund - which is used to help support community buyouts of land - from \u00c2\u00a33m this year to \u00c2\u00a310m a year from 2016. But landowners have claimed re-introducing the rates could make some sporting estates unprofitable and force gamekeepers out of work. Nicola Sturgeon set out the land reform proposals shortly after becoming Scotland's first minister in November of last year. She said at the time that \"Scotland's land must be an asset that benefits the many, not the few\". Other proposals in the bill include: The Scottish government has set a target of doubling the amount of land in community ownership from the current 500,000 acres to one million acres by 2020. It has held a 10-week consultation on its proposals. By BBC Scotland correspondent James Cook On a dusty track just outside Islay's main settlement, Bowmore, Alasdair and Rachel Whyte are standing at a metal gate. It affords a view of the bay and the hills beyond but their eyes are on the fields in the foreground. \"The sun may be shining but there is a cloud over Islay,\" says Mrs Whyte, in a lyrical island lilt. These fields, she explains, were in her husband's family for more than a century, passed down through five generations of Whytes. They did not own the land but were tenant farmers, part of a feudal system which survives to this day. Three years ago the land here was taken off the Whyte family when Mr Whyte's sister Aileen died suddenly at the age of 47, unmarried, childless and without a will. The tenancy of the 100 acres was in her name and the law did not regard her brother as a close relative. Read more from James... David Johnstone, chairman of Scottish Land and Estates, which speaks for private landowners, had previously said that sporting estates were \"too readily singled out in a negative light\", when in fact \"they were businesses that made a key contribution to rural tourism, local employment and the environment\". And the Scottish Conservatives have also criticised the government's proposed reforms as \"a Big Brother-style land grab\". Land Reform Minister Aileen McLeod said: \"We cannot underestimate the crucial part land reform will play in contributing to the future success of communities across Scotland. \"Through the Land Reform Bill we want to ensure that future generations have access to land required to promote business and economic growth and to provide access to good quality, affordable food, energy and housing. \"The introduction of the bill is a significant step forward in ensuring our land is used in the public interest and to the benefit of the people of Scotland. It will also end the stop start nature of land reform in Scotland that has limited progress.\" Scottish Labour's environment spokeswoman Sarah Boyack said there was still unfinished business to address since Holyrood's land reform act was passed a decade ago. She explained: \"Communities in both urban and rural Scotland have much to gain from proposed new opportunities to buy and access land to further sustainable development. Crucially, this legislation will also be the opportunity to strengthen tenant farmers' rights. \"I look forward to discussing with local communities, tenant farmers and land owners how we make better use of our land to create new opportunities to regenerate communities and create new homes and jobs. We need to make sure the detail in the bill is up to the challenges we face now and in the future.\" However, the Scottish Conservatives said the SNP's land reform plan was rooted in ideology and \"will cost local jobs in rural communities\". The party's Murdo Fraser said: \"People living in rural Scotland want to see a strong economy, more jobs created, better broadband and local services improved. \"Instead, the SNP is ignoring the evidence and pursuing an ideologically-driven agenda which will jeopardise the rural economy. \"These proposals would lead to greater government interference in land ownership and an increase in the tax burden on rural businesses. \"The Scottish government has been warned that this will cost jobs, but has ignored those warnings.\"",
        "target": "The Scottish government has proposed a Land Reform Bill aimed at widening the ownership of land across the country, which includes ending tax relief for shooting estates and forcing the sale of land if owners are blocking economic development. The bill also aims to double the amount of land in community ownership and treble the Scottish Land Fund to support community buyouts of land. Private landowners have criticized the proposals, calling them a \"land grab,\" while the Scottish government argues that the reforms will contribute to the future success of communities across Scotland.",
        "filtered_resps": "The Scottish government has published proposals to widen land ownership, estimating that 432 people control half of the privately-owned land in Scotland. The Land Reform Bill will end tax relief for shooting estates and force the sale of land if owners are blocking economic development. However, it has been described as a \"land grab\" by opponents who say it could make some sporting estates unprofitable and force gamekeepers out of work.",

        "article": "John Horan easily won the vote at Congress on Friday night to become the GAA president-elect. The 58-year-old school principal from Dublin won 144 out of a possible 278 votes and was 98 ahead of his nearest rivals Sean Walsh and Frank Burke. Horan will take over from current president Aogan O Fearghail in 2018. \"Aogan is the president for the next 12 months so I'll support him and learn from him as best I can,\" said Horan at Croke Park. The other candidates for the post were Martin Skelly with 22 votes while 20 went to Robert Frost. This weekend's annual congress will be dominated by new championship proposals in football and hurling. The plans put forward by GAA director general Paraic Duffy include completing the All-Ireland Senior Championships by the end of August. Also included is a new round-robin format for the All-Ireland SFC quarter-finals, which would mean more games. This proposal has proved particularly controversial in recent weeks. Both the Gaelic Players' Association and recently formed Club Players' Association have come out against Duffy's plans, although not necessarily for the same reasons. Ostensibly, the main reason for these mooted changes is to try and ensure more regular games for club players but there is a certain  amount of bafflement as to how this can be squared with the motion to have a round-robin stage in the All-Ireland Football quarter-finals. The new club players' body has been angered after the GAA's top brass refused to grant it a speaking platform at the Croke Park gathering. However, that may change at further annual gatherings of GAA delegates if a motion for the club players' body to be officially recognised is passed in Dublin. All the indications are that the votes on both the so-called new 'Super Eight football round' and the proposal to bring forward the All-Ireland finals will be exceptionally close, with a two-thirds' majority required for the format changes to be tried for a three-year period. To make matters even complicated, congress will also hear a number of motions calls from the two-thirds majority to be scrapped, with one call suggestion a simple majority and another calling for the figure to be lowered to 60%. Inevitably, those motions will require a two-thirds majority to be passed. Going into the weekend, Croke Park's desire for replays to be scrapped - in favour of extra-time - in all championship games bar provincial and All-Ireland finals looks likely to be comfortably passed. At last year's congress, motions to move All-Ireland Finals to earlier in the year and scrap replays were both defeated, although the finals proposal fell narrowly short after getting support from 60.8% of delegates.",

        "article": "It is certainly not the country's most famous sporting event but the Scottish Boat Race is one of the oldest. The competition which takes place on the Clyde this weekend, between Glasgow and Edinburgh Universities, was first staged 140 years ago. It is the third oldest race of its kind in the world, just behind Oxford-Cambridge and the Yale-Harvard Regatta in the United States. Preparing for the race means lots of early morning training sessions. One such dawn chorus greeted the Glasgow University rowers as they arrived for their 06:45 session on the river Clyde by Glasgow Green. Those taking part are students from a wide variety of courses but they are linked by a passion for rowing. The first Scottish boat race took place on the River Clyde in 1877. Both Edinburgh and Glasgow University rowing clubs were formed 10 years earlier than that, so it is a rivalry which is more than a decade older than that of football's Old Firm of Celtic and Rangers. In an extraordinary winning streak Glasgow won every year between 2000 and 2012 but for the past four years Edinburgh has triumphed. Glasgow 1st VIII captain Gavin Shields says they have been working hard to regain their form. He says: \"We've had a really good few years of developing some guys coming straight from beginner level. \"It's definitely a work in progress. Edinburgh have have some really good results but it just makes us work harder to try to beat them.\" Gavin is studying psychology but the person who really has to get inside the heads of the crew is the 1st VIII cox and French student Rebecca Vest. She is the lone woman in the men's boat. Rebecca says: \"You are one of the team but you are also in charge. \"You have to make sure you have that respect which is earned throughout the year. \"Sometimes it's difficult and it might take some months before some people in your crew accept your role and trust you to do your job properly.\" Glasgow's Women's 1st VIII won their race last year and the university's club captain and chemistry student Stuart Mitchell says the men are on course to win again in the future. He says: \"People who take part in the sport are incredibly passionate about it and there's a lot of self starters in the club. \"I think the club is only going to get bigger and better.\" Meanwhile at Scottish Rowing's impressive facility at Strathclyde Park near Hamilton athletes from Edinburgh University arrive for their training session well aware there are quite a few rising stars among their ranks. The standard is high, reflected in the recent selection of Maddie Arlett from the Women's 1st VIII for British Rowing's GB World Cup team. And of course another woman - five time Olympic medal winner Katherine Grainger - began her extraordinary rowing career while at Edinburgh. On the men's side Josh Armstrong, a first year sports management student, has a long term ambition to compete at the Tokyo Olympics in 2020. But in the more immediate future he is aiming to extend the winning streak of Edinburgh's 1st VIII over Glasgow from four years to five. Josh says: \"This is the first time I'm going to be competing in it so I'm really looking forward to it. \"The rivalry will be massive as both universities are in a really strong place just now. \"But I think we'll be looking to get the win and would be slightly disappointed if we didn't get that.\" Some rowers like Josh are part of the university's elite performance sport department but coach Colin Williamson, who heads up Performance Rowing, insists that is only part of the explanation for Edinburgh's recent success. He says: \"I don't really think there is a secret to it. We just put it down to hard work. \"The guys train very hard and they train very consistently. \"And with the good support services we have at Edinburgh, with our strength and conditioning and physio and Scottish Rowing and Sport Scotland, everything is there for the guys to reach their full potential.\" Last year Glasgow's women beat Edinburgh and the crew from the east coast are determined to settle that score this time round. Medical student Laura McDonald who coxes Edinburgh women's 1st VIII says the team is a better unit than before. She says: \"I think there is a better bond within the crew this year. \"Last year people were frustrated and there seemed to be something missing. This year everyone is in it together.\" The approaches of both teams to the sport might be slightly different but they match each other in their desire to win. When they meet on the Clyde beside the Riverside Museum on Saturday they will bring with them 300 years of history as rowing clubs, not to mention 140 years of the Scottish boat race itself which is the third oldest in the world. That is rather a lot of water under the bridge.",
