        "article": "Not surprisingly, President Obama and Speaker John Boehner have different views on energy policy, differences brought into stark contrast by their recent statements. The president sees our nation's energy policy primarily in terms of the environment, with the economy a secondary concern. His policy is grounded in a view that government regulation and subsidies can steer us to better and cleaner energy. On Tuesday the president unveiled plans to increase regulation of coal-fired electricity plants, erect new hurdles to building the Keystone pipeline, and further the federal government's role in trying to pick winners and losers in energy sources. Mr. Boehner calls energy \"one of our best opportunities for robust and sustained growth . . . our new economic frontier, just as the Internet was in the 1990s.\" This debate's timing could not be more appropriate, because the right energy policy could be the catalyst needed to inject some growth into our weak economy and raise standards of living, not just in this country, but across the world. We see significant progress across the energy spectrum. On the supply side, there are new approaches to developing and scaling up renewable energy, as well as safely and economically extracting energy from natural gas, oil and coal. This progress often happens in spite of government policy. The boom in natural gas production, stymied on federal lands, is happening on private property. The demand side is equally encouraging. Overall world-wide demand continues to increase, but that's a sign of a successfully growing world, with more schools, hospitals and jobs, and less poverty, disease and premature death. New and more efficient technologies allow us to feed this beneficial growth more effectively. In the U.S., energy consumption per dollar of real gross domestic product has declined almost a third in the past two decades and is projected to decline another third over the next two decades. The domestically sourced share of our energy consumption is rising, and this trend is expected to continue. Advances in extraction technologies such as hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling have yielded continued gains in production of oil and natural gas. We see continued efforts in cleaner coal, which is important since coal is currently used to generate around 40% of our electricity and we have enough to supply 200 years of demand. While fossil fuels will be our primary energy sources for several decades, we need progress in renewables so they can eventually supplant today's fossil fuels. Again, we see good news. Look at just one recent issue of Popular Science, where we see more-efficient solar and wind technology and a possible nonbattery alternative for the energy storage critical for such renewables. Other promising technologies include energy from waste, fueling nuclear plants with spent nuclear fuel (instead of having to store such waste), using heat generated from industrial processes to create electricity, and drawing energy from waves and tidal movements. All of which means the talk in recent decades about energy shortages will again be proved wrong, as all such Malthusian predictions have. Such defeatism misses the mark because it fails to account for the incredible impact of human ingenuity and man's unceasing search for something better. In short, we can see an incredibly bright energy future on the horizon. Unless, that is, overbearing government bureaucrats and misguided environmental interest groups get in the way. Unfortunately, there is a real chance of that happening. Energy producers are faced with the delay and costs from government's slowness in granting permits and its proclivity for issuing new regulations, by environmental group court challenges, and by the left's almost surreal ability to reject any energy source that becomes viable\u2014even windmills in their backyards. Well-intentioned subsidies for renewables reduce the chance for success, since producers learn to live off the subsidies and have less incentive to produce feasible technology. Businesses and consumers feel the impact as energy costs increase. The policies the president announced Tuesday are more of the same. Less government control and meddling would instead unleash the technologists and risk-takers to give us more energy, a stronger economy and a safer and healthier environment.",

        "article": "Last week an article appeared on the Web site of Editor & Publisher, which is a magazine for journalists that also has a Web site, as you would expect. This article, by Jennifer Saba, a writer whose work I am not familiar with, although that is not intended in any way as an insult, reported that one Randy Michaels, who is described as chief operating officer of the Tribune Co., a media corporation based in Chicago that owns the Chicago Tribune (the company's flagship newspaper, and indeed the one the company is named after) as well as the Los Angeles Times, some TV stations, and the Chicago Cubs Major League Baseball team, among other properties, had told the business community in its so-called \"conference call\" (a Wall Street ritual in which financial analysts and others are given an oral report on how a company is doing, so they can repeat this information to their customers) that the Tribune Co. intends to address the ongoing distress of the newspaper industry brought on by the Internet -- distress that already has led to massive layoffs and buyouts and a major crisis of confidence if not identity at even the most prestigious and established and, one would have thought, profitable newspapers -- by starting to measure the productivity of the journalists who are employed at the various tentacles of that institution. And not only that: Productivity will be measured by column-inches of words. In other words, the company will assume that the more words you write, the more productive you are. Or, to put it another way, if you use many, many, many words to make whatever point you may be trying to make or fact you are attempting to report, you will be considered more productive than another writer who takes pains to be concise -- that is, to use fewer words rather than more words. This Michaels has apparently been sneaking around with his tape measure (or perhaps he uses an old-fashioned pica rule of the sort once favored by newspaper people during the era of the linotype machine) and has made the piquant discovery that while the average journalist at the Los Angeles Times produces 51 pages of words each year, his or her counterpart at the Hartford Courant, which is also owned by the very same Tribune Co., produces 300 pages of words each year. This is six times as many words. Or, to put it another way (and why not?), the Los Angeles Times journalist produces only one-sixth as many words as the one working in the newsroom of the Hartford Courant. Michaels is completely unabashed, in fact he seems downright proud, of this idea of measuring productivity in column-inches. He said to Editor & Publisher, \"This is a new thing. Nobody ever said, 'How many column inches did someone produce?' \" For many, many years, the Los Angeles Times was known for its verbosity, or tendency to use more words than other newspapers to say roughly the same thing. More recently, this habit of writing many, many words when far fewer could make the point as well or nearly so (which is the essence of verbosity) was discouraged at the Los Angeles Times. It is no longer like the old days, when stories used to jump from one page to another, and then to yet another, and then another still, snaking endlessly around ads -- this was back when newspapers had ads -- and rarely reached a conclusion except for an announcement that Part XIII would appear the next day. But apparently this new discipline was a terrible, terrible mistake. Or, to put it a different way, it was a bad idea. At any rate, it is yesterday's idea. Today's idea is that a writer should produce as many words as possible, because that means you need fewer writers to produce the same number of words. But wait. There's more. It has not escaped the attention of the Tribune Co. that there is a second way to reduce the need for reporters and writers -- and paper and ink as well -- which is to publish fewer words. According to Michaels, there should be an equal number of pages devoted to advertising and pages devoted to reporting and opinion. \"What you find out is that you can take 500 editorial pages a week out of [a] newspaper and have a 50-50 ad-content ratio.\" Five hundred pages a week would be about 25,000 pages a year, according to reliable newspaper industry sources. If the average Los Angeles Times journalist produces 51 pages a year, as Michaels has calculated, this means that a 50-50 ratio will allow him to lay off 500 Los Angeles Times journalists, which is more than half of the current staff. Then, if he can persuade the remaining Los Angeles Times journalists to raise their productivity from 50 pages to 300 pages a year, he can dismiss five-sixths of the rest. That would leave something like 50 journalists to put out the Los Angeles Times every day. For now. As long as advertising pages continue to decline -- and there is every reason to hope that they will continue to -- editorial pages can be reduced as well, and more and more journalists can be let go in order to maintain the crucial 50-50 ratio of advertising to content. This Michaels is clearly a bright man. It won't be long before he figures out that you can have an equal number of advertising and editorial pages if you have none of either and simply stop publishing the paper. That way you won't have to employ any journalists at all. So, that's 1,003 words. Can I go to lunch now? Michael Kinsley is a columnist for Time and washingtonpost.com.",

        "article": "A two-year boom in residential real estate construction \u2014 focused almost exclusively on luxury homes for wealthy renters \u2014 is about to test the limits of Boston\u2019s demand for ultra- high-priced apartment living. More than 8,000 units are expected to be built in the city during the next three years. The unprecedented burst of construction will double the supply of units built in large, luxury complexes since 1960, according to the real estate firm JLL. The new buildings feature everything from yoga lounges to swank roof decks, and their apartments come at a hefty price. At Avalon Exeter, a tower rising in the Back Bay, one-bedroom units with 800 square feet start at $4,000 a month. At the recently completed 315 on A Street in South Boston, slightly smaller apartments are available for $3,700. Live there with your pet and the rent can go up another $100 per month. \u201cThe big question everyone has is, is the [luxury] market deep enough?\u201d said David Begelfer, chief executive of NAIOP Massachusetts, a commercial real estate association. \u201cWe know there is tremendous demand at various income levels, but all the production is aimed at the higher end of the market.\u201d The sudden construction boom is driven by several factors. Boston\u2019s population increased 3.1 percent, to more than 636,000, between 2010 and late 2012, but hardly any new apartments were built during that period due to lingering weakness in the economy. An existing imbalance between supply and demand grew wider and caused average rents to jump about 20 percent, according to JLL. That made new towers even more attractive to investors. In downtown alone, a dozen large apartment buildings are under construction. Apartments were also a popular development choice because lenders considered them less risky following the nation\u2019s housing collapse. Now, as the market recovers, condominium buildings are also being built, adding to the development pipeline. \u201cThis type of residential construction hasn\u2019t been seen in Boston since the 1800s, when the Back Bay, Beacon Hill, and the South End were built,\u201d said John B. Hynes III, chief executive of the development firm Boston Global Investors. \u201cWe don\u2019t have that same kind of population explosion today, but we do have growth.\u201d Given Boston\u2019s limited supply of modern rentals \u2014 nearly half the city\u2019s apartments pre-date World War II \u2014 Begelfer and most other real estate specialists believe the apartments under construction will be filled before long. Still, even aggressive investors, such as the development firm Gerding Edlen, are recalibrating their approach as the first wave of units begins to reach the market. \u201cThere\u2019s only so many times you can be successful being the most expensive building in town,\u201d said Kelly Saito, president of the Portland, Ore.-based company, which is also building projects in Chicago and San Francisco. The company completed the 315 on A tower last year and is now part of a team constructing a 378-unit complex in the South End. But now the firm is planning to construct its next building on the less developed \u2014 and more affordable \u2014 East Boston waterfront. \u201cWe\u2019re thinking about unique locations, timing, and how can we deliver these for a price other than the new high- water mark,\u201d Saito said. But he said rents there will not offer a deep discount from the downtown luxury market. Those units may be offered for $200 to $400 a month less, said Saito. Despite high demand for moderately priced homes in Boston, it is hard to build them due to high land prices and ever-rising construction costs. Builders also must charge rents that will achieve profits promised to investors. A few developers have been able to produce lower-cost housing by developing projects in neighborhoods outside downtown. For example, Mount Vernon Co. quickly filled a 500-unit complex in Allston called the Green District, where one-bedroom units rent for about $2,100 a month. The company\u2019s chairman, Bruce Percelay, is among those skeptical that developers building downtown are going to find enough tenants to pay luxury rents. \u201cAt the outset I think it\u2019s going to be a little rocky,\u201d he said. \u201cThis huge supply of luxury units is going to be delivered simultaneously, and that\u2019s going to create a lot of competitive pressure.\u201d Some of the early entrants to the market are already offering concessions. At the Kensington, a 381-unit apartment tower on Washington Street in downtown Boston, project executives are offering incentives that include two months\u2019 free rent on a 24-month lease and reduced broker fees. Even with those incentives, the rents aren\u2019t cheap. A 578-square-foot one bedroom in the complex still costs about $2,700 a month, according to a recent advertisement distributed to brokers. About 61 percent of the building\u2019s units have been leased to date, a spokeswoman for the project said. The competition for luxury renters will probably become even tougher over the next few years. About 1,250 units are expected to hit the market this year, followed by more than 3,100 others next year and another 3,660 in 2016. Together, the supply in those three years will more than double the number of units built in large buildings since 1960. Hynes, the Boston Global Investors executive, said the flurry of activity will not undermine his plans to start construction this June on another 850-unit complex of apartments in the South Boston Innovation District. If anything, he said, the development of residential buildings such as 315 on A and a tower rising at Pier 4 will only strengthen the area\u2019s appeal. He expects there will be plenty of demand for more apartments by the time his building opens in 2017. \u201cWe\u2019re more bullish about our positioning in the marketplace because of the location that\u2019s evolving in the seaport,\u201d Hynes said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to capture more than our fair share of prospective renters going forward.\u201d",

        "article": "Visitors to the Alamo will get a rare glimpse next year of the \"Victory or Death\" letter penned 177 years ago by the head of the outnumbered Texas forces while under bombardment by Mexican government troops. The State Library and Archives Commission voted Wednesday to allow the fragile, fading letter written by Col. William Barret Travis to be displayed at the Alamo for the anniversary of the two-week battle that ended on March 6, 1836. The commission originally decided against the loan but later reconsidered. State archivists had recommended against transporting the letter to San Antonio and putting it on display. Light has already bleached the original letter, making it difficult to read and the paper extremely fragile. The letter is kept in a dark vault in Austin. But Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson told the commission Wednesday he thought displaying the letter for the first time at the Alamo would attract tremendous interest in Texas history. \"There is a balance between preservation and public access,\" he said. \"In my view, in every Texans' lifetime there should be one opportunity to see this in person.\" The commission chairman, Michael Waters, pointed out that the letter was placed on display at the state library in Austin on the anniversaries of the siege in 2010 and 2011. The main topic of Wednesday's hearing centered on providing security for the letter, not whether the travel or the exposure would harm it. Patterson said he'd received a commitment from the director of the Department of Public Safety to provide all necessary measure to protect the letter. He described how state troops would transport the letter in an armed convoy, likely with air support, to and from the Alamo. Only retired state archivist David Gracy voiced opposition to loaning out the letter. In the 1960s, Gracy tried but failed to convince then-Gov. Price Daniels not to display the letter under a bright light around the clock, and Gracy believes most of the damage to the letter happened during this period. \"It is vitally important to protect this letter, as it is to protect all of the archives for not just this moment, no matter how important it is for us, but for the entire future,\" he said. \"You have a professional staff of the highest quality who knows what needs to be done to protect this letter.\" Travis was a South Carolina-born Alabama lawyer and militiaman who fled to Texas when it was still part of Mexico. He resumed his law practice in Texas and became an ardent advocate of revolution against Mexico. He gathered reinforcements for a militia detachment occupying the Alamo, a former mission church in Bexar, the future San Antonio. Under attack from a much larger Mexican force under the command of Gen. Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, Travis wrote the letter on Feb. 24, 1836. In it, he stated that his men had been under Mexican bombardment for 24 hours, and that Santa Anna had given the Texans the ultimatum to surrender or \"be put to the sword.\" \"I have answered the demand with a cannon shot, & and our flag still waves proudly from the walls \u2014 I shall never retreat or surrender,\" Travis wrote. He concludes: \"If this call is neglected, I am determined to sustain myself as long as possible & die like a soldier who never forgets what is due to his own honor & that of his country \u2014 Victory or Death.\" A courier managed to sneak the letter out, and it was published in leaflets and newspapers throughout the U.S. The volunteers came, but not in time. Santa Anna's forces stormed the Alamo on March 6 and overwhelmed and killed its defenders. The volunteers joined the troops under Sam Houston's command and defeated Santa Anna at the April 22 Battle of San Jacinto near present-day Houston, securing Texas independence until its annexation by the United States in 1845. According to the state library website, the letter was returned to the Travis family shortly thereafter. In 1893, his great-grandson sold it for $85 to the Texas state government. It was placed in the state library upon its creation in 1909. Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatino Like us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino",

        "article": "Through rain, sleet and even vortexes, District bikers don\u2019t quit. A bundled-up bicyclist crosses Key Bridge on Thursday morning. (Matt McClain/ The Washington Post) In response to writer Ashley Halsey\u2019s report on intrepid cyclists \u2013 and their determination to stick to two wheels even in winter \u2013 several commenters shared their tips for cold-weather cycling. Got your own tips for cycling through snow? Have these inspired you to brave the flurries on your Schwinn? Let us know in the comments. \u201cCold\u2019s not a problem. I commuted by bike 5 of the last 7 days this week. Snow pants & fleece, a fleece cap under the helmet, the right gloves, & you\u2019re fine. Rain\u2019s not a problem, either, as long as you have waterproofs. Wind is a problem. Of course, the biggest threat is still drivers.\u201d \u2014 musician1 \u201cI bike 20-26 miles a day, year round, and find the trick is to get on the bike every [sic] unless there\u2019s a downpour or ice. The body adjusts to the change in temperatures. After a few days leaving the house when the temperature was 5 degrees, today\u2019s mid-20s feels like shorts weather. I normally take the Capital Crescent Trail, but with snow on the ground, I can safely take a lane on slow-moving Connecticut Ave during rush hour without slowing anybody down. One other suggestion: A strip of velcro holds a blinking red light on the back of my helmet and I use a tiny rechargeable light on top facing forward to make sure that cars can see me in the dark.\u201d \u2014 marionPark \u201cOne synthetic neck protector you can wear over your head and cheeks will do wonders and you don\u2019t [need] much more. With the right equipment [it] can be as enjoyable as skiing or any other winter outdoor activity, and it\u2019s a great way to start and end the day. (Frankly, I\u2019d be downright unhealthy were it not for my commute).\u201d \u2014 Justafan \u201cI was a little nervous that 7-degree day, never having biked in that kind of cold before, but it was really fine. The right gear was key for me. The ice on the trails is difficult, but I\u2019m fortunate enough to be able to use neighborhood streets as a workaround when needed. Arlington has been doing some salting and plowing on the Custis trail too. While not expected, it is appreciated, even if salt isn\u2019t my favorite thing to get on a bike.\u201d \u2014 huskerDE \u201cI bike commute 2-3 times a week from Arlington to Capitol Hill regardless of the temperature. I find that being outside that much has actually helped me to have fewer colds. Obviously biking is great for your cardiovascular health, but biking in the cold also seems to build your resistance to colds.\u201d \u2014 skronzek \u201cI think most [people] figure out the cold. If it\u2019s too cold, they probably just stop somewhere along the way to warm up (e.g., CVS). Same thing with my nose running. Many cyclists call it perfecting the art of the snot rocket. Except I notice it basically at any temperature below 50. No frostbite for me on ~15 miles each way although I fully admit to stopping the one day when my glove just wasn\u2019t doing the trick. \u2026 People don\u2019t have to ride into work like many of us do, but it\u2019s good for them to see that the option exists. National Bike to Work Day comes up in May, and it\u2019s a great time for people who are thinking about trying this (even to a Metro stop) to give it a shot. Some of us more experienced folks will guide folks in at a pace everyone can do. And it\u2019s a great oppotunity to see what it\u2019s all about. Don\u2019t bang it until you try it. It\u2019s easy to make excuses, but many of us will tell you that once you start riding, your excuses become why to ride to your spouse/friends/family rather than why not to ride. Give it a try.\u201d \u2014 TerpAlum \u201cOne nice thing about bicycles is that they are inexpensive compared to cars. Many people who are car-free can afford to keep more than one bike around, like a speedy commuter and a slower \u201cgrocery store\u201d bicycle. I have three bicycles (the third is a travel/touring bike) and keep snow tires on my commuter bike in the winter (on snow-free, ice-free winter days I ride my touring bike). The snow tires are slower than regular tires but make all the difference. It helps that the Wilson Bridge path is plowed when it snows. We need to plow other commuter trails as well, like they do in other cities. There is no need for DC to be behind the times when it comes to transportation and public health.\u201d \u2014 Jonathan_Krall \u201cI think the threshold varies by individual. Whenever I rode with the temperature much below 70 I would wind up with coughing fits related to asthma. But I was good to go above that, and for me the optimal temperature was between about 90 and 94, where my body didn\u2019t need to waste any energy keeping my internal temperature up. Above 95 or so it got so the wind no longer provided much cooling and I would have to take more rests. The longest I ever rode nonstop was 322 miles, but I would try to get in a century every day I had off (and would get in 30 to 50 miles every day I had to work, riding at least from my home in Dranesville to my job at Main Justice downtown and back and everywhere else I had to go). I just LOVED that hill down to Difficult Run on Old Georgetown Pike, although cars would sometimes get in my way.\u201d \u2014 FergusonFoont \u201cI bike commute (from Arl, about 8 mi) frequently. It\u2019s really refreshing \u2014 a great way to wake up in the morning, and to leave work behind in the evening. I also keep a fold-up bike in my office (so I don\u2019t have to get fully geared up) for running around downtown during the day \u2014 so much faster and easier than any other way of getting around, and a lot more fun. I don\u2019t enjoy riding much below 40 when there\u2019s potential for ice or brain freeze, so I don\u2019t, but more power to those who do.\u201d \u2014 zekepeterz And some final encouragement from frequent commenter DCB23: \u201cIt can be done! I started riding from Cap Hill to Foggy Bottom for work three years ago and I have not missed a single day\u2026polar vortex and snowpocalypse included.\u201d",

The boy, Mahaj Brown, was hit with at least 10 bullets, but is expected to recover despite wounds to his left leg and chest. Police said more than 50 shell casings have been recovered from what they describe as a \u201crunning gun battle\u201d. Multiple buildings and vehicles were also damaged in the incident. It is believed that at least one of the gunmen was wielding an AK-47 assault rifle during the shooting in the city\u2019s Germantown neighborhood. \u201cHe was going home to go to bed, from his grandmother\u2019s house to his mother\u2019s house. And to get caught with assault rifles?\u201d Mahaj\u2019s grandmother Delores Melendez told ABC 6 in Philadelphia. Mahaj was in a car with a 32-year-old man that family identified as the boy\u2019s godfather when the shots began. The 32-year-old was also struck, treated and released from the hospital. Melendez said the boy remained conscious through the entire ordeal and said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe I was shot. I can\u2019t believe I was shot.\u201d The shooting marks the second time a young child has been seriously injured by stray gunfire in the city just this week. On Tuesday six-year-old Anila Garrick was hit by a bullet as she played in front of her home. Garrick remained at the same children\u2019s hospital where Brown was being treated on Friday morning, and doctors said she is recovering rapidly. Although surveillance footage was released by police in the Tuesday shooting, no suspects have been identified in either incident. The predominantly black neighborhood of Germantown has struggled, not unlike other neighborhoods in the city, to maintain productive relationships between police and residents. This often leads to few criminal leads in cases like this where residents may be hesitant to tip police off to the possible identity of the shooters. \u201cSpeak up and say something,\u201d Melendez said. \u201cPeople\u2019s children are dying for no reason. My grandbaby is up there suffering for what? He did nothing.\u201d Unlike many large US cities like New York and Washington, which saw large upswings in violent crime during the late 1980s and early 1990s, followed by precipitous drops during the late 90s, Philadelphia\u2019s homicide rate has been relatively stable over the past 30 years. The city has seen an average of more than 320 homicides a year over the last decade.",

Let the record reflect that on June 8, 2010, instant replay firmly became part of the N.B.A.\u2019s signature event. Referees consulted the replay monitor three times in the final 89 seconds of Game 3 between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Boston Celtics \u2014 each time to determine possession after a ball went out of bounds. Two calls were changed. The third call was upheld. The night ended with a 91-84 Lakers victory and a recognition that the finals had changed for good. \u201cIn terms of a key situation in a finals game, I think definitely, replay\u2019s arrived in that regard,\u201d said Stu Jackson, the league\u2019s executive vice president for basketball operations, adding, \u201cI think that they did very well and used the system appropriately.\u201d A week ago, Major League Baseball was consumed by a debate over the need for replay, after a blown call by the umpire Jim Joyce ruined a perfect game by Detroit Tigers pitcher Armando Galarraga. Ultimately, Commissioner Bud Selig ruled in favor of human error over cold technology and rejected pleas to overturn the call. But the N.B.A., like the N.F.L., is unabashedly pro-pixel. Commissioner David Stern is a fierce advocate of replay and is constantly pushing to expand its use. The N.B.A. introduced replay eight years ago, initially to review only baskets (and, in some instances, fouls) that occurred at the end of a period, with time expiring. Now referees now can review everything from clock malfunctions to shot-clock situations and whether a field goal was a 2-pointer or a 3-pointer. Replay generally remains a small and unobtrusive part of the N.B.A. game. It took a new wrinkle and a unique chain of events to make it a featured player Tuesday night. This season, for the first time, referees were authorized to use replay to determine who touched a ball last before it went out of bounds, albeit in limited circumstances: the final two minutes of the fourth quarter and the final two minutes of overtime periods. It rarely came up in the regular season. According to Jackson, officials reviewed 68 calls and overturned 25, for a rate of 36.8 percent, the highest in any replay category \u2014 \u201cwhich really speaks to just how difficult those plays are,\u201d Jackson said. In what can only be called a fluke, there have already been four such instances in the finals, including three in the final 1 minute 29 seconds of Game 3: \u00b6With the Lakers leading by 84-80, Kobe Bryant and Lamar Odom double-teamed Garnett, and Bryant slapped at the ball, sending it over the baseline with 1:29 left. Possession was initially awarded to the Celtics. Officials reversed the call after determining that the ball hit Garnett\u2019s leg before going out of bounds. \u00b6Nineteen seconds later, with the score unchanged, the ball sailed out of bounds after Odom and Rajon Rondo battled for a rebound. Unsure who touched the ball last, officials initially called for a jump ball. After consulting replay, they determined that Odom was the culprit and awarded possession to the Celtics. \u00b6With the Lakers leading by 87-82, Odom and Rondo again battled for a loose ball, which sailed out of bounds with 39 seconds left. Officials ruled that Odom touched it last, a judgment that was confirmed by the video review. The Celtics got the ball. However, that last review highlighted a loophole in the system. Odom indeed touched the ball last, but replays clearly showed Rondo slapping him on the arm. No foul was called. And under the league\u2019s strict replay guidelines, referees were not permitted to call it after the fact. In the view of Lakers Coach Phil Jackson, that raises concerns. \u201cYou\u2019re going to face that if you\u2019re just going to use videotape one way,\u201d he said. \u201cThose are the things that we questioned immediately when they brought in the rule, is you\u2019re going to see a lot of things happening now\u201d on a given play that were not called. He suggested that the rule might need refinement. Celtics Coach Doc Rivers questioned the Garnett-Bryant ruling, saying he thought the video was inconclusive and that the original call, which awarded the ball to Boston, should have stood. But in general, both teams seemed satisfied with the system and the results. \u201cThe replays have been great,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cI like it, I love it.\u201d The Celtics\u2019 Ray Allen, echoing the consensus, said, \u201cAs long as they get it right, whatever it takes.\u201d In fact, some players said, if the league allows replay to judge out-of-bounds balls in the final two minutes, it should allow it in the other 46 minutes as well. \u201cBecause they don\u2019t get every call right the first three quarters,\u201d Rondo said. League officials discussed those concerns when they drafted the replay rules, Stu Jackson said. They also considered whether a foul could be called retroactively, as in the Rondo-Odom play. But they are determined to keep the uses narrowly defined and to stay away from judgment calls, such as fouls. There will always be loopholes, exceptions and what-ifs, but the N.B.A. likes its replay with set limits. \u201cIf you let your mind go,\u201d Jackson said, \u201cyou end up in this place where you say, \u2018Let\u2019s review every play.\u2019 That\u2019s not a place we want to be.\u201d",

But you\u2019ve got to be careful. When people in Washington say they\u2019re lowering taxes, hold onto your wallet.\u201d Romney said Obama\u2019s plan would keep taxes at the same level for many Americans while raising taxes on what he called \u201cjob creators and small businesses.\u201d Romney cast the plan as \u201cthe sort of thing only an extreme liberal could come up with.\u201d \u201cThis old-style liberalism of bigger-and-bigger government and bigger-and-bigger taxes has got to end, and we will end it in November,\u201d Romney said, drawing loud applause from a crowd of about 900 people inside a high school gymnasium. Obama campaign spokeswoman Lis Smith responded to Romney\u2019s appearance in a statement that said, \u201cMitt Romney just doesn\u2019t get it.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a stark difference between where he and President Obama want to take this country,\u201d Smith\u2019s statement said, adding: \u201cThe American people deserve a President who will fight to create jobs here in America, not the Outsourcer-in-Chief Mitt Romney promises to be.\u201d Romney took a wide assortment of questions from supporters here, over second amendment gun rights (he said he supports them), abortion rights (he said he opposes them) and criminal justice (he said he favors the death penalty). One questioner, in a reference to the Democrats\u2019 recent focus on Romney\u2019s personal wealth, asked Romney why the Obama campaign and the media \u201cwant us to think that we should be more angry with what you do with your money than what Obama has done with mine?\u201d Romney responded by saying, \u201cI\u2019m not going to apologize for success at home, and I\u2019m not going to apologize for America abroad. And, yeah, I went out and began a business, and the business turned out to be far more successful than I ever would have imagined.\u201d Romney told another questioner that he believes he faces a biased national media, saying, \u201cI realize, now and then, I\u2019m fighting an uphill battle in some organs of the national media.\u201d Although many conservatives often complain of biased media \u2014 this became a theme in John McCain\u2019s 2008 campaign \u2014 Romney rarely talks about such matters. A third questioner asked him, \u201cHow are you planning on fighting the fourth wing of the Democratic Party, which is the media?\u201d The man added that Republicans \u201cneed a fighter out there,\u201d and he suggested Rep. Allen West (R-Fla.), a provocative freshman with tea party roots, as Romney\u2019s running mate. \u201cI\u2019ve been listening to Allen West talk,\u201d the man told Romney. \u201cHe\u2019d make a great vice president. He\u2019s a fighter, and that\u2019s what we want.\u201d Romney responded simply, saying, \u201cThank you. All suggestions are welcome.\u201d",

Why do people need more shops?\u201d Caroline, in Bar Italia, is one of the many people who never went to Madame Jojo\u2019s, mourning the end of Madame Jojo\u2019s. \u201cWell, it\u2019s iconic, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said Bernie Katz, a Soho icon himself, the gatekeeper of the Groucho club. He corrected his tense. \u201cIt was a landmark. It\u2019s true, Soho is changing. It\u2019s faster, it\u2019s not as relaxed. But you just have to put your skates on and go with it.\u201d Opinion in this little grid of streets, and possibly in the world, divides squarely between neophiles and neophobes, optimists and pessimists. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s changed at all,\u201d said Michelle Wade, proprietor of Maison Bertaux, London\u2019s oldest and most enchanting patisserie. \u201cIn so far as, it was always changing. When my uncle was a registrar at University College Hospital, they used to race down here to have a quick dance and a drink, in the Blitz. Then, of course, there was the Dylan Thomas, Lucien Freud era \u2026\u201d These are two Sohos I feel suddenly mournful not to have experienced. \u201cWell,\u201d she said kindly, \u201ceveryone misses a train sometimes.\u201d Costas, 48, is honcho of the wonderful Arts Theatre Club, open six nights a week until three in the morning, but only (mainly) to chorus girls. \u201cThe people that work in theatre, they work really hard and they play really hard, and I don\u2019t think they make a lot of money, and they spend it all in here.\u201d It is unlike any other bar you will ever go to, with a very real chance that people will start singing (properly) halfway through the night. \u201cIn 10 years\u2019 time, there will be no independents left in Soho,\u201d he said, laying that squarely with the two main landlords, Shaftesbury and Soho Estates. \u201cThey\u2019ve basically bought out Soho and are trying to get rid of all the little men. They prefer chains.\u201d Bang opposite, literally and in viewpoint, is Martin Morales, the chef at Ceviche, a cracking little Peruvian restaurant that distils the new Soho, in which food is the new sex. There must be a cultural message in this somewhere, but I\u2019m not sure what it is. \u201cI think it\u2019s amazing. It\u2019s the centre of the universe. I am here all the time, I am here in the kitchen, I am walking the streets, looking at what is happening. I still see all the detail of the characters, people expressing themselves in unique ways. The exciting thing is chain restaurants and overly branded businesses tend to fail.\u201d Everyone, however, agrees on one thing: rents are ridiculous. It is frankly a miracle that Soho has stayed as distinctive as it has, given the amount a business would need to survive. And there\u2019s a general assumption that, whatever the details, this is what did for Madame Jojo\u2019s. How could you make a 21st-century profit from such a niche concern? \u201cNo, no, no,\u201d says Russell Norman, inventor of Polpo, Polpetto and Spontino, informal, Italian tapas joints, insisting Madame Jojo\u2019s closed down because of the bouncers\u2019 attack with baseball bats. \u201cIt was obviously a situation that needed a fair amount of scrutiny.\u201d He rejects, too, the idea that there are two Sohos, the quirky, seedy, sex-club one, and the Big Landord, crazy rent, corporatised one. \u201cIt\u2019s ironic that usually the bad guys are reckoned to be the landlords of Soho, people like Soho Estates. That was founded by Raymond, who established the sex clubs and gave it its gorgeous seediness.\u201d Even he admits that the rents are crazy: \u201cOur recent rent review on Beak street was breathtaking. But it\u2019s the way of the world. Landlords have to make money just like the rest of us, they have people to employ.\u201d I think Norman is the best thing to happen to London food since we discovered avocados, but this portrait of landlords as productive, job-generating people, just doing their best is \u2026 well, it\u2019s silly. I\u2019d only been in Madame Jojo\u2019s once myself, when my ex had a job as a stage manager. I thought it would be amusing to watch him scuttling around in a black polo neck picking up g-strings. It wasn\u2019t amusing at all. Since then, it had diversified \u2013 dabbled in entertainment with content besides nudity. It was, like its location, always too quirky to turn into a Spearmint Rhino. But the closure of one club, even that club, could never have sucked the oxygen out of this place. Soho\u2019s idiosyncrasy and transgression is more of an atmosphere than an act.",

The site creator, Brandon Stanton, recently traveled to Jordan and Turkey and interviewed Syrian families who were cleared for resettlement in America. Following the Nov. 13 attacks in Paris, many U.S. politicians have vowed to keep Syrian refugees out of their states. One of the refugees coming to the United States \u2014 an unidentified scientist headed to Troy, Mich. \u2014 described his love for his family in a series of \"Humans of New York\" posts. SYRIAN REFUGEES SCHEDULED TO ARRIVE IN TEXAS AMID STATE'S LEGAL BATTLE WITH U.S. GOVERNMENT The man and his wife married \"out of love,\" he said. The two had met in college and were a modern family, he said. \"We had good days and bad days and rich days and poor days but we were always together,\" he said. The couple had a son and a daughter, and the family settled into a four-building compound \u2014 along with many other families \u2014 that the man had designed. The compound was ripped apart by missiles, the needles and shrapnel piercing the family's world. His wife and daughter were on the top floor of their house at the time of the attack, he said. \"Nobody was around to help, so my son had to carry the pieces of his mother and sister out of the house. He was fourteen at the time,\" the man said. \"He was so smart. He was the top of his class. He's not the same. Right after it happened, he'd write 'mom' in his notebook over and over. He'd cry all night long. \"We survived but we're dead psychologically,\" he added. \"Everything ended for us that day. That was our destiny. That was our share in life.\" SYRIAN REFUGEE LIVING IN BROOKLYN TO DONALD TRUMP: 'SYRIANS LIVE A NORMAL LIFE. THEY ARE NOT TERRORISTS' Following the bombings, the man was diagnosed with cancer \u2014 \"from my sadness and my stress,\" he believes. \"My friend in America tells me that it's an easy surgery, but I'm fighting against time,\" he said. \"It's spreading, and I think that soon it will move beyond my stomach. And then there's nothing I can do.\" The unidentified man also discussed his dreams for America, and his hopes to \"make a difference in the world.\" Some of his inventions are currently in use, and he hopes to continue his research after moving to Troy. The man's final post drew nearly 10,000 comments, including one from Obama. \"As a husband and a father, I cannot even begin to imagine the loss you've endured. You and your family are an inspiration,\" Obama wrote. \"I know that the great people of Michigan will embrace you with the compassion and support you deserve. Yes, you can still make a difference in the world, and we're proud that you'll pursue your dreams here. Welcome to your new home. You're part of what makes America great.\" Obama's comment plays off of the campaign slogan of Donald Trump \u2014 \"Make America Great Again\" \u2014 and also marks the President's first public comments about migration following Trump's call to ban Muslims from entering the United States. Obama previously left a comment on a \"Humans of New York\" post in September about a young Iranian boy.",

(AP) FUERSTENBERG, Germany \u2013 Officials in Germany solemnly commemorated the liberation of two Nazi concentration camps 70 years ago in the closing days of World War II. Poland's first lady, Anna Komorowska, joined in remembrance activities Sunday at the site of the Ravensbrueck women's camp in northern Germany. Many of the prisoners came from Poland. Komorowska, wife of Polish President Bronislaw Komorowski, planted a memorial rose along with Daniela Schadt, partner of German President Joachim Gauck, and camp survivor Annette Chalut. Elderly survivors joined black-clad Polish nuns, some of whom held red and white Polish flags. A Mass was said in Polish. Ceremonies have been held across Germany and Poland throughout the spring marking the advance of Allied troops as Nazi Germany neared defeat. They are even more poignant this year because of the dwindling number of survivors and witnesses to the Holocaust, the murder of 6 million Jews by the racist and anti-Semitic regime of German dictator Adolf Hitler. Ceremonies also were taking place at the former Sachsenhausen camp near Berlin. The U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum says 30,000 to 50,000 people died at Sachsenhausen, where inmates included Jews, Poles, Soviet prisoners of war and opponents of the Nazis. At Ravensbrueck, more than 130,000 women passed through the camp and 20,000 to 30,000 died there. Inmates were subjected to forced labor in the armaments industry. Many died because of malnutrition and disease in filthy conditions; thousands of others were shot or sent to gas chambers if considered too weak or injured to work. Days before Allied troops arrived, Nazi officials forced thousands from the camps to start death marches away from the camps. Many of those prisoners died of exposure or disease or were killed by guards along the way. Sachsenhausen was liberated by Polish troops under Soviet command on April 22, 1945, Ravensbrueck by Soviet forces on April 30.",

        "article": "New York State's Commissioner of Taxation and Finance said yesterday that the Reagan Administration had sent him a letter filled with ''gobbledygook'' in response to his plea that the Treasury Department revive its enforcement efforts against cigarette smugglers. ''They cut the budget,'' said the Commissioner, James H. Tully Jr., ''and then try to justify it afterward.'' The author of the Treasury's defense, John M. Walker Jr., Assistant Secretary for Enforcement and Operations, responded last night to Mr. Tully's scorn by saying that the Federal budget simply had to be cut, and that state and local authorities could do a better job of dissuading tax cheats and capturing smugglers. Mr. Tully said he had written Treasury Secretary Donald Regan on Oct. 22 arguing that joint state and Federal investigations of cigarette smuggling since 1979 had saved New York State $28 million last year and could soon save $40 million annually. Federal officials announced in mid-October that they had decided to cut back on enforcing the law. Until then, the Federal effort had involved agents, helicopters, unmarked cars and teletyped messages that helped track and capture interstate cigarette smugglers between North Carolina, for example, a major manufacturing state, and New York. How much money the Treasury Department expected to save from the cutback could not be determined yesterday. The Treasury Department responded to Mr. Tully's plea in a letter signed by Mr. Walker and dated Nov. 20. The letter, which Mr. Tully received Friday, stated in part, according to a deputy to Mr. Tully: ''The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) and state assessment programs indicate that the present increases in state revenues are due to a reduction in the amount of cigarettes diverted from the legal distribution system without payment of tax. ATF's enforcement of the Contraband Cigarette Law highlighted this diversion problem and effectively pointed it out to the concerned state taxation and revenue officials. The increase in state cigarette tax collections and Federal budgetary constraints dictate that the Treasury Department reduce the resources allocated to cigarette enforcement.'' Mr. Tully said heatedly from Albany that he found this reply ''infuriating.'' ''What he's saying,'' the Tax Commissioner continued, ''is some kind of nonsense about how they didn't need to do anything any more because they had made the states aware of the problem.'' Mr. Tully insisted that states had known about the problem for years and that he and others had persuaded Congress in 1978 to pass the Federal law providing for up to five years in jail and a $100,000 fine for cigarette smuggling. Mr. Walker, when reached for comment in Pennsylvania, said: ''We simply have difficult and painful choices to make in terms of allocating resources.'' He added that the Treasury's enforcement effort had helped only states, not the Treasury. Mr. Tully's deputy, John E. Kelly, quoted a study released recently by the United States Commission on Intergovernmental Relations to the effect that Texas could lose $43 million a year in uncollected taxes due to smuggling, Florida $36 million, and other states tens of millions more. New York City officials said when the Federal cutback was announced that the city feared the loss of as much as $15 million in city cigarette tax revenues in addition to the state's potential $40 million. The New York State tax on a package of cigarettes, said Mr. Kelly, is 15 cents. The city tax is 8 cents. The Federal tax, collected directly at the point of manufacture, is also 8 cents. Mr. Walker of the Treasury pointed out that if New York's cigarette taxes were considerably lower, the margin of profit on smuggling cigarettes from North Carolina, where the taxes are very low, would be decreased. ''That's a hard political choice,'' he said, but it could be done.",

        "article": "It is staffed by curators who share uplifting content about social issues \u2013 \"stuff that matters\" \u2013 with a young online audience. And it notoriously uses the \"curiosity gap\" headline, a link that contains almost no information about the video or article you're about to click, but which pulls you in, regardless: \"Watch The First 54 Seconds. That's All I Ask. You'll Be Hooked After That, I Swear\" (a documentary about street kids making instruments out of garbage) or \"His First 4 Sentences Are Interesting. The 5th Blew My Mind. And Made Me a Little Sick\" (a polemical video about the US healthcare system). The habit was enough to provoke one writer to dismissively conclude that \"Upworthy is a site that posts viral videos with terrible headlines\". Yet the site is doing something right. Upworthy's 100 most popular posts were viewed and shared more than 380m times during 2013, while the two-year-old site's record monthly visitors figure was in excess of 87m \u2013 around the same as the Guardian, which, as a newspaper, is approaching its 200th birthday. Upworthy was launched in March 2012 by a group including Peter Koechley, a former managing editor of the satirical news site The Onion, and Eli Pariser, a co-founder of the social campaigning site Avaaz. It had an explicit social purpose. At first it contained little other than a mission statement and links to articles and content relating to the Trayvon Martin case \u2013 the shooting of a Florida teenager that sparked protest across the US. Upworthy's curators are encouraged to share material with a message that will resonate with their target audience of progressive young readers, dubbed \"millennials\" or \"Generation Y\" by marketers and sociologists. The curators, many of them 20-somethings, believe social purpose is integral to the site's success in connecting with the demographic. \"A lot of general sites cover everything, and a lot of my friends \u2013 I have a lot of gay friends, minority friends \u2013 have a craving for that kind of content, and it's just an easier way to find it to go to Upworthy,\" says Joseph Lamour, who joined Upworthy from an entertainment news site last April. Rossalyn Warren, 24, who joined the site the same month, says Upworthy supplements traditional media rather than replaces it. \"I totally think that people of our generation, they definitely go to the Guardian, New York Times for hard-hitting journalism,\" she says, \"but Upworthy [is] about visual, sharable content that appeals, because it's created to work on social platforms.\" The site has recently started making a big deal out of its fact-checking controls. A blog from its copy chief stresses that \"credibility is perhaps the most important trait of great curation\". This attitude is far from universal. Other viral content originators are known for spreading unverifiable information. Perhaps the most famous is FCKH8, a pro-gay rights online clothing vendor (with mixed reviews at best), which has a habit of finding heartwarming or shocking anonymous letters from parents to their closeted children, or from people to their bigoted family members. Efforts to find the writers of such letters generally fail. FCKH8's explanation \u2013 that they wish to stay anonymous \u2013 may be credible, but such content is, as a result, not always trusted. There's set to be another uptick in Upworthy's quality, too. At the South by Southwest technology festival in Austin, Texas, Upworthy named a number of future journalistic collaborators, including the US-based investigative not-for-profit site ProPublica, which worked with the Guardian on some of the Edward Snowden NSA revelations. ProPublica will collaborate with Upworthy on stories covering income inequality, they say. \"We're big fans of what they've been doing. They've accomplished a lot in a short time,\" ProPublica's president, Richard Tofel, told Niemen Journalism Lab. There's more science than you might suspect in creating Upworthy's much-maligned headlines. The trademark Upworthy headlines try to hook your interest without telling you much. For a time, they flew \u2013 but eventually disappointed users, who stopped going for them. The headlines also backfired when other outlets tried them. CNN's Twitter account faced a wide backlash when it covered a stabbing with the headline: \"14-year-old girl stabbed her little sister 40 times, police say. The reason why will shock you.\" Upworthy noticed the curiosity-gap backlash before its critics, largely because of its relentless focus on testing its headlines to destruction. Each Upworthy article is given no fewer than 25 separate headlines, which are automatically tested to see which attracts the most hits. So what would the headline on the Upworthy story so far be? The answer, Lamour suggests, isn't easy. \"I would need time to write 25 headlines on that and then only pick one ... It would be a joke of some kind, I know that!\"",

        "article": "LOS ANGELES \u2013 In Hollywood a big chest can mean big bucks, so wannabe starlets often go under the knife when seeking their big break. But these days, more and more celebrities are going in reverse, and heading heading back to the doctor\u2019s office to get those oversized implants removed. Heidi Montag of \u201cThe Hills\u201d fame captured headlines in 2010 when she suddenly underwent a serious of dramatic surgeries including massive breast implants. But this year, the 20-something star decided she was \u201ctired of being the surgery girl\u201d and ditched the fake boobs. Montag was informed by a specialist that her F-size implants were \u201cbottoming out,\u201d also known as displacement, which results in the loss of tissue support at the bottom half and can mean the implant moves downward on the chest. In doing so, Montag joined Sharon Osbourne, Victoria Beckham, Heather Morris, Jenna Jameson, Tara Reid, Kimberly Stewart and Courtney Love, who all recently had the removal procedure done. \u201cI have seen implant removal or downsizing gaining traction over the past few years. This is a growing trend for all groups of women, not just celebrities. Downsizing has been three times more popular than going larger among my patients who decide to change their implant size. You would think that the reason is they bring unwanted attention, but that has not been a popular answer,\u201d Dr. Gabriel Chiu of Beverly Hills Plastic Surgery, Inc. told FOX411. \u201cThe most common answer is that they are tired of having such large breasts. The next most common answer has been that the large breasts feel awkward and that it has been difficult to get used to them. The economy and pop culture are also major influencers in why women are going smaller.\u201d According to Chiu, during the recent recession/depression, flaunting oversized breasts was deemed crass ,which directly influenced breast implant sizing: bigger was tackier and out of tune with the times, while moderation or balance/proportion was key. \u201cFolks were downsizing their cars, houses, and breast implant size. Plastic surgery often follows trends in popular culture,\u201d he explained. \u201cIn the case of breast implants, smaller/perkier was more chic. Fashion has adapted to this trend and clothing today accommodates smaller, more proportionate breasts than larger sizes.\u201d Fashion designer and model manager Nadja Atwal says oversized implants don't even increase one\u2019s prospect for getting work in show business anymore. \u201cIn the late 90\u2019s to up to five years ago, there was still a big glamour model industry with lots of men\u2019s magazines. That market has died down and the models with the big implants have little to no market anymore. Pam Anderson was the big bust icon during the \u2018Baywatch\u2019 era and was often copied,\u201d she explained. \u201cBut that trend never crossed over into the film industry and many models who desired to launch a serious acting career while sporting a fake D-cup got the \u2018bimbo\u2019 label \u2013 not the jobs.\u201d And as the cup size of the Hollywood community continues to shrink, chances are it is going to be discussed a lot more openly than perhaps it once was. \u201cIt has become socially acceptable to let everyone know that you\u2019re having your implants removed whereas it wasn\u2019t as socially acceptable to announce it in the past. Some are doing it because they are physically uncomfortable with the larger size. In their mind when they had them implanted they were only focused on having large breasts. They weren't thinking about the consequences of carrying two such large and heavy things on their chest, back pain, discomfort of having something so heavy and large on a small body,\u201d said Cliffside Malibu psychotherapist Stacy Kaiser. \u201cOthers are removing them because they once got large breasts to improve their self esteem or self image and have since grown more confident and don't feel they need them anymore to feel good.\u201d Implants indeed represent more than meets the eye. Potential complications include severe pain, thinning and shrinking of the skin, infection, rupture or a collection of fluid around the implant known as seroma. Depending on what needs to be done, the removal process usually costs around $5000.",

That means theater owners need to rely on concessions to stay afloat. Tune into \u201cTrue Confessions\u201d on ABC News\u2019 \u201c20/20\u2033 on Friday, March 7, at 10 p.m. ET. \u201cI make money by selling concessions,\u201d Robert Bucksbaum, who owns The Reel Cinema in Wofford Heights, Calif., told ABC News\u2019 \u201c20/20.\u201d \u201cWe still do pipe the smell of popcorn into the auditorium. \u2026 I\u2019ve got an exhaust pipe that runs from the popcorn machine into the actual auditorium.\u201d Speaking of popcorn, Bucksbaum said, concessions also carry a high mark up. For example, he said, the amount of popcorn it takes to fill a large bag can cost 8 cents to make. Bags by themselves can cost theaters 22 cents to 35 cents per bag, and a tub can range in cost from 85 cents to $1. A theater may sell a large tub of popcorn for $8, Bucksbaum said. So if a tub-size container cost the theater, say, 92 cents, combined with the 8 cents for the kernels, that tub of popcorn could carry a 700 percent mark-up. A visit to the movies may not just hit you in the wallet. Germs might also be lurking where you sit. \u201cYou have to be aware that the armrest, the seat and other areas of the theater are contaminated with the public that sat before you,\u201d New York University Professor of Microbiology Philip M.

Then, \u201c20/20\u2033 asked Tierno to analyze the lab results. On one seat in New York City, a sample showed evidence of bacteria usually found in cattle and soil. Other samples turned up bacteria commonly found in human feces and even yeast. \u201cWe found the yeast in two armrests,\u201d Tierno said. \u201cThey were grossly contaminated with yeast.\u201d According to Bucksbaum, there are no laws stating how often theaters have to clean the seats. But, Tierno said, there are things you can do to avoid getting sick. \u201cOne of the things, when I\u2019m eating popcorn, is not to touch the seats with your right hand,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to hit the armrest, keep your hand in the air. \u2026 Always have a \u2018good hand\u2019 and a \u2018bad hand.\u2019\u201d",

The former offensive lineman spent 15 years in the NFL before retiring after winning a Super Bowl with the Ravens last season. He played in six Pro Bowls and was a two-time All-Pro. We all know one of the job requisites to be a lineman in the NFL is to be, well, fat. Birk was, to be nice, chunky during his career, as you can see in the photo above. But since retiring he has realized being fat probably isn\u2019t that great for your health. He\u2019s made some changes to his diet, is working out more, and now looks a lot different: He\u2019s lost a total of 75 pounds and 10 inches from his waist. Now he has a new career in mind as he wants to become a model. The Baltimore Ravens website has the details: Birk is in the running to be the next Vi Model, which would feature him on the cover of The Challenge Magazine 2014 and turn him into the poster boy for Body By Visalus, a company that has the ultimate mission of ending obesity. Birk needs votes to reach the finals of the competition, and fans have less than four days to cast their ballots here. \u201cI don\u2019t really think of myself as a model. Maybe a glove model,\u201d Birk joked. Here\u2019s more on why Birk has made such a lifestyle change: Birk discovered Visalus and liked the company\u2019s community approach to weight loss. For example, if somebody in the program loses 10 pounds, they\u2019ll donate 30 nutrition shakes to obese or at need kids. \u201cI really like to help people,\u201d said Birk, who was named the 2012 Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year. \u201cI really do think that we have a serious problem in this country and our culture when it comes to our diet. We have a totally wrong approach about how to lose weight.\u201d Birk started the program in March and is down to 235 pounds. Now he wants to become the Vi Model so he can better spread his message about the importance of better nutrition and ways of losing weight to others. \u201cAll I knew was being big. Now I\u2019m not so big and I\u2019m loving it,\u201d said Birk, who is not a paid endorser. \u201cI think I\u2019ve really developed a lifestyle that I can sustain now. I feel great physically, and I\u2019ve got tons of energy. It really has changed my life that I used to know.\u201d",

The next challenge promises to be even tougher for the No. 1-ranked Wildcats -- a matchup against No. 23-ranked Notre Dame Saturday at noon ET in the inaugural Never Forget Tribute Classic at the Prudential Center in Newark, N.J. Villanova (9-0) is off to a fast start in its quest to become the first program to repeat as national champions since Florida in 2006-07. \"La Salle came in with a good game plan against us and played with a little more energy than us,\" Villanova head coach Jay Wright said after the win over the Explorers on Tuesday night. \"They played really well against us. We didn't have our best game because of them and we found a way to grind it out. Any game you get in like this is valuable, win or lose. It's more fun to win and learn from it.\" Sophomore guard Jalen Brunson scored a career-high 26 points against La Salle. Brunson knocked down 10 of 17 shots, including a pair of clutch jumpers down the stretch. \"He's one of those guys that you know at any point that you need a bucket, he can go get one for you,\" Wright said of Brunson. National Player of the Year candidate Josh Hart scored 21 points as the Wildcats won their first game as the top-ranked team in the country. Villanova spent three weeks atop the Top 25 last February on its way to the school's second national championship. Notre Dame also enters this game at 9-0, the best start of head coach Mike Brey's era dating to the 2000-01 season. The Fighting Irish opened the 1973-74 season at 12-0. Since Brey took over, Notre Dame has faced the defending national champion 11 times, coming away with a victory seven times. Last season, Notre Dame defeated 2015 national champion Duke 95-91 at Cameron Indoor Stadium on Jan. 16, 2016. Notre Dame then defeated the Blue Devils 84-79 in overtime at the ACC quarterfinals on March 10. This season, the Fighting Irish have been led by junior forward Bonzie Colson, who earned his first ACC Player of the Week Award on Dec. 5. Colson currently owns a personal six-game streak of double-doubles. Against Iowa in the he ACC/Big Ten Challenge, Colson scored a game-high 24 points, swept a career-high 17 rebounds and shot 12 for 12 from the free throw line. Colson had 17 points and 14 rebounds in Notre Dame's most recent victory, 87-72 over Fort Wayne. \"It's staying composed and coming to play early,\" Colson told the South Bend Tribune. \"As a team, we try to get off to good starts. I feel like we're doing that really well. Excited what we did tonight.\" Senior guard Steve Vasturia paced Notre Dame with 21 points against Fort Wayne. Villanova will be a much more daunting opponent than Fort Wayne. \"It's just the thing you look forward to, these types of games,\" sophomore guard Rex Pflueger told the South Bend Tribune. \"It's going to be strictly business when we get there.\" Villanova leads the all-time series with Notre Dame, 18-17.",

        "article": "BRUSSELS \u2014 European Union authorities have accused the Netherlands of making a special deal with Starbucks that helped the company lower its taxes, creating unfair advantages over other countries in the bloc. The report by the bloc\u2019s competition authority, made public on Friday, is a preliminary finding in a review of Starbucks\u2019 arrangements with the Netherlands. It is the latest sign of mounting concern, and indignation, over the scale of tax breaks for multinational companies in a period of weak growth and high unemployment in many parts of Europe. Regulators have also begun investigations into the tax affairs of companies like Amazon in Luxembourg and Apple in Ireland. And with the number of cases growing, the consequences for governments and businesses in Europe could be profound, and lasting. While companies face the prospect of repaying staggering sums of money, potentially giving governments a windfall, those governments are also wary of diminishing the their appeal to investors. \u201cBigger countries like France and Germany don\u2019t want these practices on their doorstep, but you can bet that smaller countries like the Netherlands and Luxembourg are going to fight tooth and nail to preserve the status quo,\u201d said Emanuela Lecchi, a partner in London with the law firm Watson, Farley & Williams. Starbucks said on Friday that it would continue to cooperate with the European Commission in the investigation, and that it had complied with all relevant tax rules, laws and international guidelines. It said \u201cthe method for calculating how much in taxes we pay has been reviewed by tax experts and approved by the Dutch tax authorities.\u201d The company also said that it had paid an effective global tax rate of 34 percent and \u201chas never sought unfair tax incentives.\u201d It is unclear how much Starbucks might have to pay in back taxes if a ruling went against it and the Netherlands. A final decision could take years. Starbucks\u2019 global sales last year were $16.45 billion, but only 8 percent of that amount was generated in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The case concerning Starbucks focuses on operations in Amsterdam that use the company\u2019s intellectual property rights for processes like roasting coffee beans, according to a 40-page report to the Dutch government formally published early Friday that described the scope of the investigation. Regulators suspect that the Dutch authorities attributed too little profit to these Starbucks operations. In particular, they are examining whether Dutch authorities allowed Starbucks to use unfair methods to shrink its taxable income, including paying a royalty to a partnership in Britain, Alki, for a recipe for coffee-roasting. Alki is not taxed in the Netherlands but is \u201cpossibly taxed at the country of the tax residence of the partners,\u201d said the report, adding that Alki made payments to an American Starbucks company. The commission also had doubts that the royalty was in line with international guidelines because it fluctuated from year to year, and \u201cis not related to the output, sales, or to profit.\u201d The commission asked the Netherlands to provide more information on Alki. It also asked how Starbucks in the Netherlands determined the price of the green, unroasted beans supplied by its Swiss subsidiary. A decision in the case against the Netherlands, which covers the last seven years, could force the government to recoup large amounts of back taxes from Starbucks. Investigators have the scope to expand the case back 10 years if they find sufficient evidence. The report was dated June 11 and addressed to Frans Timmermans, the former Dutch foreign minister who recently became first vice president for the European Commission. The case is a response by the European Commission to calls to stop companies from seeking to set up in countries offering specialized tax arrangements and then finding ways to account for their profits there, even when much of the money is made elsewhere. In a letter to the Dutch House of Representatives, Eric D. Wiebes, the state secretary for finance, wrote that the arrangement with Starbucks was \u201cfully in line with international transfer pricing standards\u201d and \u201cconsistent with the policy framework applied by the government in its efforts to create an attractive business climate.\u201d Starbucks said in April that it was moving its European headquarters from the Netherlands, where it has about 50 stores, to Britain, where it has nearly 800 stores and is expanding. That move followed intense criticism of Starbucks two years ago for paying small amounts of tax and even no tax in some years. In September, the European Commission published a similar preliminary report of Ireland\u2019s past tax arrangements with Apple, chastising Irish officials for giving the company unlawful so-called state aid that masqueraded as tax breaks. The commission said Ireland might need to collect back taxes from Apple that analysts said could reach into the billions of dollars. Another European Union country, Luxembourg, has been the subject of intense scrutiny since Nov. 5, when the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists published a report accusing more than 300 companies, including the Pepsi Bottling Group, Ikea and FedEx, of benefiting from preferential tax deals with the government of Luxembourg. The European Commission is already investigating the tax incentives Luxembourg offered to Amazon and to a unit of Fiat. Those cases, and the inquiries concerning Starbucks and Apple, were brought by Joaqu\u00edn Almunia, the former antitrust chief of the European Commission, this year. Those investigations have been taken over by Margrethe Vestager, who succeeded Mr. Almunia. Ms. Vestager is working under Jean-Claude Juncker, whose posts in Luxembourg from 1989 to 2013 included finance minister, treasury minister and prime minister, and who now leads the commission. That has created concerns that Mr. Juncker has conflicts of interest in the tax investigations. Mr. Juncker said on Wednesday that he would not interfere in the investigations and would make himself answerable to Ms. Vestager if necessary. Mr. Juncker also pledged that his deputy, Mr. Timmermans, would not interfere in Ms. Vestager\u2019s investigation of Starbucks. \u201cThe commission in the past has always clearly been independent in these assessments,\u201d Mr. Timmermans said in a news conference with Mr. Juncker on Wednesday that was focused on the recent revelations in Luxembourg. Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the surname of the head of the European Commission. He is Jean-Claude Juncker, not Juner.",

        "article": "There are 70 million deaf people around the world. And many of them lack basic assistance, in places like hospitals and schools, and even in religious communities. Nashiru Abdulai,\u00c2 who was born in Ghana and lives in the United States, became deaf as a child because of an illness. As a Muslim, he says his needs were often not understood, especially in the Muslim world. So he became an activist. And now Abdulai\u00c2 is the president of the Global Deaf Muslim organisation (GDM). Deaf Muslims have not yet had the chance to learn about Islam; we have a lot of catching up to do. Nashiru Abdulai, the president of the Global Deaf Muslim\u00c2 For deaf Muslims, accessing Islamic information still remains a challenge, Abdulai says. So the GDM was established in 2005 aiming to address the rights and needs of this community. \"[At a mosque] everything will happen in spoken language. Obviously a deaf Muslim won't know what is happening around them. They may ask themselves 'who do I turn to?', 'who supports my cause?'. This is where an organisation for deaf Muslims is necessary,\" he says. \"When a group finally does have an organisation representing their specific needs, it becomes an inspiration for that community.\" Abdulai says many deaf people grow up with ideas about Islam based on information passed from one family member to another, and these explanations are often riddle with cultural bias or misinformation. He says that although many people believe reading the Quran in their native language is sufficient for deaf Muslims to understand the religion,\u00c2 the\u00c2 concepts are sometimes not clear enough for a full understanding.\u00c2 Abdulai\u00c2 feels that because deaf people have a visual language, and acquire meaning by seeing, it makes more sense to show them pictures that explain things in a visual language. The GDM's goal is to be able to screen out cultural misinformation, and to make sure the correct meanings of concepts are understood,\u00c2 he says.\u00c2 The lack of accessible materials and support were identified by the GDM as a growing problem that the organisation needs to address. \"Deaf Muslims have not yet had the chance to learn about Islam; we have a lot of catching up to do,\" Abdulai says. So are Muslim societies actively excluding their deaf members, or is this simply about a lack of awareness surrounding the needs of this community? Why is this happening? And what solutions can be implemented? In this episode of\u00c2 Talk to Al Jazeera\u00c2 , Sami Zeidan speaks to Nashiru Abdulai, the president of the Global Deaf Muslim organisation, about religion, inclusiveness, and the challenges facing deaf Muslims today.\u00c2",

        "article": "A prominent national white supremacist leader has resigned as a Donald Trump delegate to the Republican National Convention after campaign officials said his nomination was the result of a \u201cdatabase error.\u201d William Daniel Johnson, who has called for a whites-only United States and the deportation of other races and ethnicities, said in an interview Wednesday that he resigned for the good of the Trump campaign, which he supports. \u201cThey don\u2019t need the baggage that came along with my signing up as a delegate,\u201d said Johnson, a Los Angeles corporate lawyer who has been active in U.S. white supremacy circles for more than three decades. Johnson\u2019s name was included in a slate of delegates that the Trump campaign submitted Monday for certification by the California secretary of state\u2019s office. After Mother Jones magazine reported Johnson\u2019s inclusion on the list, Trump officials moved quickly to remove him. Campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks told The Washington Post that \u201ca database error led to the inclusion of a potential delegate that had been rejected and removed from the campaign\u2019s list in February 2016.\u201d Johnson, who has said that U.S. citizenship should be limited to white people with \u201cno ascertainable trace of Negro blood,\u201d said he believed the Trump campaign staff members who added his name to the list were unaware of his white supremacist beliefs. \u201cI was a delegate for two hours, they got inundated, and that\u2019s probably the time they said, \u2018Who is this Johnson?\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cNobody knows who I am. I think the Trump campaign probably knows more about me now, but you can\u2019t hold that against the vetting people in a campaign. I didn\u2019t emblazon on there that I\u2019m a white nationalist. So it was an innocent mistake on the vetting person\u2019s part.\u201d California Republican Party bylaws permit campaigns to amend their delegate lists until June 27, when those lists are submitted to the Republican National Committee, party spokeswoman Kaitlyn MacGregor said. Heidi Beirich of the Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors extremism, said it is hard to believe the Trump campaign was not aware of Johnson\u2019s beliefs. She noted Johnson\u2019s long history of high-profile white supremacist activism, and the fact that he founded the pro-Trump American National super PAC and that he has actively campaigned for Trump. Earlier this year, Johnson recorded robo-calls supporting Trump that were used ahead of the Republican primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire, Vermont and Minnesota. In those calls, which received extensive national media attention, Johnson said, \u201cThe white race is dying out in America and Europe because we are afraid to be called \u2018racist,\u2019 \u201d warned of the \u201cgradual genocide against the white race\u201d and complained that in the United States, \u201cfew schools anymore have beautiful white children as a majority.\u201d \u201cDonald Trump is not a racist, but Donald Trump is not afraid,\u201d he said. Then, referring to Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), both of whom are children of Cuban immigrants, he said: \u201cDon\u2019t vote for a Cuban. Vote for Donald Trump.\u201d Johnson, who has a law degree from Columbia University, said that the Trump campaign had not authorized the calls. He gave out his cellphone number and asked people to call him if they wanted. Beirich called the Trump campaign\u2019s inclusion of Johnson as a delegate \u201cdespicable.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no way to not have known this; those robo-calls have been all over the press for months,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to wonder about the campaign\u2019s competence, or if this is once again pandering in some way to white supremacists.\u201d Throughout his campaign, Trump has battled the perception that he has been at least tacitly sympathetic to white supremacists. He appeared slow to repudiate former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke after Duke praised him, and he has retweeted messages from white nationalists. Beirich said that Trump had been careful not to offend white supremacists during the Republican primary campaign. She said she expected him to moderate his tone in the general-election campaign, but she said she found it hard to believe that any candidate would want the support of people with Johnson\u2019s views. \u201cIt\u2019s 2016. Nobody appeals to white supremacists,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is the worst of American history. This is fire hoses and dogs being sicced on black people who want the right to vote \u2014 this is what this represents. This is unacceptable.\u201d Johnson said he has been a leading voice of white supremacy since at least 1985, when he wrote a book proposing a constitutional amendment that would have limited U.S. citizenship to \u201cnon-Hispanic whites of the European race, in whom there is no ascertainable trace of Negro blood, nor more than one-eighth\u201d any other nonwhite race or ethnicity. He proposed that some \u201cHispanic whites\u201d would be eligible for U.S. citizenship provided \u201cthey are in appearance indistinguishable from Americans whose ancestral home is in the British Isles or Northwestern Europe.\u201d Johnson has run for Congress in Wyoming and Arizona and a judgeship in California, and he has raised money for the presidential campaign of former congressman Ron Paul (R-Tex.). His campaigns have been based on \u201cwhite nationalist\u201d platforms, and he has even complained about fictional character Harry Potter kissing a \u201cChinese girl\u201d in a movie, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. However, Johnson has said on his law firm\u2019s website that he has long represented Japanese corporations doing business in the United States, and that he can \u201cspeak, read and write Japanese.\u201d The website is written mainly in Japanese, and Johnson speaks in Japanese in a video on the site. Johnson notes that he is looking for new Chinese clients. Johnson said he supports Trump because \u201che speaks his mind.\u201d \u201cHe won\u2019t govern by public opinion poll; he will speak what he thinks is right,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI believe Ron Paul was that way, I believe [Democratic candidate] Bernie Sanders is that way. And regardless of your political beliefs, that is a refreshing change.\u201d Johnson, who said his American Freedom Party has experienced an increase in recruitment because of Trump, said he likes Trump\u2019s positions on \u201csecuring our borders and keeping the jobs back in America.\u201d But he said he doesn\u2019t think that Trump supports white supremacist causes. \u201cI believe he does not,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt\u2019s unrequited love.\u201d Johnson, whose proposed 1985 constitutional amendment would have denied U.S. citizenship to anyone who was more than one-eighth \u201cSemitic,\u201d said he is not bothered that Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka converted to Judaism when she married an orthodox Jewish man. \u201cI do think it\u2019s better for a Christian to marry a Christian,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that\u2019s not my say, and it\u2019s not Donald Trump\u2019s say. That\u2019s his daughter\u2019s say.\u201d",

        "article": "The baby sharks that swam right up to the beach at Constance Moofushi were only a pre-show taster. What I was really there to see were the big boys, dozens of adult sharks in their natural habitat down on the sea bed. As divers will know, it is not always easy to get down to certain patches of reef. Strong currents that stream through candy-coloured corals can blast you off course, leaving you pedalling alongside alarmed-looking fish, both of you hopelessly trying to get back to where you wanted to be. Dive scooters can aid your progress and instructors at Constance Moofushi, on the South Ari Atoll, give lessons on using one. Non-divers might recognise them from James Bond\u2019s Thunderball, where a gang of bad guys gives chase on larger scooters that happen to have harpoons attached. Less cumbersome are the modern-day versions, which are light and torpedo-shaped, with a covered propeller at the back. I had a 20-minute practice session with one on the hotel beach, in shallow water marbled with confidence-boosting rays of sun. Triggers in the handles set the rotor spinning at a constant, gentle speed. To be streamlined I needed to kick my legs back to allow the flow of water to wash beneath my body while controlling the scooter\u2019s direction with my wrist. Once I had a feel for it, it was easy. Moving forward smoothly, with my arms out in front, the scooter transformed my usual underwater profile \u2013 such poise, such grace! It was time to go deeper. Shark Point is a dive site where sharks \u2013 6ft-long bruisers, some of them \u2013 congregate above a drop-off point, a kind of coral cliff edge. Using the scooters to pull us through a channel of strong current, there was not much to see apart from ever-deepening blues until an otherwordly formation of eagle rays suddenly glided by. As the shadows cleared, beneath them were 10 to 15 reef sharks. Heads and tails twitching, they patrolled up and down the reef edge, on the other side of which lurked the gloom of a 60ft abyss. The scooter transformed my usual underwater profile \u2013 such poise, such grace! Cutting the propeller for a minute to watch, I counted about 20 sharks, jerking in and out of silver shoals of fish, their outlines smudging occasionally in the ribbons of current. The beauty of the site is that it feels like dropping in on a crossroads busy with all manner of marine life going about their business. Eventually, we moved off, tracing the reef edge and watching over the hunt. As the traffic beneath thinned out, my guide, Christian, pointed out a three-metre-wide eagle ray spread casually across the sea bed, eyes flicking up at us through the sand, but otherwise motionless. \u201cNothing to see here\u201d, he might well have said, as we set a new course for the boat, gripping the handles harder so the scooters could power us back up to the sunlight.

        "article": "By NAILA-JEAN MEYERSMAY 31, 2014 PARIS \u2014 Asked Thursday if being the top American woman at the French Open affected her, Sloane Stephens said, \u201cIt means nothing.\u201d What means something, it seems, is that this is a Grand Slam event. Stephens, seeded 15th, defeated No. 22 Ekaterina Makarova, 6-3, 6-4, on Saturday to advance to the second week of a major tournament for the sixth consecutive time, the longest active streak on the WTA Tour. Since the beginning of 2013, Stephens is 21-5 in Grand Slam singles matches and 32-29 at all other tournaments. This year, she has advanced past the third round in only three of the 11 tournaments she has played: the French Open, the Australian Open and the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, Calif. At her postmatch news conference, Stephens was repeatedly asked to explain the disparity and gave several variations of \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d \u201cIf I knew, I would capitalize on it,\u201d she said. \u201cI would do it every week. I would, you know, make the most of it. But I guess it\u2019s all just a learning experience. Rather this than anything else, so it\u2019s O.K. for now.\u201d Stephens will next face No. 4 Simona Halep of Romania, the highest remaining seed in the women\u2019s draw. Halep defeated Mar\u00eda-Teresa Torr\u00f3-Flor, 6-3, 6-0, and has lost only 11 games over three matches. She had won only one match here in four previous appearances in the main draw. \u201cIt\u2019s not a surprise, because I\u2019m more confident now in myself,\u201d Halep said, adding: \u201cI\u2019m enjoying the moment now. It\u2019s my best of my career, and I have to be happy on court and to fight for my chance.\u201d Stephens, 21, and Halep, 22, were born about 18 months apart and played in junior events together. But their career trajectories have been wildly different of late. Halep has soared up the rankings in the past year, winning seven titles. Stephens is the highest-ranked player yet to reach a singles final on tour. But Stephens has had greater success at Grand Slam events. She reached the semifinals at the Australian Open and the quarterfinals at Wimbledon last year; Halep did not advance past the third round of a major until last year\u2019s United States Open. \u201cFor her, I think she\u2019s played really, really well, like, in the smaller tournaments like I haven\u2019t done, and she has a lot of experience with that,\u201d Stephens said. \u201cI have a lot of experience here. I think we\u2019re just going to go out there and compete and just see what happens. I know she\u2019s going to give her best, and so am I.\u201d Also Saturday, No. 1 Rafael Nadal defeated Leonardo Mayer, 6-2, 7-5, 6-2, although he acknowledged afterward that back pain was affecting his serve. No. 5 David Ferrer, Nadal\u2019s opponent in last year\u2019s final, moved on to the fourth round with a 6-2, 7-6 (2), 6-3 victory over No. 32 Andreas Seppi. A brief surge by American men slowed as Jack Sock and Donald Young could not join John Isner in the fourth round. Sock lost to Dusan Lajovic, 6-4, 7-5, 6-3, and Young rallied against Guillermo Garc\u00eda-L\u00f3pez but fell in five sets, 6-2, 6-4, 2-6, 6-7 (4), 6-4. \u201cLast year or a couple years ago, I would have thrown it in,\u201d Young said. \u201cIt would have been three sets to love, whatever the score was, and 6-1, 6-2. I decided to fight, and I felt I was better than that. I felt I had a chance to win even from two sets to love down.\u201d The crowd at Court 1, known as the bullring, appreciated the effort, repeatedly chanting his name and giving him a roaring ovation as he walked off the court. Young\u2019s match was the second wild five-setter of the day after No. 23 Ga\u00ebl Monfils delighted his home crowd by outlasting No. 14 Fabio Fognini, 5-7, 6-2, 6-4, 0-6, 6-2. A third five-setter will have to wait until Sunday to finish. No. 7 Andy Murray\u2019s match against No. 28 Philipp Kohlschreiber was suspended by darkness tied at 7-7 in the final set. Ahead by two sets to one, Murray was up a break twice in the fourth, but Kohlschreiber fought back to force a fifth. Each player gained a break edge in the fifth set, but neither could put the match away before darkness fell. The women\u2019s draw lost another top-five seed when No. 5 Petra Kvitova fell to No. 27 Svetlana Kuznetsova, 6-7, 6-1, 9-7, after serving for the match twice. No. 23 Lucie Safarova knocked out No. 11 Ana Ivanovic, who had been having a strong spring on clay, 6-3, 6-3. With the women\u2019s field whittled to 16, only seven of the top 15 seeds remain. But among those who did reach the fourth round were No. 145 Pauline Parmentier, a wild-card entry from France, and No. 148 Kiki Bertens, a qualifier from the Netherlands. Halep, a quarterfinalist at the Australian Open, said that she was trying to keep out the pressure of being the highest remaining seed and that her recent success had her more prepared for tough matches. \u201cI found my good way to play, and I found a way to be relaxed on court and just to take the pleasure without pressure,\u201d she said.

        "article": "If there\u2019s a War on Christmas, Christmas is winning. I\u2019ve touched on this before. Insofar as there is a war, it\u2019s not on Christmas. It\u2019s by Christmas on everything else. Poor Thanksgiving has been run over roughshod. Now even Wal-Mart employees are being fed dinner and obliged to stay at work for that day, otherwise known as Black Friday Eve. That\u2019s why I am a vigilante. I am a rogue. I am a bandit. I am a Thanksgiving Warrior. I thought perhaps they\u2019d wait a day or two for us to lick our Halloween wounds and recover. I was wrong. The day after Halloween I saw a \u201cTech the Halls\u201d sign hanging in a Radio Shack window. In CVS, the Halloween chocolates were already being replaced by the Christmas chocolates. Over the radio, Burl Ives\u2019s dolorous warble had begun wending its way to our ears. They weren\u2019t playing around. They were marshaling the troops. And I was sick and tired of it. Sick and tired of the colors and the carols and the trappings. Sick and tired of the Vivid New Takes on holiday music and holiday eats. Not sick of the Starbucks seasonal beverages yet, because I am only human, but surely getting there. How was it this time of year already? Wasn\u2019t it just days ago that I was writing last year\u2019s column about the Ineluctable Christmas Creep? I was sick and tired of the vision of myself, decades from now, with my dependents gathered at my knee, asking me on a chill night around the customary pre-pre-Christmas-shopping turkey what I did in the Christmas Wars. \u201cWhy, nothing,\u201d I will say. \u201cI stood there and watched as they came for Thanksgiving, and did nothing. Then they came for Halloween, and I did nothing then either, still resenting Halloween for the year when it fell on a Thursday and swallowed the whole week in a hideous maw of constant costumes. Columbus Day was abandoned already when the Christmas shock troops got there, and by the time they reached Labor Day they were rolling holidays up like it was nothing. Fourth of July put up a valiant effort, but they got it, too. Red, White and Blue bowed to the Red, White and Green. Then they rolled up Easter (bafflingly enough), April Fools and the Ides of March, swallowed Valentine\u2019s Day without a second thought, rechristened New Years the 6th Day of Christmas, folded their arms, and settled in for a long winter\u2019s nap. \u2018The economy depends on this!\u2019 they insisted. \u2018Christmas must be country-wide! Christmas must be year-long!\u2019 \u201d \u201cShh!\u201d my children would say. \u201cIt\u2019s time for the hourly broadcast of Pop Artists Covering Carols, followed by the 89th screening of \u2018The Sound of Music,\u2019 both the original and the NBC Carrie Underwood version.\u201d No, this vision ate at me. It ate at me like every vision eats at Scrooge. I could not sit by and let this happen. I had to go to war. I armed myself with Post-it notes, on which I had written \u201cIT\u2019S NOT THANKSGIVING YET!\u201d as legibly as I could, and set out. Briefly I fantasized about adding a turkey costume. I would dub myself Gobbler Justice. My catchphrase would be: \u201cTurkeys can\u2019t fly, but we sure can flyer!\u201d \u201cLook,\u201d everyone would say. \u201cThere goes Gobbler Justice!\u201d Or, more probably, \u201cThat obese headless C-3PO looks drunk.\u201d But then I realized that the turkey costume would not arrive before Thanksgiving, thus defeating my stated goal. I had to go to war without it. War is, so far, Hell, as I\u2019m sure Gen. Sherman wrote on his postcards home. Once I was armed, I noticed foes everywhere. There was a store promoting Holiday bath scents. The next was displaying a Christmas tree in its window. In mid-November! Everywhere you turn, Christmas goods and items are multiplying exactly the way my Twitter followers aren\u2019t. Bookstores have the holiday shelves primed and ready. Get your stocking stuffers! No. Not yet. First the stuffing of the turkey, then the stuffing of the stocking. Is this so hard? Why are we focusing on the secularization of Christmas? I would feel more sympathetic if Christmas would get off my lawn during the first week of November. This has gotten so dire that Hanukkah and Thanksgiving are attempting a merger this year, to see if an alliance will allow them to withstand the Christmas onslaught. Or possibly it is just a vicissitude of the calendar. Either way: Good luck, friends! But I think the horse is already out of the barn, or the reindeer is out of the reindeer-housing area, or whatever metaphor we have decided to use. Holiday music blasted into my usual coffee shop, sleigh bells a-jingling. Sleigh bells are the mayonnaise of holiday music \u2014 they find their way into everything, whether you asked for them or not, and they make most things worse. On my TV set, people were already showing you exactly what Intricate Diamond She Deserves This Year. \u201cBah!\u201d I shouted. \u201cHumbug! It\u2019s Not Thanksgiving Yet!\u201d Now I know how the Grinch felt. The only difference is that I am right. My heart is exactly the correct size. I\u2019m not trying to stop Christmas from coming. I just want it to stop coming so prematurely. I love Christmas, within its national borders. But outside them \u2014 I flyer on sight. Once you start your vigilante career, it is difficult to stop. Red and green are everywhere you turn. You sticker around with wild abandon only to discover that you have falsely maligned several logos that are that color all year round and a couple of innocent fir trees that cannot help the way they look. Also, in your efforts to be subtle and not have the management at Starbucks escort you from the building after you pelted the entire building with the notes that were its due, you had to pretend you were there for the promotion and somehow wound up buying a stranger an eggnog latte. All in all, the war is going just about as badly as might be expected. And it\u2019s not even Thanksgiving yet! We still have weeks to go.",

        "article": "In recent years, the US supreme court has solidified the concept of corporate personhood. Following rulings in such cases as Hobby Lobby and Citizens United, US law has established that companies are, like people, entitled to certain rights and protections. But that\u2019s not the only instance of extending legal rights to nonhuman entities. New Zealand took a radically different approach in 2014 with the Te Urewera Act which granted an 821-square-mile forest the legal status of a person. The forest is sacred to the T\u016bhoe people, an indigenous group of the Maori. For them Te Urewera is an ancient and ancestral homeland that breathes life into their culture. The forest is also a living ancestor. The Te Urewera Act concludes that \u201cTe Urewera has an identity in and of itself\u201d and thus must be its own entity with \u201call the rights, powers, duties, and liabilities of a legal person\u201d. Te Urewera holds title to itself. Although this legal approach is unique to New Zealand, the underlying reason for it is not. Over the last 15 years I have documented similar cultural expressions by Native Americans about their traditional, sacred places. As an anthropologist, this research has often pushed me to search for an answer to the profound question: What does it mean for nature to be a person? A majestic mountain sits not far north-west of Albuquerque, New Mexico. Like a low triangle, with long gentle slopes, Mount Taylor is clothed in rich forests that appear a velvety charcoal-blue from the distance. Its bald summit, more than 11,000 feet high, is often blanketed in snow \u2013 a reminder of the blessing of water, when seen from the blazing desert below. The Zuni tribe lives about 40 miles west of Mount Taylor. In 2012, I worked with a team to interview 24 tribal members about the values they hold for Dewankwin K\u2019yaba:chu Yalanne (\u201cIn the East Snow-capped Mountain\u201d), as Mount Taylor is called in the Zuni language. We were told that their most ancient ancestors began an epic migration in the Grand Canyon. Over millennia they migrated across the south-west, with important medicine societies and clans living around Mount Taylor. After settling in their current pueblo homes, Zunis returned to this sacred mountain to hunt animals like deer and bear, harvest wild plants like acorns and cattails, and gather minerals used in sacrosanct rituals that keep the universe in order. Across the generations Dewankwin Kyaba:chu Yalanne has come to shape Zuni history, life and identity no less than the Vatican has for Catholics. But unlike holy places in the western world, Zunis believe Mount Taylor is a living being. Zuni elders told me that the mountain was created within the Earth\u2019s womb. As a mountain formed by volcanic activity, it has always grown and aged. The mountain can give life as people do. The mountain\u2019s snow melts in spring and nourishes plants and wildlife for miles. Water is the mountain\u2019s blood; buried minerals are the mountain\u2019s meat. Because it lives, deep below is its beating heart. Zunis consider Mount Taylor to be their kin. There is a stereotype that Native American peoples have a singular connection to nature. And yet in my experience, they do see the world in a fundamentally different way from most people I know. Whether it is mountains, rivers, rocks, animals, plants, stars or weather, they see the natural world as living and breathing, deeply relational, even at times all-knowing and transcendent. In my work with Arizona\u2019s Hopi tribe, I have traveled with cultural leaders to study sacred places. They often stop to listen to the wind, or search the sky for an eagle, or smile when it begins to rain, which they believe is a blessing the ancestors bestow upon them. During one project with the Hopi tribe, we came across a rattlesnake coiled near an ancient fallen pueblo. \u201cLong ago, one of them ancestors lived here and turned into a rattlesnake,\u201d the elder Raleigh H Puhuyaoma Sr shared with me, pointing to the nearby archaeological site. \u201cIt\u2019s now protecting the place.\u201d The elders left an offering of cornmeal to the snake. An elder later told me that it soon rained on his cornfield, a result from this spiritual exchange. Understanding these cultural worldviews matters greatly in discussions over protecting places in nature. The American west has a long history of battles over the control of land. We\u2019ve seen this recently from the Bundy family\u2019s takeover of the federal wildlife refuge in Oregon to the current fight over turning Bears Ears \u2013 1.9 million acres of wilderness \u2013 into a national monument in Utah. Yet often these battles are less about the struggle between private and public interests, and more about basic questions of nature\u2019s purpose. Do wild places have intrinsic worth? Or is the land a mere tool for human uses? Much of my research has involved documenting sacred places because they are being threatened by development projects on public land. The Zuni\u2019s sacred Mount Taylor, much of it managed by the US National Forest Service, has been extensively mined for uranium, and is the cause of violent disputes over whether it should be developed or protected. Even though the US does not legally recognize natural places as people, some legal protections exist for sacred places. Under the National Historic Preservation Act, for example, the US government must take into consideration the potential impacts of certain development projects on \u201ctraditional cultural properties\u201d. This and other federal heritage laws, however, provide tribes with a small voice in the process, little power, and rarely lead to preservation. More to the point, these laws reduce what tribes see as living places to \u201cproperties\u201d, obscuring their inherent spiritual value. In New Zealand, the Te Urewera Act offers a higher level of protection, empowering a board to be the land\u2019s guardian. The Te Urewera Act, though, does not remove its connection to humans. With a permit, people can hunt, fish, farm and more. The public still has access to the forest. One section of the law even allows Te Urewera to be mined. Te Urewera teaches us that acknowledging cultural views of places as living does not mean ending the relationship between humans and nature, but reordering it \u2013 recognizing nature\u2019s intrinsic worth and respecting indigenous philosophies. In the US and elsewhere, I believe we can do better to align our legal system with the cultural expressions of the people it serves. For instance, Congress could amend the NHPA or the American Indian Religious Freedom Act to acknowledge the deep cultural connection between tribes and natural places, and afford better protections for sacred landscapes like New Mexico\u2019s Mount Taylor. Until then, it says much about us when companies are considered people before nature is. This article originally appeared on The Conversation",

        "article": "Illustrated. 352 pp. New York: W. W. Norton & Company. $24.95. By Jay M. Gould and Benjamin A. Goldman with Kate Millpointer. Illustrated. 222 pp. New York: Four Walls Eight Windows. $19.95. ''Socialism is Soviet power plus electrification of the whole country,'' Lenin said in 1921 when he introduced his program to bring his nation into the industrial 20th century. Even today the centrality of that tenet to Soviet economic philosophy can hardly be exaggerated. The Soviet Government has taken the production, and consumption, of electric power not just as an index of the nation's economic progress but as a metaphor for the health of its entire system. As Lenin initiated the country's electrification by developing its coal and oil resources, and Stalin and Khrushchev promoted heroic hydropower projects, so Mikhail S. Gorbachev made it his mission to accelerate the conversion of the Soviet Union to nuclear power. By 1986 the Soviet Union had the world's third largest nuclear program, after the United States and France. And Mr. Gorbachev's first five-year plan, adopted in February of that year, called for doubling the nation's nuclear capacity, from 11 percent of its electricity to 22 percent. But just two months later, on April 26, 1986, the accident at the nuclear reactor in Chernobyl, the largest plant in the Soviet Union, undermined Mr. Gorbachev's plan - and along with it many of the assumptions on which the nation was built. In ''The Legacy of Chernobyl,'' Zhores A. Medvedev, a biochemist who was exiled from the Soviet Union in 1973 and is now a research scientist for the National Institute for Medical Research in London, combines an exhaustive accounting of technical data with an insider's knowledge of the Soviet bureaucracy to synthesize a damning history of the Chernobyl affair, from its origins in the plant's primitive design and careless management to the economic and political crisis the accident precipitated. Using the same painstaking analysis that distinguished ''Nuclear Disaster in the Urals,'' Mr. Medvedev's now largely vindicated investigation of a devastating nuclear accident in the 1950's, he makes the Chernobyl disaster seem almost inevitable. The accident itself, Mr. Medvedev asserts, occurred not during the testing of a safety system, as official accounts have suggested, but during a belated attempt to install such a system, more than two years after the plant went on line. Disaster, he believes, was the inevitable result of the sequence of simple operator errors that, as fate had it, occurred in the wee hours of April 26. Mr. Medvedev also makes it clear that the haphazard, and often bungled, attempts to handle the Chernobyl disaster resulted not just from technical inadequacy but from a bureaucratic cover-up - of the accident itself and of its potential medical effects - that reached as high as the central ministerial level. Hundreds of thousands of Soviet people were exposed to dangerous levels of radioactivity because they were not evacuated, and even today many remain exposed as they eat food from and live in irradiated areas, mainly Byelorussia and the Ukraine. Many of these accusations, which were first made in the Soviet press last fall, point in the direction of Yuri A. Izrael, chairman of the State Committee on Hydrometeorology, which kept radiological data hidden from the public, and Yevgeny I. Chazov, the Minister of Health, who played down the biological impact of radiation. The long-term effects of Chernobyl have yet to play themselves out. Ultimately, Mr. Medvedev suggests, cleanup costs could exceed the Soviet Union's entire investment to date in its nuclear capacity. And, he believes, Chernobyl was the catalyst for some of the momentous political and economic changes now taking place. By exposing institutional weaknesses within the Soviet bureaucracy, he writes, the affair forced the examination of the system's ills that became perestroika; and by trespassing international boundaries, the tragedy forced the public admissions from high-ranking Government officials that became the first glimmerings of glasnost. Moreover, the accident triggered an interest in conserving energy. An antinuclear - and, in turn, broadly environmental - movement has gathered across the Soviet Union, and that movement is now the foundation for the ''people's fronts,'' the vanguard of democratic and secessionist sentiments. If Mr. Medvedev faults the Soviet bureaucracy mainly for its reflexive silence on Chernobyl, Jay M. Gould and Benjamin A. Goldman, the authors of ''Deadly Deceit,'' take pains to demonstrate a history of active deception in American bureaucracies. They contend that the United States Energy and Defense Departments, and even certain state health offices, have falsified data in order to hide the health effects on Americans of both the distant Chernobyl accident and the radiation that has been released by bomb tests, weapons facilities and power plants here.",

        "article": "Rosalyn S. Yalow, a medical physicist who persisted in entering a field largely reserved for men to become only the second woman to earn a Nobel Prize in Medicine, died on Monday in the Bronx, where she had lived most of her life. She was 89. Her son, Benjamin Yalow, confirmed her death. Dr. Yalow, a product of New York City schools and the daughter of parents who never finished high school, graduated magna cum laude from Hunter College in New York at the age of 19 and was the college\u2019s first physics major. Yet she struggled to be accepted for graduate studies. In one instance, a skeptical Midwestern university wrote: \u201cShe is from New York. She is Jewish. She is a woman.\u201d Undeterred, she went on to carve out a renowned career in medical research, largely at a Bronx veterans hospital, and in the 1950s became a co-discoverer of the radioimmunoassay, an extremely sensitive way to measure insulin and other hormones in the blood. The technique invigorated the field of endrocrinology, making possible major advances in diabetes research and in diagnosing and treating hormonal problems related to growth, thyroid function and fertility. The test is used, for example, to prevent mental retardation in babies with underactive thyroid glands. No symptoms are present until a baby is more than 3 months old, too late to prevent brain damage. But a few drops of blood from a pinprick on the newborn\u2019s heel can be analyzed with radioimmunoassay to identify babies at risk. The technique \u201cbrought a revolution in biological and medical research,\u201d the Karolinska Institute in Sweden said in awarding Dr. Yalow the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1977. \u201cWe are witnessing the birth of a new era of endocrinology, one that started with Yalow,\u201d the institute said. Dr. Yalow developed radioimmunoassay with her longtime collaborator, Dr. Solomon A. Berson. Their work challenged what was then accepted wisdom about the immune system; skeptical medical journals initially refused to publish their findings unless they were modified. Dr. Berson died in 1972, before Dr. Yalow was honored with the Nobel. The institute does not make awards posthumously. Dr. Yalow was the second woman to win the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. The first, in 1947, was Gerty Theresa Cori, an American born in Prague. Dr. Yalow shared her Nobel with two other scientists for unrelated research. (Eight more women have won the medicine prize since then.) Rosalyn Sussman was born in the South Bronx on July 19, 1921. Her father, Simon Sussman, who had moved from the Lower East Side of Manhattan to the Bronx, was a wholesaler of packaging materials; her mother, the former Clara Zipper, who was born in Germany, was a homemaker. Dr. Yalow told interviewers that she had known from the time she was 8 years old that she wanted to be a scientist in an era when women were all but prohibited from science careers. She loved the logic of science and its ability to explain the natural world, she said. At Walton High School in the Bronx, she wrote, a \u201cgreat\u201d teacher had excited her interest in chemistry. (She was one of two Walton graduates, both women, to earn a Nobel in medicine, the other being Gertrude Elion, in 1988. Walton was closed in 2008 as a failing school.) Her interests gravitated to physics after she read Eve Curie\u2019s 1937 biography of her mother, Marie Curie, a two-time Nobel laureate for her research on radioactivity. Nuclear physics \u201cwas the most exciting field in the world,\u201d Dr. Yalow wrote in her official Nobel autobiography. \u201cIt seemed as if every major experiment brought a Nobel Prize.\u201d She went on to Hunter College, becoming its first physics major and graduating with high honors at only 19. After she applied to Purdue University for a graduate assistantship to study physics, the university wrote back to her professor: \u201cShe is from New York. She is Jewish. She is a woman. If you can guarantee her a job afterward, we\u2019ll give her an assistantship.\u201d No guarantee was possible, and the rejection hurt, Dr. Yalow told an interviewer. \u201cThey told me that as a woman, I\u2019d never get into graduate school in physics,\u201d she said, \u201cso they got me a job as a secretary at the College of Physicians and Surgeons and promised that, if I were a good girl, I would take courses there.\u201d The college is part of Columbia University. World War II and the draft were creating academic opportunities for women; to her delight, Dr. Yalow was awarded a teaching assistantship at the College of Engineering at the University of Illinois. She tore up her steno books and headed to Champaign-Urbana, becoming the first woman to join the engineering school\u2019s faculty in 24 years. Gina Kolata and Daniel E. Slotnik contributed reporting.",

She reported for the United Press International wire service for almost 60 years. Among the most-recognized reporters in America, Ms. Thomas was a short, dark-eyed woman with a gravelly voice who, for many years, rose from her front-row seat at presidential news conferences to ask the first or second question. For nearly 30 years, she closed the sessions with a no-nonsense \u201cThank you, Mr. President.\u201d \u201cHelen was a true pioneer, opening doors and breaking down barriers for generations of women in journalism,\u201d President Obama said in a statement. \u201cShe covered every White House since President Kennedy\u2019s, and during that time she never failed to keep presidents \u2014 myself included \u2014 on their toes.\u201d Ms. Thomas\u2019s pointed queries often agitated the powerful, but she was also lauded for posing questions \u201calmost like a housewife in Des Moines would ask,\u201d a colleague once said. She asked President Richard M. Nixon point-blank what his secret plan to end the Vietnam War was, and she asked President Ronald Reagan what right the United States had to invade Grenada in 1983. When President George H.W. Bush announced that the defense budget would remain the same after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the fall of the Berlin Wall and the disappearance of communism in Europe, she succinctly asked, \u201cWho\u2019s the enemy?\u201d \u201cI respect the office of the presidency,\u201d she told Ann McFeatters for a 2006 profile in Ms. magazine, \u201cbut I never worship at the shrines of our public servants. They owe us the truth.\u201d Ms. Thomas had a number of scoops, including her exclusive interviews with Martha Mitchell, which helped expose some aspects of the Watergate scandal. Mitchell, the wife of Attorney General John Mitchell, told Thomas in late-night phone calls that she had seen a Nixon campaign strategy book that included plans for Watergate-style operations. Thomas also broke the story that Nixon's speechwriters were working on a resignation address that he would give the next day. Her strength was her indefatigable pursuit of hard news, the bread-and-butter staple of the wire services. She arrived at work every morning before dawn and accompanied nine presidents on overseas trips. She was the only female print reporter to accompany Nixon on his historic visit to China, and later, in her 70s and 80s, she often outdistanced younger reporters on arduous around-the-world travels. Her unparalleled experience covering the presidency earned her the respect and affection of both colleagues and public officials for decades.",

        "article": "Liam Fox put the security of himself and his officials at \"risk\" on overseas visits by releasing details of his diary to Adam Werritty, the cabinet secretary Sir Gus O'Donnell has concluded in his report into the former defence secretary. In a damning assessment of Fox, O'Donnell said that the former defence secretary was guilty of multiple breaches of the ministerial code after \"blurring\" the lines between his private and official responsibilities. O'Donnell said: \"Dr Fox's actions clearly constitute a breach of the ministerial code which Dr Fox has already acknowledged. This was a failure of judgment on his part for which he has taken the ultimate responsibility in resigning office.\" Downing Street immediately announced David Cameron had accepted O'Donnell's report, which recommended a tightening of the rules governing relations between ministers and civil servants. But there was criticism after No 10 delayed publication of the report until 5.30pm. Fox had hoped to make a personal statement to the Commons on Tuesday afternoon. Sir George Young, the Commons leader, will make a statement to MPs on Wednesday. Liam Fox said: \"I am pleased that the report makes clear that the two most serious allegations, namely of any financial gain sought, expected or received by myself and any breach of national security, have no basis. As I said in the House of Commons last week, I accept that it was a mistake to allow the distinctions between government and private roles to become blurred, and I must take my share of the responsibility for this. \"More care should have been taken to avoid the impression that anyone other than ministers and officials were speaking on behalf of the government, as this was not the case. Although there were no actual conflicts of interest I acknowledge that in order to avoid any possible perception of this, all private interests should have been fully declared to the permanent secretary. \"I welcome the recommendations in this report, which will provide greater clarity for ministers, officials and private individuals in the future.\" In a 10-page report, which explains why Fox resigned so abruptly on Friday, O'Donnell found that the former defence secretary had: \u2022 Put officials at risk by disclosing details of future overseas visits to Werritty. \"The disclosure outside MoD of diary details about future visits overseas posed a degree of security risk not only to Dr Fox, but also to the accompanying official party. Dr Fox has accepted that such disclosures were not appropriate.\" \u2022 Ignored concerns from Ursula Brennan, his permanent secretary. \"The risks of Dr Fox's association with Mr Werritty were raised with Dr Fox by both his private office and the permanent secretary. Dr Fox took action in respect of business cards but clearly made a judgment that his contact with Mr Werritty should continue.\" \u2022 Wrongly allowed Werritty to attend a meeting in September last year with Matthew Gould, then the British ambassador designate to Israel. \"As a private citizen, however, with no official locus, it was not appropriate for Mr Werritty to have attended this meeting. Dr Fox has since acknowledged this. This highlights the blurring of lines between Dr Fox's private and official responsibilities which he has since acknowledged was not appropriate and not acceptable.\" \u2022 Mistakenly met Harvey Boulter in Dubai on 17 June with Werritty with no MoD officials present. \"Dr Fox has acknowledged that conducting this meeting without a private secretary present was unwise and inappropriate.\" \u2022 Allowed the appearance of a perception of a conflict of interest after arranging for Werritty to meet a donor to Pargav, the company that funded his trips. \"The links between Dr Fox and Mr Werritty means that the donations given to Mr Werritty could at least be seen as giving rise to the perception of a conflict of interest.\" \u2022 Failed to inform Brennan of his friendship with Werritty. \"He should have declared to his permanent secretary that Mr Werritty was a friend who had a company, Pargav, which was funded by a number of donors, some of whom had provided funding to Dr Fox when in opposition.\" \u2022 Fuelled a \"general impression\" that Werritty spoke on behalf of the British government through his \"close and visible association\" with his friend who used \"misleading business cards\". Printed with the parliamentary Portcullis, these described him as an adviser to Fox. O'Donnell, who said that Fox's former supporter Jon Moulton had contacted him, named the supporters of Pargav. They are: Oceana Investments, Jon Moulton, G3 Ltd, Tamares, IRG Ltd and Michael Davies. O'Donnell concluded his report with a series of recommendations designed to prevent a repeat of the lax way in which Fox met Werritty and other business people overseas without officials. These will mean: \u2022 Ministers will have to inform their department if they discusss \"substantive issues\" with external organisations when no officials are present. \u2022 Departments should clarify who is, and who is not, a member of a ministerial visit overseas. \u2022 Officials should accompany ministers to all meetings overseas where official business is discussed. \u2022 Permanent secretaries should discuss with new ministers whether any acquaintances or advisers have contractual relationships with a department or whether they are involved in policy development,",

        "article": "It\u2019s been a year since the Cereal Killer cafe in London\u2019s Brick Lane became the focus of an anti-gentrification riot, and its owners received letters saying \u201cdie hipsters\u201d. To be fair, not everyone was hostile to the cafe: the morning after the riot in which protesters daubed the word \u201cscum\u201d on the shop window, there were queues of customers paying up to \u00a34.50 for a bowl of cereal. So how will Birmingham react when a branch of the cafe opens at Link Street in the Bullring next month? With greater sangfroid than excitable Londoners, is my guess. Or maybe not. The second city is already divided \u2013 and not only between Villa and Blues fans. On the one side, there are those expressing their fabulously downbeat Brummie ennui on Twitter: \u201c2016 carries on its reckless march toward societal collapse: cereal cafe to open in Birmingham,\u201d tweets Hinkypunka. On the other side is the Birmingham Evening Mail, which exclaims: \u201cWe\u2019re cerealously excited!\u201d (There\u2019s no excuse for that kind of language.) \u201cThe people behind this super cool cafe,\u201d adds the Mail with heroic journalistic objectivity, \u201cwill be whipping up all of our favourite treats like Fluff, popping candy chocolate, party rings, hundreds and thousands, jelly and choccie milk and turning them into crazy good snacks.\u201d I know what you\u2019re thinking: choccie isn\u2019t a word. Or if it is, it kind of proves the point about 2016\u2019s march to societal collapse. My sister, who lives in Birmingham\u2019s Acocks Green, has a different reaction. \u201cOne word \u2013 beds!\u201d she texts me. When a second London branch opened in Camden Town last year, there weren\u2019t just bog-standard tables and chairs \u2013 but a whole row of beds, many of them featuring 90s-era duvet covers like the Super Mario Brothers. Whether this innovation is an abomination or ergonomic boon depends on your politics. It may lead to punters queuing for breakfast clutching teddy bears in their PJs, though, in a fine prefiguring of the end of days. A Cereal Killer cafe is opening in Birmingham, like we need over-priced hipster crap My brother, meanwhile, has a further intriguing perspective: \u201cNot far from Jamie\u2019s Italian. Wonder what he would make of it? Hardly the answer to the nation\u2019s obesity problems.\u201d Quite so; the celebrity chef Jamie Oliver has long been a campaigner for reduced sugar in British food, especially in dishes targeted at children. But the Cereal Killer cafe boasts (if that\u2019s the word) cereals like S\u2019Mores, Superman and Trix, as well as Chocapic from France, Kariot from Israel and Milo from Australia. What\u2019s that noise? It\u2019s my arteries furring at the prospect. But let\u2019s set aside health issues and focus on the real reason people care about the Cereal Killer cafe: the social transformation it apparently implies. \u201cOh geez,\u201d tweets Aceman, \u201ca Cereal Killer cafe is opening in Birmingham, like we need over-priced hipster crap.\u201d Hold on, Aceman. Perhaps I don\u2019t understand gentrification, but this kind of retail development doesn\u2019t seem of a piece with what hipster culture usually means: the craft beers, beards and overpriced Jewellery Quarter apartments. Hipsters, surely, are more like the earnest young Texan couple terrorised by anti-gentrification campaigner Lillian Kaushtupper in The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. They arrive in town looking for authentic signifiers of old New York \u2013 soul food restaurants, off-the-grid thrift stores \u2013 rather than the commodified, themed, pre-packaged retro eating experience the Cereal Killer cafe offers. Surely gentrification is more like what happened in South Park when an eyesore neighbourhood was redeveloped into the funky-sounding SoDo SoPa (short for \u201csouth of downtown South Park\u201d), and whose new identity was validated by the arrival of a branch of Whole Foods. If the Cereal Killer cafe offers gentrification, it\u2019s not what it used to be. Without wishing to be snobbish (there\u2019s no good way this sentence can end), I suspect that those most titillated by the arrival in Birmingham of the cafe are in the same demographic as those wowed by the roll-out of at-table service at all 18 Birmingham McDonald\u2019s branches. And yet it arrives at a poised moment for the city. Earlier this month, it was revealed that more than 6,000 people left London for England\u2019s second city last year \u2013 more appealing to capital quitters than the second, third and fourth most popular destinations (Brighton, Thurrock and Epping Forest, respectively) \u2013 which are all within 50 miles of London. The data was glossed thus by Jay Islaam in the Guardian: \u201cLondoners, you live in a malodorous rat-pit. Come to Birmingham instead.\u201d Gotta love that Brummie hospitality: welcoming you with one hand and giving you the finger with the other. But here\u2019s my worry: it\u2019s quite possible that one reason Birmingham became appealing to unhappy Londoners is precisely because it didn\u2019t, until now, have a branch of the Cereal Killer cafe. Those who quit the rat-pit sought an escape from the branded and commodified \u201cexperience dining\u201d that London offers in crazy numbers. Perhaps the next set of internal migration figures will show Birmingham being supplanted as a destination for Londoners by a city that has kept it real: Wolverhampton or Sunderland for instance. Birmingham, just possibly, may be becoming a victim of its own success. Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter and Facebook and join the discussion",

        "article": "The frontier of biomedical research is inside an unassuming green box with a black-and-white touchscreen mounted on a rack in the International Space Station. Within that green box is a microplate reader, a workhorse appliance in labs on Earth but the first of its kind to work in the near-zero gravity at 250 miles up. A microplate reader screens hundreds of liquid samples at once for drug candidates or infectious disease, but fluids at zero Gs can float around or settle in unwanted ways. This barred scientists from using microplates in space, where researchers prize the absence of gravity for its insights into how crystals, bacteria and drug agents behave. Solving that problem was one small step for a tiny company called NanoRacks, which has carved out an unusual niche (and a monopoly, for now) adapting lab gear to the U.S. National Lab on the ISS. Since 2010 it has designed and built all 36 of the modular labs there. It has also acquired for the ISS two microscopes and a centrifuge that can simulate the gravity on, say, the moon or Mars. NanoRacks has flown 70 payloads to the ISS and is contracted to fly 80 more. Last year it generated more than $3 million in revenue, of which only one-quarter comes from NASA. Other customers include European and Saudi space agencies, universities in the U.K. and Vietnam, and even Scotch distiller Ardbeg, which sent up flavor molecules called terpenes to age for two years in charred oak (more on that experiment here). NanoRacks\u2019 entrepreneurial approach has cut the cost of doing science in space just as Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX has shown that startups can deliver payloads safely and more cheaply than governments can. NASA told NanoRacks that a space-ready microplate reader would take years and cost millions. \u201cWe told them we could do it in six months for less than a million,\u201d says NanoRacks managing director Jeffrey Manber. NanoRacks ended up doing it for $500,000 and even gave NASA the same money-back guarantee it offers commercial customers. \u201cWe\u2019ve only done that one other time,\u201d says Marybeth Edeen, who manages the U.S. National Lab aboard the space station. \u201cIt\u2019s a good model in that incentivizes companies to build robust hardware.\u201d To make its microplate reader space-ready, NanoRacks had to tweak the capillary action of its 96 tiny wells to ensure that liquids were placed correctly on a slide and had to dumb down the machine\u2019s user interface so an untrained astronaut could use it. \u201cWhen astronaut Kevin Ford turned it on and ran the initial experiment, we had to wait for it to run overnight,\u201d says Manber. \u201cWe had trouble sleeping. But in the morning we downloaded the data, and it was perfect.\u201d NanoRacks charges roughly $60,000 for each microplate reader experiment and is getting a lot more new customers beyond NASA, so it shouldn\u2019t take the company too long to get a return on its investment. \u201cWe were profitable last year, and we\u2019ll be profitable this year,\u201d says Richard Pournelle, NanoRacks\u2019 senior vice president for business development.",

Another billet doux inviting hostile congressional Republicans to please sit around the campfire and sing \u201cKumbaya\u201d wouldn\u2019t have cut it. What Obama did, instead, was issue a challenge -- and, not incidentally, lay out the opening themes of his reelection campaign. Perhaps the most significant line in Obama\u2019s speech was his promise to take his jobs message to the people in \u201cevery corner of the country.\u201d He told the assembled members of Congress that if they balk at passing his American Jobs Act, he will go over their heads. That answered the obvious question: What does Obama intend to do when House Republicans ball up his bill and throw it in the trash? The measures Obama proposed are eminently reasonable. Who could argue with repairing the nation\u2019s infrastructure, modernizing our children\u2019s schools or providing jobs for brave returning veterans? The program is full of tons of GOP-friendly tax cuts, and it will be entertaining to watch Republicans twist themselves into pretzels to reject so many of their own ideas. But reject them they surely will. The party\u2019s campaign message for 2012 is that Obama is always wrong about everything. At this point, does anyone expect John Boehner and Mitch McConnell to say, \u201cGreat ideas, Mr. President, we\u2019ll get all this stuff right through.\u201d Senate Republicans will threaten to filibuster and House Republicans will just say no. Then what? \u201cWe are not going to be overly concerned about their initial answer,\u201d a senior administration official said in an interview before the speech. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to say, \u2018Okay, we\u2019re going back to the drawing board.\u2019 We are going to make the case for this.\u201d The senior official said the president\u2019s package, which will cost $447 billion, should create between 1.5 million and 2 million jobs and perhaps boost GDP by 2 percentage points. Those sound like pretty generous estimates to me. Even if they aren\u2019t, by Election Day the economy would hardly be roaring. Unemployment would be lower, but still painfully high. Conditions still wouldn\u2019t be ideal for an incumbent president seeking reelection. But if -- I mean, when -- Republicans reject Obama\u2019s jobs agenda, the president will be able to tell voters that he\u2019ll never stop fighting for jobs and prosperity -- and that Republicans will never stop defending tax breaks for \u201cmillionaires and billionaires.\u201d I think the campaign just began.

        "article": "R.J. Reynolds Industries, the nation's leading producer of cigarettes, reported yesterday that earnings in the first quarter moved up 2.4 percent on a sales increase of 14.9 percent. The diversified Winston-Salem, N.C., company said that net income in the three months rose to $188.3 million, from $183.8 million. Sales climbed to $2.77 billion, from $2.41 billion. J. Paul Sticht, chairman and chief executive of Reynolds, said that the small increase in earnings was achieved despite lower levels of investment tax credits and capitalization interest. He said that together these items were 12 cents a share less than in the first quarter of 1980. Consolidated earnings from operations were up 9.2 percent in the quarter to $367.4 million, from $336.3 million. Mr. Sticht called earnings from operations ''a good measure of the strength of our operations,'' but added that ''the year-to-year comparison is difficult because the 1980 first quarter was so exceptionally strong.'' Domestic tobacco sales for the first quarter rose 14.1 percent, to $859.1 million, from $753 million. Earnings from operations rose 17 percent, to $216.8 million, from $185.3 million. International tobacco sales edged up 1.4 percent, to $551 million, from $543.5 million, while earnings from operations in that sector shrank 19.8 percent, to $51.9 million, from $62.2 million. Reynolds said that higher selling prices and excise taxes, combined with a favorable sales mix, offset the negative impact of a stronger dollar in translating foreign currency sales. Reynolds said that energy sales soared 66.2 percent to $364.3 million, from $219.2 million, primarily because of higher prices.R.J. Reynolds Industries is the parent of the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, the Del Monte Corporation, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco International, Aminoil USA Inc., Sea-Land Industries Investments and the R.J. Reynolds Development Corporation. Burlington Industries Burlington Industries Inc., the country's biggest manufacturer of textile products, announced that net income in the second fiscal quarter of 1981 ended March 28 dropped 7.7 percent, to $27.6 million, or 98 cents a share, from $29.9 million, or $1.06 a share, in the corresponding quarter of the preceding fiscal year. Sales increased 6.4 percent, to $799.5 million, from $751.4 million. ''Apparel results were reasonably satisfactory considering the changing pattern of retail demand for our products,'' said William A. Klopman, Burlington's chairman and chief executive. ''The knit business, however, continued to perform poorly.'' Mr. Klopman said that several segments of Burlington's home furnishing group improved from the December quarter but that the domestics area was seasonally weaker. ''A lack of strength in housing, along with high interest rates, continued to impact this group,'' Mr. Klopman said. Gillette The Gillette Company, a diversified consumer products company, reported that net income in the first quarter dropped 12.3 percent, to $32.2 million, or $1.07 a share, from $36.7 million, or $1.21 a share, in the 1980 quarter. Sales increased 6.8 percent, to $588.2 million, from $550.9 million. Colman M. Mockler Jr., chairman and chief executive of the Andover, Mass., concern, said that both sales and earnings in the first quarter were hurt by exchange rates for foreign currencies, which were significantly below those in the first quarter of 1980. Weyerhaeuser The Weyerhaeuser Company, the country's largest wood products concern, announced that net income in the first quarter plunged 48.6 percent, to $57 million, or 43 cents a share, from $111 million, or 86 cents a share, in 1980's first quarter. Sales dropped 12.2 percent to $1.01 billion, from $1.15 billion. Like many other forest products concerns, Weyerhaeuser, based in Tacoma, Wash., was hard hit by the slowdown in the housing industry. Analysts maintain, however, that sales should show progress in the second half, bolstered by firmer wood products and paper prices. ---- Earnings tables, page D4.",

        "article": "Turned, the tables have been. After what seems like light-years of griping about the fact that Netflix users get more (and sometimes better) titles in the U.S., Canadians will soon have exclusive access to something our American friends might actually install a VPN for: Star Wars: The Force Awakens. A representative from Netflix confirmed to CBC News on Sunday that Canada is its only territory in which streaming rights for the hotly-anticipated forthcoming Star Wars film has been secured. \"The reason Netflix will be able to offer the much-anticipated movie in Canada next year \u2014 and not in the U.S. or anywhere else \u2014 has to do with the timing of when Disney's pay-TV distribution deals were up for grabs,\" reports Variety, which broke the news Friday. Netflix confirmed to CBC News that Canada is its only territory with streaming rights for Star Wars: The Force Awakens. (Paul Sakuma/Associated Press) According to Variety's report, Disney does have a content deal with Netflix in the U.S. \u2014 but it won't commence until 2016. Films with theatrical debuts in 2015 still fall under Disney's current output deal with American premium cable channel Starz. Star Wars: The Force Awakens is slated to hit theatres Dec. 18 of this year, giving Starz alone the exclusive rights to stream it in the U.S. Canada, on the other hand, boasts a slightly different situation. \"Fortuitously for Netflix Canada subs, the company's deal with Disney started with 2015 releases after the previous agreements for the pay-TV window with Corus Entertainment and Bell Canada expired,\" Variety explains. \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens is slated to come to the service in the country; under the terms of the deal, that will occur approximately eight months after the movie leaves theatres.\" Anticipation for The Force Awakens, the seventh film in the blockbuster Star Wars franchise, is extremely high. To say the least. Last week, Lucasfilm unveiled the movie's official poster and two short teaser videos to promote a new trailer. The trailer, set to air during the halftime segment of Monday Night Football Oct. 19, was meant to air immediately before tickets for the theatrical release of the film went on sale. Eager fans swarmed online ticketing sites earlier that day, however, prompting several to crash under the demand. Vue Cinemas reported selling 10,000 tickets in just 90 minutes, while the U.K.'s Picturehouse chain reported \"unprecedented\" demand. Based on early excitement over the film, it stands to reason that some U.S. Netflix subscribers may feel a bit jealous of Canadians when it starts streaming. Some may even attempt to subvert Netflix's geoblocking restrictions by making it look as though they have Canadian I.P. addresses. Who'd have thought the day would come? Rev up your Canadian VPN end points because Netflix will only stream the new 'Star Wars' in Canada next year - https://t.co/ahvb4gl5P5 Sweet Mountie Justice! Canadians have all the luck... https://t.co/vsVzy4Fqbq pic.twitter.com/1oZNaNR4e6 And, naturally, many Canadians are stoked to have some online content exclusivity cred for once. Canada may not be able to buy some Marvel home video releases but we're the only country get Star Wars 7 on Netflix next year :) The Force is strong with Canada, yo! https://t.co/Z37JHaYrSu Canadian Netflix gets to stream Star Wars Episode VII first. See, this is what happens when people get nice things for being nice. For the record, Canadians can also view such unavailable-in-the-U.S. Netflix titles as Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, Coneheads, and the original Air Bud.",

Winners of TripAdvisor's 2011 Travelers' Choice Family Awards were chosen based on the greatest number of recommendations from reviewers who traveled with family. PHOTO GALLERY: See TripAdvisor's top picks What's absent from the Top 10 list? Pricey New York City, which is filled with cultural treasures for children, but where you can easily pay $40 a night in hotel taxes alone, excluding room rate. Family travel is an increasingly important segment of the travel industry that hotels - regardless seek to encourage. When the just-opened dual Renaissance and Residence Inn hotel in government contractor hub Crystal City, Va., for instance, was choosing between installing mini-bar systems or empty mini-refrigerators in guest rooms, family travel played a role. The hotel decided to install refrigerators partly because they'll appeal to families who general manager Jerry Caliguire expects to host on weekends. Despite a location amid mammoth office buildings, some families stay in these hotels as part of tour groups or to use as an affordable base for Washington D.C. sightseeing, sporting competitions or other local events, he told me. According to a recent TripAdvisor survey, 83% of U.S. respondents plan to travel with family in 2011 with 90% of them planning domestic trips. The Top 10 list for \"Great U.S. Destinations to Discover\" is dominated by just four states: Virginia, Texas, Florida and Tennessee. To stay in these top 10 places, expect to pay an average of $215 per night, TripAdvisor says.

        "article": "Warren Buffett likes to say that you only find out who has been swimming naked when the tide goes out. With earnings season looming, investors also should be careful with companies that appear fully clothed. The first quarter was another tough one. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S estimate earnings for S&P 500 companies fell by 7.5% from a year earlier. It is the kind of environment in which the shares of companies that are able to keep notching good results are richly rewarded. The trouble is those rewards can also tempt companies to overstep the bounds for fear of swift punishment. For a recent project, Patricia Dechow, an accounting professor at the University of California, Berkeley\u2019s Haas School of Business, and three co-authors screened for nonfinancial firms that were subject to enforcement actions for misstating earnings at some point between 1994 and 2010. They then looked at how their earnings compared with analyst estimates during the misstatement period. Their finding: 53% of misstating firms topped estimates for at least four consecutive quarters versus 43% for other firms. That is significant. For an example of a company that, until recently, was racking up impressive earnings stats, investors need look no further than Valeant Pharmaceuticals International. VRX 1.76 % In the five years that ended in last year\u2019s third quarter, it topped analysts\u2019 median estimates 18 times and met them twice. The streak ended last month when Valeant finally released unaudited fourth-quarter results that fell short of estimates. Now, doubts are swirling over Valeant\u2019s past results. It has said that it wrongly booked $58 million in revenue in 2014, that it is under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and that it is unsure when it will file audited 2015 financials. Its stock is nearly 90% below its peak in August. While the book isn\u2019t yet closed on what happened at Valeant, investors should consider if estimate-beating results weren\u2019t actually a warning sign. As they ponder that, investors should consider a broader question: What leads a company to game earnings? One theory is greed: Management wants to push the stock higher. Another theory says it is fear: Management is worried about seeing the stock tank. It looks like fear plays the greater role. The researchers found that forward price/earnings multiples for companies with strings of earnings beats that fell afoul of the SEC were elevated before the period when they misstated earnings. During the misstatement period, valuations tended to stay rich, but not get any richer. So the probable explanation is that companies generally got rewarded with P/E ratios on a run of good results, but weren\u2019t able to keep delivering. For managers who had been enjoying the fruits of a high valuation, this was hard to take. An especially big worry: Shares of companies with a history of positive earnings surprises tend to get severely punished after misses. So that raises the stakes for these companies. And those are particularly high today when overall U.S. profits have been flagging after a long period of growth\u2014the tide is going out. Before rewarding a company that seemingly has avoided the earnings slowdown, investors need to be sure it isn\u2019t just wearing the emperor\u2019s new swimming suit.",

        "article": "I received a call today from a reporter asking me if Mitt Romney lost because of talk radio and the Tea Party and whether the GOP had to soften its views to appeal to women and to Latinos. Funny, the media pushed that same narrative after the GOP's 2006 midterm wipe-out and after McCain's 2008 loss to Obama. Let me just tell you, if anything, Mitt Romney distanced himself from much of the talk radio world. He made only three brief appearances on my radio show over the past year. And his campaign was livid when I had the nerve to ask the Governor, whom I endorsed by the way in 2008, how he planned to win the election if the economy showed signs of improvement. The fact is talk radio continues to thrive while moderate Republicans like John McCain and to some extent Mitt Romney continue to lose presidential elections. And while the Tea Party has backed some terrible candidates... Richard Mourdock, Todd Akin and Christine O'Donnell, it also made the 2010 GOP route possible. Grass roots conservatives helped elect Senators Marco Rubio in Florida, Ted Cruz in Texas, and this time Deb Fisher in that Nebraska senate race. Where is the evidence that pro-abortion or pro-gay marriage or pro- amnesty but fiscally conservative candidates are the solution to the GOP's problem? Moderates like Scott Brown and Charlie Summers just lost their senate races in Massachusetts and Maine. Both blue states. Would their type of Republican have won in conservative red states? Of course not. Until more liberal Republicans start winning their races, why should they dictate the terms of a new GOP agenda? Yes, Republicans of course need to attract more single women and Latinos. But pandering isn't the answer. Good policy and good politics is. I don't think it's any harder to convince more Hispanics or more single women to be conservative than it was to convince let's say Irish Catholics or Italian immigrants who are New Deal or JFK Democrats to become conservatives during the Reagan area. If you believe like I do that conservative social and economic policies are the best hope for the nation, then abandoning your positions to try to become more popular is a path to complete irrelevance. Did Barack Obama moderate his views after the 2010 midterms? Did he roll back parts of ObamaCare? Did he stop green energy subsidies? Nope, instead he aggressively pursued his liberal agenda by executive order and with new smart messaging and he won re-election. - You can catch Bill O'Reilly's \"Talking Points Memo\" weeknights at 8 and 11 p.m. ET on the Fox News Channel and any time on foxnews.com/oreilly.

        "article": "The papers this morning were full of the so-called \"dawn raid\" on Newark \u2013 the Tories\u2019 latest campaigning wheeze. At quarter to five this morning, Conservative campaign teams fanned across the constituency, delivering an early-morning reminder to cast a vote for the Conservative candidate, Robert Jenrick. If the briefing is intended to put the fear of God into the Tories\u2019 opponents, it seems to be having the reverse effect in some quarters. \u201cI don\u2019t get it,\u201d one Liberal Democrat organiser told me, \u201cWhat were they doing differently before?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s like they\u2019ve just discovered that canvassing works better if you get people to do it,\u201d was the verdict of one Labour staffer. Early morning starts. Campaign centres across the constituency. Among the enemies of the Tory party, there is both private and public amusement that these much-briefed \"innovations\" have been the hallmark of successful Liberal Democrat and Labour campaigns for the past 20 years or more. If these are the Tories\u2019 brand new ideas for winning a majority, Labour figures argue, there\u2019s little to fear. As for Team 2015 \u2013 Grant Shapps\u2019 crack team of young volunteers, lured in by the prospect of free food and sex with likeminded people \u2013 Labour staffers are, for the most part, sanguine about this threat. \u201cThe opportunity to get laid has been the driving force in the Labour Party since Kinnock got rid of the Militant Tendency,\u201d one says. There are still aspects of the Tory machine that lag far behind its opponents. Visiting Newark, I happened on the president of the local association, handing out balloons with the Tory logo on them to small children. Parents fixed him with a rictus grin while tying the balloon to their spawn before hurrying off. Other than proving that children like a) balloons and b) the colour blue, I\u2019m uncertain what meaningful data was being collected. In 2010, the Tory campaign was outclassed by Labour\u2019s rearguard action. Parliamentary candidates were frequently self-defeating \u2013 both Conservative and Labour campaigners believe that the selection of Shaun Bailey in Hammersmith was a gift to the Labour incumbent, Andy Slaughter \u2013 while in many marginals, the Conservative campaign consisted almost entirely of direct mail. The pattern revealed in successive Ashcroft polls and in Newark is of a party that is finally starting to get wise to modern campaign techniques. Even these fitful steps into 20th century campaigning are the cause of concern in some quarters, however. A Labour organiser in a seat that the party held by a whisker in 2010 agrees. \u201cIt is worrying,\u201d he says, \u201cthat we seem to do quite badly [in terms of turnout] with such a vastly better operation.\u201d The same Liberal who greeted the initial leaks with amusement turns contemplative \u2013 and depressive \u2013 as the conversation goes on. \u201cI always thought we were roughly equal [on the ground],\u201d she says. If, she continues, the Tories have been taking a knife to a gun fight all these years, the prospect of them finally getting hold of a pistol is frightening, particularly to Labour, who, even shadow cabinet loyalists acknowledge, will lose the air campaign, and probably badly. That means that the Conservatives\u2019 breathless excitement about \"dawn raids\" are a cause of nerves as well as laughter.

Five pros share their most effective moves. A lot of folks have a habit of imparting endless information during a first encounter. I call it male-pattern lecturing, though it's by no means exclusive to men. The listener smiles, nods politely, and asks questions, and so the male-pattern lecturer keeps...on...talking. The lecturer comes away from the experience thinking that it went really well. He felt so confident and interesting! But for the listener, it was a bust. She didn't feel affirmed or appreciated. It's natural, especially when you're nervous, to focus on whether the conversation is going well for you. But make sure you're also thinking of ways to make the other person feel good. Honestly, that can be as simple as asking about her day. Ann Demarais, PH.D., is an executive coach and a coauthor of First Impressions ($15, amazon.com). RealSimple.com: How to be a good friend Not long ago, I had a business meeting scheduled with a woman whom I found intimidating. I expected to pull out all the stops to impress her. But as it happened, I was just not in the mood that day, so I found myself acting differently: I was raw, vulnerable, and honest -- and she responded in kind. Ultimately we had an amazing conversation, which came about because we had both let our guard down. The fact is, we are all walking around trying not to be human. We want to be these perfect little machines with no faults. But if I'm putting up a front and you are as well, what kind of conversation are we really having? Lucila McElroy is the founder of WeAreMomentum.com, a life-coaching company for mothers based in Maplewood, New Jersey. RealSimple.com: What to say in awkward social situations Use a Person's Name. Repeat. People love to hear their own names. It makes them feel special, like you're attuned to them. But don't stop there: Learn the names of other folks' spouses, children, and pets, too, then mention them in a follow-up e-mail or conversation. Asking, say, \"Did Madison choose a college yet?\" or \"Is Hal's tennis elbow still acting up?\" will go a long way toward solidifying an initial positive impression. Julie Albright is a sociologist at the University of Southern California, in Los Angeles, who studies social psychology and interpersonal relationships. RealSimple.com: Things worth admitting to Don't Take All the Credit When I interview a job candidate, I look to see if she is too self-serving. Does she appear to exaggerate her own contributions? Blame colleagues for things that went wrong? When you ask her to share her weaknesses, does she merely dress up her strengths? \"I care too much.\" \"I work too hard.\" (Ugh.) Just be humble, and let people know that you hold yourself to the same standards to which you hold others.

RealSimple.com: 5 everyday dangers not to worry about When your face is neutral, it indicates that you're not engaged. Just a slight head tilt powerfully conveys the message that you're listening. A quick eyebrow arch is another small but effective gesture that communicates curiosity. You often hear that you should mirror the body language of the person you're talking to, and that's true, to a point. For example, if someone is talking quietly, respond in a soft voice.

        "article": "Word Play: Confessions of a graphic-novel convert, or, the perfect bat mitzvah gift I am a latecomer to graphic novels. Years ago, my truly literary friends tried to turn me on to the groundbreaking art of the \"Sandman\" books (Neil Gaiman and various artists) and \"Love and Rockets\" (Los Bros. Hernandez). I admit I felt about those books the way I feel about great horror movies: I could admire the art, but they did not make my heart sing. When I was editor of the Los Angeles Times Book Review in the 1990s, I tried without success to get one or another of those literary friends to commit their intriguing ideas about the emerging world of graphic novels to a piece for the Book Review, but they were apparently keeping their enthusiasms to themselves and their aficionados. But graphic novels since then have come out into the literary open. Artists like Shaun Tan have stormed the gates of book prizes, and more classics than you can shake a stick at, fiction and nonfiction, have been translated into graphic format. There are at least four versions of the Anne Frank story, including, published just last month, Sid Jacobson and Ernie Colon's \"Anne Frank: The Anne Frank House Authorized Graphic Biography\" (Hill and Wang: $30 hardcover, $16.95 paper)! No graphic novel based on a classic has yet struck me as more than an amusing parlor trick, although the recent adaptation of Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00c3\u00a9ry's \"The Little Prince\" by French graphic-novel star Joann Sfar (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt: $19.99) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 reviewed in this Sunday's book coverage \u00e2\u0080\u0094 contains one brilliant visual riff. The original novella opened with Saint-Exup\u00c3\u00a9ry explaining he did not become an artist because grown-ups did not understand his drawings of boa constrictors digesting their prey; as a result, he studied things grown-ups consider serious and became a pilot. In Sfar's version, these musings take place while the author's plane is going down over the Sahara desert. The desperate pilot is conversing with a fantastic creature formed from his cigarette smoke (no one smokes like the French!), which at one point morphs into a boa constrictor and threatens to engulf him. The passage ends with the smoke-creature slyly admonishing the pilot: \"By the way, you shouldn't smoke in a book for young people.\"",

        "article": "Gay rights activists have reacted angrily to the Ugandan parliament's abrupt decision to pass anti-homosexuality laws that would condemn same-sex couples to life in jail for mere touching, urging president Yoweri Museveni to veto them. The bill, rushed through by MPs on Friday, also bans the promotion of homosexuality and makes it a crime punishable by prison not to report gay people to the authorities or to conduct a marriage ceremony for same-sex couples. The law was first introduced in 2009, when it advocated the death penalty, but after a worldwide outcry, that was removed from the final version. \"This is victory for Uganda,\" David Bahati, the MP who proposed the bill, was quoted as saying in media reports. \"I am glad the parliament has voted against evil. Because we are a God-fearing nation, we value life in a holistic way. It is because of those values that members of parliament passed this bill regardless of what the outside world thinks.\" The bill was reportedly tabled without prior notice. It was opposed by Ugandan prime minister Amama Mbabazi, who argued that not enough MPs were present for a quorum, a challenge that might yet discourage Museveni from signing the bill into law. The threat of a withdrawal of western aid could also play into his decision. Under existing Ugandan law, anyone found guilty of \"carnal knowledge against the order of nature\" can already face sentences up to life imprisonment. But Bahati argued that dramatically increased criminal penalties were needed to protect traditional lifestyles from western-funded groups who were \"recruiting\" Ugandan children into gay lifestyles. Critics of the bill claim that Ugandan political and religious leaders have come under the influence of American Christian evangelicals who, losing battles at home, are now pushing their values in Africa. They were swift to denounce the parliament's decision on Friday. Frank Mugisha, a leading Ugandan gay rights activist, said: \"This is a truly terrifying day for human rights in Uganda. It will open a new era of fear and persecution. If this law is signed by president Museveni, I'd be thrown in jail for life and in all likelihood killed. We urgently need world leaders to call on president Museveni and demand he stops this bill of hate from becoming law.\" More than a million people have backed Mugisha's campaign on the petition website Avaaz to stop the laws. Bishop Christopher Senyonjo, who was excommunicated from the Church of Uganda for his opposition to homophobia, said: \"I condemn it in very strong terms because it shows there's a lot of misinformation, misunderstanding, I could say ignorance about homosexuality. I still hope that with education people will understand. It takes time, but I believe things will change.\" Amnesty International joined calls for Museveni to knock back the bill. Aster van Kregten, its deputy Africa director, said: \"President Museveni must veto this wildly discriminatory legislation, which amounts to a grave assault on human rights and makes a mockery of the Ugandan constitution. \"Passing the anti-homosexuality bill was a retrograde step for Uganda's parliament, which has made some important progress on human rights in recent years, including criminalising torture. It flies in the face of the Ugandan government's stated commitment to ensure all legislation complies with human rights.\" Maria Burnett, a senior Africa researcher with Human Rights Watch, said the bill is \"still appalling\", despite some amendments. \"Clearly, President Museveni should reject the bill and send a clear message that Uganda doesn't stand for this type of intolerance and discrimination,\" she said. British campaigner Peter Tatchell noted that the bill extends the existing penalty of life imprisonment for same-sex intercourse to all other same-sex behaviour, including the mere touching of another person with the intent to have homosexual relations. \"Promoting homosexuality and aiding and abetting others to commit homosexual acts will be punishable by five to seven years jail,\" Tatchell said. \"These new crimes are likely to include membership and funding of LGBT organisations, advocacy of LGBT human rights, supportive counselling of LGBT persons and the provision of condoms or safer sex advice to LGBT people. \"A person in authority \u2013 gay or heterosexual \u2013 who fails to report violators to the police within 24 hours will be sentenced to three years behind bars.\" He added: \"Astonishingly, the new legislation has an extra-territorial jurisdiction. It will also apply to Ugandan citizens or foreign residents of Uganda who commit these 'crimes' while abroad, in countries where such behaviour is not a criminal offence. Violators overseas will be subjected to extradition, trial and punishment in Uganda. \"This bill is in some respects even more draconian than the extreme homophobic laws of countries like Saudi Arabia and Iran.\" Homosexuality is taboo in many African countries, and illegal in 37. Uganda's bill has been condemned by world leaders since it was first mooted four years ago. US president Barack Obama called it \"odious\" and said it is \"unconscionable to target gays and lesbians for who they are\". But it strikes a chord in the socially conservative east African nation, where in 2010 a newspaper published the names and addresses of gay people under the caption \"Hang them\". The following year, gay rights activist David Kato was murdered, although the police denied he was targeted because of his sexuality. Last month, a gay British man was arrested after pictures of him having sex were made public. The vote came a day after Uganda's parliament passed an anti-pornography law that bans miniskirts and anything that \"shows sexual parts of a person such as breasts, thighs, buttocks\", according to the Monitor newspaper. It also outlaws \"any erotic behaviour intended to cause sexual excitement or any indecent act or behaviour tending to corrupt morals\". Dr Kapya Kaoma, a senior religion and sexuality researcher at the US-based think tank Political Research Associates, said: \"The Uganda situation must be seen in context. It is part of a larger trend. The persecution of sexual minorities in other African nations such as Zambia and Zimbabwe has been especially severe in recent months. \"Also, we have to consider that the actions of Russia's Vladmir Putin to criminalise both homosexuality and reproductive freedom in Russia may provide cover as well as courage to human rights violators. \"Of course, in all of these regions, we find the active involvement of American conservatives who, having lost public opinion in the United States, have determined to take their culture war crusades abroad.\"",

When South Koreans heard that the Korean Air executive delayed a flight because she was angry at being served macadamia nuts in a bag there was outrage but no surprise.

Korean Air Lines apologized Tuesday for inconveniencing passengers after the daughter of its chairman ordered a crew member off a flight for serving bagged nuts in the first class cabin. A Korean Air logo is seen at its ticketing counter at Gimpo Airport... Nut rage spat latest stumble for Korean Air family SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 When South Koreans heard that a Korean Air Lines executive delayed a flight because she was angry at being served macadamia nuts in a bag there was outrage but no surprise. For many it was only the latest example of the high and mighty behavior they'd come to expect from the families who make up Korea's dynastic business elite and dominate the economy. In the headline hogging incident now dubbed \"nut rage,\" Cho Hyun-ah, the airline's head of cabin service and daughter of its chairman, ordered a senior crew member off the plane, forcing it to return to the gate at John F. Kennedy airport in New York City. Cho had quarreled with flight attendants in first class after one of them offered her bagged nuts instead of nuts served on a plate. Amid the storm of criticism, Cho resigned Tuesday as head of cabin service but remained an executive at the airline. That sparked another furor and Cho on Wednesday submitted a letter of resignation quitting all her roles. Korean Air had defended her actions as a \"natural\" attempt to improve customer service. Yet for a public that has lost patience with impunity and double standards, it was an ugly display of entitlement. The local media labeled her \"princess.\" The Cho family has a history of making headlines in South Korea. Cho, 40, who is also known as Heather Cho, is married to a prominent plastic surgeon who performed his nips and tucks in Gangnam, a tony district of Seoul famous for its plastic surgery clinics and hip shops. In 2013, she gave birth to twin boys in Hawaii, entitling them to U.S. citizenship. Korean Air had sent Cho to work in the U.S. two months before her expected delivery date. But within South Korea there was anger that U.S. citizenship meant her sons would be able to avoid South Korea's two years of compulsory military service for able-bodied males. Cho's brother, Won-tae, 38, was investigated by police in 2005 for pushing an elderly woman who confronted him about his reckless driving, the Yonhap news agency reported. The family patriarch, Cho Yang-ho, 65, was convicted of tax evasion in 2000, facing charges with his father and brother. The Chos were charged with receiving millions in rebates when they purchased airplanes from Boeing and Airbus and evading taxes on the money. The nut rage incident, however, struck a particular chord as it comes at a time when growing inequality and safety issues are on the minds of South Koreans. There are also growing calls to better treat service industry workers. On an online forum used by Korean Air pilots, there was an outpouring of complaints about the behavior of the Cho family in their running of the airline. In South Korea, there was once respect for the families that founded the industrial conglomerates that helped modernize the country and make it wealthy. Nowadays there is growing criticism of ostentatious wealth and unfettered power. The criticism is particularly directed at the newest generation, which is inheriting the business empires founded by their fathers and grandfathers. Cho and her two siblings rose quickly to the top ranks of the airline, holding executive roles in it and affiliate companies. The Cho family, through its Hanjin conglomerate, has controlled Korean Air Lines since 1969 when it bought the monopoly state airline from the government. It is now a major Asian carrier, but its early years were dogged by multiple plane crashes. Korean Air was also infamous for low wages and demanding schedules for pilots. The family's direct stake in Korean Air is just 10 percent but cross-shareholdings among Hanjin companies give it effective control.",

        "article": "The Iranian \"threat\" which has been promoted by the \"neocon\" US foreign policy mavens, with the knee-padded, yellow livered, Neville Chamberlain styled US corporate media in tow, alongside all those others who benefit from war \u2013 is another version of the \"threat\" posed by Iraq's (nonexistent) weapons of mass destruction. In other words, it is yet another baseless, paranoid conspiracy theory, manufactured by professional manipulators and myth makers, and designed to terrorize the US public and bring them into line via a new round of fear-mongering in keeping with the climate that was established in the immediate wake of 9/11. This fear strategy is a time-tested psychological weapon to subjugate and silence the people, employed by rogue governments throughout history. Regardless of whether Iran is pursuing nuclear weapons, a nuclear power program or a combination of the two, it is illogical (without looking below the surface) that the United States should prioritize Iran as an enemy, especially since Iran has not attacked anyone \u2013 not even their neighbors \u2013 in over 250 years \u2013 and shows no intent of doing so in the future. However, a quick look at why this issue should be of such interest to the US \u2013 10,000 miles away on the other side of the world \u2013 reveals that US mid-east policy (alongside many other areas of government policy) is totally under the control of Israel. In both the previous (Bush) and current (Obama) administrations, a very large proportion of senior officials are known to be dual Israeli-US citizens. Obviously, Iran has long been considered an enemy to Israel, but only in recent years has the US taken such a close interest.... i.e. from the time that many of these dual Israeli-IS citizens were installed in senior positions in the 2001 Bush administration. This leads to an obvious and very blatant conflict of interest issue: Should dual citizens of a foreign nation \u2013 to which a subject has declared allegiance \u2013 be permitted to take positions of authority in our nation? Imagine the outcry if it was discovered that just *one* senior government official was a citizen of, Japan, for example, or Germany, or Brazil.... or, God forbid, Venezuela or Communist China?! But as regards Israel, nobody even raises an eyebrow, probably in fear of being \"ad hominemed\" as \"anti-Semitic\", a Jew hater, or even a \"holocaust denier\". These are powerful and persuasive factors that ensure the people's individual and collective silence and complicity. Since the demise of the Soviet empire by 1992, the US military-industrial sector suddenly required a new boogeyman to replace the much ballyhooed \"Communist threat\". It had no choice \u2013 the tentacles of the defense/security/intelligence sector had so metastasized within the core of the US economy since the 1950s and the height of the Cold War, that a scaling back (of the military-industrial complex) to a size in keeping with the perceived threat, would have reduced defense and related spending by a huge factor, and thus caused a correspondingly massive recession in the heavily subsidized militarized section of the US economy, already inflated to a disproportionate extent. In other words, this was never a practical option for \"instant\" transformation away from a heavily militarized economy. During the Clinton years, that administration, however, did start to make gradual cuts in military spending; this utterly enraged a certain group of neoconservative hawks in DC, many being the same set of uber-hawkish dual US Israeli citizens who were appointed in droves to the 2001 Bush White House. In response to Clinton's cuts, they wrote their landmark essay \"Rebuilding America's Defenses\". It's original form was so outlandish that it was \"moderated\" to gain the wider appeal of the mainstream \u2013 but it still remained an utterly paranoid, extremist document in which the agenda called for not only only a massive increase of defense etc spending, but also the ability to wage simultaneous wars in multiple theaters, install space-based weaponry, engage in \"full spectrum dominance\", and even develop biological weapons that targeted \"specific ethnic genotypes\" \u2013 in other words people of Middle eastern non-Jewish heritage \u2013 a Eugenics lookalike, except with the aim of targeting \"undesirable\" racial types \u2013 obviously Arabs and Muslims... in foreign lands. The document also stated that \"to gain public and Congressional acceptance, the process of transformation would likely be a long and gradual one, absent a catalyzing catastrophic incident, like a New Pearl Harbor\". Significantly, this mega-racist message of intentional global thuggery was released on September 10, 2000. Iran was one of the many nations in the crosshairs of hatred. Exactly *one year* later, September 10, 2001, Donald Rumsfeld, then defense secretary, stood up in the US Senate and announced that $2.3 TRILLION had \"gone missing\" from the Pentagon \u2013 the largest instance of mass fraud and theft in global history. The task of investigating this massive disappearance of the nation's money was being undertaken by accountants attached to the US Navy budget analysts offices, which were headquartered in a recently refurbished section of the Pentagon. The following day, September 11, 2001 \u2013 we all know what happened. The case of the missing $2.3 Trillion was quickly and conveniently abandoned and never questioned again. Those who were investigating the mega-fraud were killed when AA Flight 77 plowed into their offices, destroying all the record and the backups. The 19 alleged \"fundamentalist Muslim\" hijackers gave the neocons, the Israeli hardliners and the US war machine the greatest windfall they could have ever hoped for in their wildest wet dreams. Right after the Twin Towers came down, Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu said, in an unguarded moment \u2013 probably brought on by glee and excitement \u2013 that \"this (attack) is very good news for Israel\".... before awkwardly backtracking and rephrasing his comment. This was 10.5 years ago. Since then we have spent over $3 Trillion in the so-called \"war on terrorism\", killed perhaps as many as 2 million innocents, destroyed portions of our own Constitution and Bill of Rights, signed acts into law that are more suited to a police state than a \"free republic\", trashed our economy, and more is on the way. The Obama Administration has pursued an identical policy set to its predecessors.... if anything, they have ramped up the agenda of hatred by expanding the war in Afghanistan, spilling over into Pakistan, and now they plan on attacking Iran. Or, should I rephrase that: the Israeli Likudist hardliners, who have the Obama Administration wrapped around their pinkies, have strong-armed the US into going full on with the Israeli agenda. Unfortunately, the corporate media is populated by \"analysts\" like the author of this article, who appear to be interested in furthering the same agenda, while scaring and dumbing down the American people into meek obeisance.",

        "article": "Hundreds of people marched through Berkeley for a third night a row, blocking a major highway and stopping a train as activists in this ultra-liberal bastion protest grand jury decisions not to indict white police officers in the deaths of two unarmed black men. Protesters blocked traffic on both sides of Interstate 80 in Berkeley, while another group stood on and sat on train tracks, forcing an Amtrak train to stop on Monday night. The California Highway Patrol said a large group of demonstrators destroyed highway perimeter fencing, flooded lanes and threw rocks and other objects at officers. It took about an hour and a half to clear the interstate, and no major injuries were reported. The agency arrested 150 people on suspicion of resisting arrest, obstructing police and other charges. The Berkeley Police Department arrested an additional nine people, including a juvenile, Officer Jennifer Coats said early Tuesday. She described the latest protests as mostly peaceful, with no injuries and no reports of looting or damaged property. Police estimated the crowd at about 1,500 people. The first stop for demonstrators shouting, \u201cWho do you protect? Peaceful protest\u201d was the Berkeley police department. A line of officers in riot gear blocked them from getting close to the building. The group then headed to a Bay Area Rapid Transit train station and sat outside, prompting authorities to briefly shut down the station. But as the night went on, the protesters divided into smaller groups that disrupted traffic and train passengers. The California Highway Patrol said in a tweet that some in the crowd tore down fencing to enter the freeway. Merchants in downtown Berkeley on Monday cleaned up broken glass and took stock of the previous night\u2019s looting after a protest turned that turned violent on Sunday night. Although many activists in other parts of the country have gone home, protests in Berkeley and Oakland are still active, reflecting the area\u2019s long history of protest dating to the 1960s. The crowds that came out to protest in Berkeley numbered only a few hundred, but some are not college students or residents so much as full-time demonstrators who protest anything \u2013 war, prison conditions and economic inequality \u2013 and sometimes use demonstrations as a pretext for violence and vandalism, just as they did during the Occupy Wall Street movement. Berkeley mayor Tom Bates said a tiny fraction of protesters are obscuring the wider message calling for reform of policing policies nationwide. \u201cThe people in the Bay Area are sensitive to worldwide issues,\u201d Bates said. \u201cUnfortunately, there is a small element that uses violence at times to make their point.\u201d Bates called the violent elements of the demonstration \u201ccowards and thugs who need to take off their masks.\u201d It was not immediately known if protesters were arrested on Monday night. Five people were arrested on Sunday, police said. Stuart Geiger, 27, a University of California, Berkeley, doctoral student, attended the protest and recorded video of peaceful demonstrators attempting to stop the looting of a Radioshack. \u201cThere was a pretty vocal sentiment there about keep this a peaceful protest and stay on message,\u201d Geiger said. Another peaceful protester was struck by a hammer and slightly injured when he tried to stop looting. In keeping with the city\u2019s protest history, Berkeley leaders have put limits on their police. Officers cannot have search dogs, stun guns or helicopters and are restricted in the type of gear they can wear, said Berkeley police union president Sgt Chris Stines. \u201cAll of us are out there wearing what we wear on patrol, and as a result, we are getting pretty banged up,\u201d he said, explaining that shin and chest guards and padded vests would help prevent injuries. At least three officers suffered minor injuries. The protests started after a 24 November decision by the grand jury not to indict officer Darren Wilson in the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. A New York grand jury on 3 December declined to prosecute a police officer captured on video applying a fatal chokehold on Eric Garner. That decision set off another series of demonstrations nationwide. Oakland police have arrested about 200 people since the protests started.",

        "article": "Israel's military deployed hundreds of troops Wednesday to help police trying to stop a wave of deadly Palestinian shooting and stabbing attacks that have triggered panic across the country. Police also say they foiled an attack outside Jerusalem's Old City, shooting and killing the assailant as he attempted to stab security forces. Eight Israelis and 30 Palestinians-- including 13 identified by Israel as attackers -- have died in a month of unrest, with dozens of other people wounded. The government has thus far been unable to stop the violence. Israel says the attacks have been fueled by what it calls rampant incitement against Jews and Israelis on social media spread by Islamic groups and the Palestinian leadership. Israeli police said 300 soldiers had already been incorporated into their deployment on the streets of east Jerusalem, where many of the assailants are from. \"It's all about horrible, anti-Jewish, racist incitement.\" - Israeli Cabinet minister Yuval Steinitz Israeli Cabinet minister Yuval Steinitz said the current conflict had less to do with political differences and more with anti-Semitic incitement to create a religious war. Speaking to journalists, he showed Palestinian videos and animations that glorified the stabbings of Jews in the Old City of Jerusalem and the killing of a Jewish settler couple in the West Bank in front of their children. He also quoted Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' recent statement where he blessed \"every drop of blood spilled for Allah\" and that Jews desecrated a Jerusalem holy site with their \"filthy feet.\" \"This is not new. It is just a new wave of terrorism and violence and this time it's totally clear that the main approach here is a religious approach. Defending Islam from the enemy of the mosque, the enemy of Islam -- against the Jews,\" Steinitz said. \"It's all about horrible, anti-Jewish, racist incitement.\" The cabinet met late into the night and released details of the new measures early Wednesday morning. Steps approved include allowing police to impose a closure on points of friction or incitement according to security assessments. The Cabinet also decided to strip residency rights and demolish homes of some attackers and draft hundreds more security guards to secure public transport. The announcement came after a particularly bloody day in which a pair of Palestinian stabbing and shooting attacks in Jerusalem killed three Israelis. Three Palestinians, including two attackers, were also killed. The wave of violence also comes at a time when prospects for negotiating an end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict seem nonexistent. Meantime, during a protest in the West Bank city of Bethlehem, masked Palestinians hurled stones at forces who responded with tear gas and stun grenades. Also Wednesday, Israel's internal security minister said the bodies of dead Palestinian attackers should not be returned to their families for burial. Gilad Erdan said the funeral processions of Palestinians who killed Israelis often turn into \"an exhibition of support for terror and incitement to murder.\" He said Israel should not allow them to \"enjoy respect and ceremonies\" after their deaths. The funerals are a frequent flashpoint for clashes and often include calls for revenge. Erdan suggested the attackers be buried without fanfare in distant cemeteries where previous Palestinian killers have been buried. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

        "article": "With nothing to lose, an Indiana woman posted a picture of herself on Facebook holding up a handwritten sign with an impassioned plea: \u201cI\u2019m looking for my birth mother ... Please share & help me out!\u201d After 22 years of wondering who that woman is, it took just 12 hours for Whitney Brock to get her answer. The stunning revelation was one she had desperately waited for \u2014 and never gave up on even when others told her it was a foolhardy endeavor. \u201cPeople said, \u2018If you do find her, you have to keep in mind that it might not be what you\u2019re looking for. You might be disappointed,\u201d Brock told the Daily News on Tuesday. \u201cBut growing up, I always had this fairy tale ending for when I\u2019d finally meet my biological family. I needed to see this through.\u201d Brock posted the picture Aug. 28. On the sign she mentions where she was born \u2014 a hospital in Evansville, on the border of northwestern Kentucky \u2014 and the name of her birth mother, Jennifer Moorhead. She said it took her a while to work up the courage to locate Moorhead \u2014 not knowing whether the woman was even alive, or whether she would immediately shun her. Besides, Brock already had supportive parents who had taken her in when she was a newborn and loved her unconditionally. When Brock was old enough to understand, they told her she was adopted. But the young woman was consumed with a nagging question: Who is my biological mother? \u201cI\u2019ve had people say, \u2018Why do you even want to find her? She didn\u2019t want anything to do with you,\u2019\u201d Brock said. \u201cIt might sound silly, but I always felt she loved me.\u201d When Brock was 18, she tried to obtain government records identifying her birth mother, but state law requires the adoptee to be at least 21. Undeterred, Brock \u2014 through her own legwork \u2014 obtained a piece of paper with her biological name on it and discovered her mother\u2019s identity. Still, she wasn\u2019t sure where to turn. She remembered seeing other children in similar situations reaching out through social media. RELATED: ORPHANED RUSSIAN ABANDONED BY ADOPTIVE PARENTS So she gave Facebook a shot. \u201cI got maybe 30 \u2018likes\u2019 on it,\u201d said Brock, who felt anxious. \u201cI had tried not to get my hopes up too much. I kept refreshing the page, and I remember one of my friends saying it\u2019s not like you\u2019re going to wake up and know who your mom is.\u201d The next morning, Brock checked her inbox and received a message from a woman in Florida, someone she didn\u2019t know. The woman gave her a list of five possible Jennifer Moorheads and phone numbers. A bold Brock, wasting no time, tried the first one in Indiana. A woman picked up. \u201cI asked if she had put a baby up for adoption in 1991,\u201d Brock said. \u201cThen she asked me, \u2018Feb. 6?\u2019 And I said yes.\u201d Next came the confirmation: \u201cShe said, \u2018Is this Whitney Brock?\u2019 When I said yes, she told me, \u2018I\u2019m your mother,\u2019\u201d Brock remembered. It turned out that the Facebook post was shared by the right people: A friend of Moorhead\u2019s sister saw it and forwarded the picture to Moorhead, who was already anticipating Brock\u2019s call. Moorhead, who lives in Gary, about five hours away from Brock, was not only happy to hear from her biological daughter \u2014 she wanted to meet. \u201cIt\u2019s like winning the lottery. Better than winning the lottery,\u201d Moorhead later told NBC affiliate WFIE. Brock and Moorhead had a reunion at an Evansville restaurant earlier this month. Brock\u2019s mom, Teresa Brock, came along, as did Brock\u2019s 3-year-old daughter, Rylan. Brock learned that Moorhead was a single mom in 1991 and already had a son when she found out that she was pregnant with a daughter. RELATED: PARENTS SWAP ADOPTED KIDS ONLINE Financially, she couldn\u2019t take care of another child, and made the heart-wrenching decision to give Brock up for adoption, she said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t know that I went to the most-deserving family ever,\u201d Brock said. \u201cThey weren\u2019t able to have kids themselves. That\u2019s when they found me.\u201d Moorhead, meanwhile, decided not to contact Brock because she didn\u2019t want to intrude on her life. But she never forgot about the baby whom she held for a fleeting moment. \u201cShe always wondered where I was, but she thought it\u2019d be best if I was the one who looked for her,\u201d Brock said. Finding her birth mother was also significant, Brock added, because of her own health issues. Brock said she\u2019s been suffering from a dropping heart rate, and when she goes to the hospital, the doctors inquire about her family\u2019s medical history. She could never tell them \u2014 until now. The day after talking with Moorhead, Brock went to see a specialist who happened to ask about her family. \u201cIt was the first time I could actually put down family history. I know to a lot of people it wouldn\u2019t seem like much, but after 22 and a half years, I could never do that.\u201d Brock \u2014 for everything she\u2019s been through \u2014 now has the peace of mind she was searching for. But she warns other adoptees that their fantasies won\u2019t always live up to the reality. \u201cI would definitely tell them to pursue it and try to find their families, but they have to keep in mind, this is very rare,\u201d Brock said. \u201cNever in a million years did I think that this would have a perfect ending.\u201d On a mobile device?

        "article": "Chip Kelly is the offensive-minded, experienced head coach the San Francisco 49ers have long sought, and now he needs to win \u2014 right away. The 49ers hired the former Eagles coach on Thursday, finding the leader CEO Jed York is counting on to turn things around for his once-proud franchise. Kelly faces the daunting challenge of transforming the Niners into an immediate contender again. \"We are thrilled to announce Chip Kelly as the new head coach of the San Francisco 49ers,\" York said in a statement. \"Chip has a proven track record at both the college and NFL levels that speaks for itself. We believe strongly that he is the right man to get this team back to competing for championships. I look forward to watching Trent (Baalke) and Chip work closely to build a team that will make us all proud.\" Kelly, who had personnel control with the Eagles and frustrated some of his players, won't be introduced in a news conference until next week at Levi's Stadium based on scheduling conflicts and Kelly working to immediately build his staff. \"As one of the most historic franchises in the National Football League, I realize the high standards and expectations that this position demands and I embrace the challenges ahead,\" Kelly said in a statement. \"My immediate focus is to build the best coaching staff possible, one that will maximize the abilities of each of our players and put us in the best position to win football games.\" Kelly replaces fired coach Jim Tomsula, promoted from his defensive line duties last January to succeed Jim Harbaugh before going 5-11 \u2014 a move Baalke has said earlier this month wound up to be the wrong one, in hindsight. With his 26 years of coaching experience, Kelly emerged as the favorite among several candidates, including former Raiders, Broncos and Redskins coach Mike Shanahan, ex-Giants coach Tom Coughlin and former Raiders coach Hue Jackson, who was hired Wednesday to coach the Cleveland Browns. The 52-year-old Kelly was fired by Philadelphia after Week 16 with one game left in his third season as coach. The former University of Oregon coach was 6-9 in 2015 following two 10-6 seasons, prompting Eagles CEO Jeffrey Lurie to make a change. The 49ers jumped right into the mix last week to talk to him. \"Chip possesses all the qualities we were looking for in our next head coach,\" Baalke said. \"He has demonstrated the ability to be innovative everywhere he has coached and has had great success throughout his career. \"Chip's passion for the game and vision for the future of this team clearly stood out to us during the search process. He is an extremely driven individual that I look forward to working with.\" Kelly becomes just the second coach the franchise has ever hired with previous regular NFL head coaching experience along with Dennis Erickson ahead of the 2003 season \u2014 excluding Tomsula's single game as interim coach to end the 2010 season after Mike Singletary was fired. Hiring the offensive-minded Kelly could give the 49ers a reason to keep quarterback Colin Kaepernick to work his way back into the dominant, dynamic quarterback he was a few years back with his legs and strong arm. There has been thought that Kaepernick could be the kind of mobile quarterback Kelly likes running his fast-paced offense and a good fit. \"Guess I might have to start running right now to get in shape,\" wide receiver Torrey Smith posted on Twitter shortly after the announcement. San Francisco has missed the playoffs the past two seasons, going 8-8 in 2014 in now-Michigan coach Harbaugh's final season before what the team called a \"mutual decision\" to part ways with one year remaining on his contract. The 49ers reached three straight NFC championship games and a Super Bowl under Harbaugh, losing by three points to his older brother, John, and the Baltimore Ravens in the championship after the 2012 season to miss the franchise's sixth Lombardi Trophy. On Jan. 4, a day after firing Tomsula shortly after the season-finale overtime win against St. Louis, York vowed to bring the 49ers back to prominence. \"Even looking over the last few seasons, I think it's important to learn and to grow from your mistakes. I think I understand what the fans want,\" he said. \"They want a team that they can be proud of on Sundays. They want a championship team. I want that too and I'm fighting for that. You can trust me that we are going to do everything that we can to get this team back where it belongs.\" Deciding on the quarterback will be a major decision for Kelly in the coming months. Former first-round pick Blaine Gabbert took over in November for the benched Kaepernick, who has since undergone shoulder and thumb surgeries. Kaepernick's $11.9 million salary for 2016 becomes fully guaranteed for injury come April 1, and there had been belief the team might try to trade him or release him. After Kelly was fired by Philadelphia, former Eagles linebacker Emmanuel Acho tweeted, \"Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.\" Baalke interviewed Coughlin on Monday on the East Coast and Jackson on Sunday in Cincinnati. Buccaneers offensive coordinator Dirk Koetter also interviewed, last Thursday in Tampa, Florida. The coaching staff under Tomsula hadn't been dismissed, though York said the new coach would make those decisions upon his hiring.",

        "article": "When Silicon Valley entrepreneur Jim Heerwagen decided to invest in an effort to reduce the influence of big money on politics, he considered a push for a constitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme Court\u2019s Citizens United decision. \u201cThen I realized I could be dead or not remember where my car keys were by the time that happened,\u201d he said. Congressional proposals to tighten federal campaign finance rules seemed like long-shots, he concluded: \u201cThey just weren\u2019t going to go anywhere.\u201d So Heerwagen looked to make a stand in the more hospitable political environs of California. After commissioning a poll and hiring political strategists, the former software executive and his team of election law experts are rolling out an unusual measure they hope to get on the ballot in November 2016. Dubbed the Voter\u2019s Right to Know Act, the proposed amendment would enshrine in the state Constitution the right to campaign finance disclosure \u2014 making California the first state to put it on par with the rights to speech and privacy, among other fundamental guarantees. The measure also would require political ads to display their top \u201ctrue donors\u201d and overhaul the state campaign finance disclosure database to make it easier to track special interests. [Big money in politics emerges as a rising issue in 2016 campaign] The goal, Heerwagen said, is \u201cto create tracing mechanisms that would enable people to find out who was behind any message, to uncover the secret money.\u201d The measure, which is being filed with the state attorney general\u2019s office Wednesday, comes as the power of wealthy donors in politics has emerged as a prevalent theme in the 2016 presidential contest. The issue has been taken up by candidates on the left and the right, helping propel the insurgent bids of contenders such as Republican tycoon Donald Trump and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who is running as a Democrat. Democratic former secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton recently rolled out her plan to strengthen campaign finance rules, and former Florida governor Jeb Bush (R) has railed against the power of lobbyists in Washington. For all the rhetoric, however, efforts to overhaul the rickety federal campaign finance system are still largely frozen. Democrats in Congress have been unable to amass sufficient bipartisan support for proposals to require more disclosure or adopt public financing. And a gridlocked Federal Election Commission has taken no action as big-money super PACs work in close conjunction with favored candidates this cycle. So proponents are looking to the states, hoping to notch victories that eventually will alter the national climate. \u201cIf California leads the nation in elevating disclosure to our state constitutional level \u2014 if enough states do that \u2014 we\u2019re hoping to get national attention,\u201d said Gary Winuk, a former chief enforcement officer for the state\u2019s Fair Political Practices Commission. Winuk helped draft the Voter\u2019s Right to Know Act along with longtime election law expert Robert M. Stern, who helped write the state\u2019s seminal 1974 political reform act. Additional legal guidance came from the Campaign Legal Center, a Washington-based advocacy group founded by Republican election lawyer Trevor Potter. [Bold but legal: How campaigns and their super PAC backers work together] California already has a robust set of disclosure rules. But Winuk said he discovered that even they were not sufficient when he led an FPPC investigation of nonprofit groups that were used to hide the identities of donors who pumped $15 million into ballot-initiative campaigns in 2012. \u201cThe money stopped at a nonprofit,\u201d Winuk said. \u201cIt never got back to the true donors.\u201d A wide array of advocacy groups across the political spectrum rely on donors who do not want their identities revealed, so the proposed measure probably would trigger a costly political fight. \u201cI suspect there are a lot of people who would see it as an effort to go well beyond the traditional efforts of disclosure that would threaten people\u2019s right to privacy, and that probably would spark some opposition,\u201d said Bradley Smith, a former FEC commissioner and founder of the Center for Competitive Politics, which supports looser campaign finance restrictions. Smith said the act\u2019s requirement that political ads name their \u201ctop three true funders\u201d is overly broad, calling the measure \u201cjunk disclosure.\u201d Supporters of the measure must collect nearly 600,000 signatures in 180 days to get on the ballot. Heerwagen \u2014 a political independent who declined to say how much money he has put into the effort \u2014 said he expects others in Silicon Valley to contribute to it. He said he was heartened by the results of a June poll he commissioned from the Democratic firm FM3, which found that 69 percent of California voters think the lack of disclosure about political funders is a very or extremely serious problem \u2014 on par with issues such as education and poverty and second only to the state\u2019s drought. [California donor disclosure case exposes how nonprofits play in politics ] Advocates of stricter regulation of money in politics are watching the California effort closely. FEC Chairwoman Ann Ravel, who worked with Winuk at the state FPPC, said that establishing a constitutional right to information about political donors could create a new legal framework to support a host of campaign finance rules. \u201cIt is a really innovative response to the issues that are being faced now in the political system,\u201d she said. The proposal comes as efforts to overhaul campaign finance rules this fall are gaining traction in states such as Maine and Washington. A bipartisan group in South Dakota is pushing a ballot initiative for 2016 that would crack down on coordination between candidates and PACs, among other measures. \u201cWhen you see states like South Dakota possibly coming online for reform, you realize the sands are shifting,\u201d said Nick Penniman, executive director of Issue One, a group working to reduce the influence of wealthy interests in politics. It remains to be seen whether that shift will shake up Washington anytime soon. \u201cThe initiative in California just shows how pervasive this revulsion is in the body politic with the idea that the system is rigged and big money is running the show,\u201d said Rep. John Sarbanes (D-Md.), who sponsored a public financing measure that has been co-sponsored by 153 Democrats and one Republican, Rep. Walter B. Jones (N.C.). \u201cThe natural extension of this movement out in states is to bring it to Washington.\u201d Matea Gold is a national political reporter for The Washington Post, covering money and influence.",

        "article": "Let's revisit cultural appropriation for a minute, because it's looks to be a topic that still confuses people a bit. We all know the difference between borrowing and stealing, yes? When you borrow something, you do so with the intention of returning whatever it is you were lent to its original and rightful owner. When you steal something, you take it and keep it wrongfully for yourself. Marc Jacobs issues apology for saying he \u2018doesn\u2019t see color\u2019 Cultural appropriation is stealing. And . . . not cultural appropriation . . . is . . . not stealing? Is borrowing? It's a global issue, but the most recent, highly publicized example of it in the fashion industry pertains to Marc Jacobs's Spring 2017 show at Hammerstein Ballroom. When criticized for using rainbow-colored dreadlocks \u2014 of which he had credited Lana Wachowski, Boy George, club kids, and others for their inspiration \u2014 on his predominantly white cast of models, he reacted with the following: The short girl's survival guide to New York Fashion Week \"And all who cry \u2018cultural appropriation\u2019 or whatever nonsense about any race of skin color wearing their hair in a particular style or manner \u2014 funny how you don't criticize women of color for straightening their hair. I respect and am inspired by people and how they look. I don't see color or race \u2014 I see people. I'm sorry to read that so many people are so narrow minded . . . Love is the answer. Appreciation of all and inspiration from anywhere is a beautiful thing. Think about it.\" He later apologized for his \"lack of sensitivity unintentionally expressed by (his) brevity.\" And then, last week, the New York Times published an article with the headline, \"How to get Josephine Baker Waves, the Modern Way,\" pairing it with an image of Kendall Jenner and Bella Hadid sporting the classy \u2019do. Listen, I get it. The New York Times is running a business and needs to attract readers. And what does that? Familiar faces. Familiar celebrity faces. Familiar celebrity faces people want to emulate. Glittering garb at NY Fashion Week may spell the end of normcore Between the two of them, Kendall Jenner and Bella Hadid are followed by 74.7 million entities on Instagram ALONE. From a business perspective, it makes sense. To its credit, the Times had the foresight of attributing Josephine Baker for the trend. What's troubling, however, is that it's the author who seemingly makes the connection between the hairstyle used in Givenchy's 2017 show, and Josephine Baker's famed slick; not the designer Riccardo Tisci, or hairstylist Guido Palau (who was also in charge of the Marc Jacobs show). This is where trouble is bred. There can be no legitimate respect for the culture and artistry born from people of color if the same tactic of displaying \"familiar faces\" is used over and over again. It's a cycle that feeds into itself. The argument that there aren't enough well-known celebrities of color is a poor one, and honestly, a cop out. Recognition can't be granted if there isn't a platform for it. Equality is a pretty word to look at, but means nothing if it isn't employed. Glad Instagrammed peach butt season is over? Yeah, me too According to the last census, there are approximately 50 million Hispanic and Latinos, 37 million Black and African Americans, 14 million Asians, 2 million American Indians and Alaskan Natives, and 400,000 Pacific Islanders in the United States. Is it really so difficult to find diverse talent? Even within the article, a picture of the Ethiopian-Irish actress Ruth Negga \u2014 whose performance in the film \u201cLoving\u201d is already generating Oscar buzz \u2014 is shown with the Josephine Baker style. Would she not have worked for the headline? What about Solange, Janelle Mon\u00e1e, or Beyonc\u00e9? They were mentioned also (come to think of it, only black female celebrities were mentioned). Surely someone would recognize Beyonc\u00e9. Of course it's complicated. On the one hand, I get where Marc Jacobs was coming from. I get where Riccardo Tisci and Guido Palau were coming from. Dreadlocks look super cool. Josephine Baker's style effused beauty and elegance. It would be a shame to restrict certain aesthetics to select groups of people. As a woman of Mexican and Spanish descent, I'd be remiss if the rest of the world were not privy to the qualities of my beautiful heritages. Tex-Mex? What a wonderful partnership that is! But it's one thing to borrow aspects from a culture, and quite another to run off with them. Plus, it usually results in disaster. I mean, do y'all remember when Jean-Georges Vongerichten and Ian Coogan came up with that recipe for pea guacamole, and the Times, again, published it as the new \"it\" thing? Why? No one likes peas, they are a weird vegetable. Even President Obama, leader of the free world who is getting gray hairs just trying to keep us all in line, took the time to tweet about it and be like, \"Nah.\" As a Mexican American and native Texan, I still find this abomination very upsetting. It may not seem like a big deal \u2014 after all it's \"just hair,\" or it's \"just food\" \u2014 but after a lifetime of \"just,\" one finds themselves slowly robbed of everything. The whole, \"art belongs to the world and freedom of expression is for everyone,\" line? Yeah, it's true. But it's also a lot easier to use when the world doesn't repeatedly steal your playlist and beats, steal your snacks and booze, steal your fashion and dance moves, and then not invite you to the party. We belong at the party. In fact, we deserve and have every right to be at the party. Unless that pea guac is being served, in which case, thanks but no thanks, I'll kick it at home.

        "article": "Toast lovers, I have a modest proposal for you: Do not bother with bad bread. Say goodbye to sweet, cottony, lightweight toast, the kind that squishes under a butter knife or slumps under a blanket of jam. Just get the good stuff instead, the best bread you\u2019re able to buy, preferably handmade loaves with sturdy crusts and tender crumbs, imbued with the flavors of fermentation. It\u2019s more expensive, and that\u2019s no small thing. But unlike some other items for which you may pay more, good bread is worth a little extra. Then always keep it on hand. I would argue that the best way to store bread isn\u2019t to wrap it in foil, plastic or brown paper bags, sheath it in a pillowcase or stash it in the breadbox. The best way to keep bread is to put it into the freezer \u2014 sliced. The slicing is crucial here. (It\u2019s also a minor heresy, but hear me out.) Home bread bakers know that a whole loaf freezes incredibly well. But when you defrost it, you replicate the problem of a whole loaf fresh out of the oven: Unless you have a full house, it\u2019s a race to finish it before it goes stale. (Yes, you could make bread crumbs, but with apologies to devotees of schnitzel and gratins, who actually needs that many bread crumbs?) There are only two of us at my place, so a big loaf of fresh bread is difficult to take down. By contrast, slices of good bread in the freezer practically qualify as convenience food: single serving and ever ready, the base of a luxuriously simple breakfast, a satisfying lunch, a restorative snack, a relaxed supper. And because you have stored your slices in the freezer, they do not degrade in the quick and nasty style of sliced bread left to languish at room temperature. Here\u2019s what I do: Whenever I see an alluring loaf of bread, I buy it, take it home, then start slicing, cutting about half the loaf into thick, toaster-ready slices. I put the pieces in a plastic zipper bag and pop them into the freezer. (Halved bagels work well, too.) Then any time I want a piece of toast, I take a slice out of the freezer and put it directly into the toaster. Professional bakers may blanch, but I think the results are nearly as good as toasting a slice from a day-old loaf on the counter. You don\u2019t need any particular type of toaster. But you do need to think of your freezer periodically. You don\u2019t want to just abandon bread to time and freezer burn, though I can tell you from experience that neglected slices will still work, even if the toasted texture won\u2019t be nearly as good. Whatever you do, do not drag the microwave into this, no matter how deeply frozen the bread. This is between you, the freezer and the toaster. Bear in mind that the fresher your bread is when it goes in the freezer, the better your results will be. So gauge how much you want to eat fresh, and just freeze the rest. You could even freeze it all at once, a formidable supply of toast in case the craving strikes.

        "article": "J.K. Rowling arrives at the World Premiere of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 in London, on Nov. 11, 2010. By now you\u2019re no doubt aware that Robert Galbraith, the unknown author of a new detective novel called The Cuckoo\u2019s Calling, is actually J.K. Rowling, gazillion-selling Harry Potter creator and epoch-making publishing phenom. Almost as soon as word got out, sales of the novel went from extremely modest (as of last week, it had sold about 500 copies in the US after its April release) to stratospheric (it is now the number-one bestseller at Amazon, the publisher is raising the print run from 10,000 copies to 300,000, first editions are going for $300 on eBay, and a signed first edition got a bid of $3,000). Business Insider states, with some justification, that \u201cevery aspiring author should be depressed\u201d by this story. Rowling\u2019s experiment with pseudonymity constitutes: a truly illuminating example of the fundamental unfairness and absurdity that lies at the heart of the book publishing industry. It\u2019s long been known that the publishing industry works through sheer numbers. Publishers throw everything at the wall and see what sticks, and the mega-hits, of which there are few, pay for the flops, of which there are many. What Rowling\u2019s experiment reveals, however, is that even a great book by an unknown author can simply get lost. As bad as that is, the full picture is probably worse. The Financial Times observes that roughly concurrently with the Rowling/Galbraith publishing earthquake, Radiohead\u2019s Thom Yorke quit the Spotify streaming service in protest that its royalty model puts smaller musicians at a disadvantage. As the producer Nigel Godrich put it, \u201cSmall labels and artists can\u2019t even keep their lights on\u201d from the pittances they receive. The big guys still make all the money, and the little guys have an even worse time than they used to. But hold on a second. Wasn\u2019t the democratization of the digital era supposed to take power away from the behemoths and deliver it to the small artist? Wasn\u2019t it supposed to mark the rebirth of the midlist author, once shunted into obscurity by blockbuster-hungry agents and publishers? Chris Anderson thought so. Seven years ago, he wrote a book, The Long Tail, heralding the dawn of a new era in which the long tail of \u201clesser-selling works of commerce and art could come to rival big hits in profitability, if not sales.\u201d The opposite has happened. Except for the occasional outlier, it\u2019s the existing superstars \u2014 people who are already a brand \u2014 who continue to reap the big profits, with even less room for unknowns to enter. \u201cWe used to operate on the 80-20 rule,\u201d Jonny Geller, joint chief executive of UK literary and talent agency Curtis Brown, told the Financial Times, citing the Pareto principle that 80% of sales came from 20% of contributors. \u201cNow, it\u2019s more like 96 to four.\u201d Judith Levy graduated from Duke with degrees in English and History and holds a master\u2019s in International Relations from Oxford.

        "article": "Maybe you didn\u2019t watch the MLS playoffs on Thursday night \u2013 Maid in Manhattan was on the Oxygen Network, after all, and there was some football match or other going on in Foxborough \u2013 but, like the one-eyed dog who can\u2019t catch his Bonio, you missed a real treat. Portland Timbers played Sporting KC in the last of the first-round MLS playoff games, and it was a real doozy, as they say: records broken, thrills galore \u2013 and one of the feeblest Panenkas you\u2019ll ever see. Related: Sport picture of the day: Portland Timbers show off their slices of log One each after 90 minutes, two all after extra-time, and then the party really started. The Timbers won 7-6 in an exhilarating penalty contest that featured a couple of bullets and some lamentable sidefoots, but you have to watch the spot-kick from Saad Abdul-Salaam, who had the chance to win it for Sporting at 5-5. Jeez Louise, how the did that stay out? Off both posts, and Adam Kwarasey managed to keep out of the way and stop it from bobbling in. Just have a look! In sudden death Kwarasey tucked his penalty home, and his opposite number Jon Kempin left his very much untucked. Portland advance, and Sporting, who were top of the Western Conference heap in those dog days of summer, were made to pay for their late-season slump. Whether Portland are a better side than KC is a moot point, but that\u2019s why we love these wildcard playoffs! (Isn\u2019t it?) The Timbers take on Vancouver in a crunch Cascadia clash that should have the fans in the north-west biting their fingernails. On paper it looks extremely tight: both sides finished with the same number of points in the regular season, and two of their three matches ended all-square. Who wins? You decide! Now it\u2019s all finished, here\u2019s how we look for Sunday\u2019s first leg matches: DC United v New York Red Bulls Montreal Impact v Columbus Crew Funny little octet in some ways, isn\u2019t it? No NYC or Orlando, obviously, but no LA, no Sporting, no New England. And no Toronto, either. Yep, the men from the 6, who this year made their first postseason in history and celebrated by turfing Stephen Harper from office, got crushed 3-0 by Montreal on Thursday in what the Toronto Star described as the Reds\u2019 worst display of the season \u201cNo excuses,\u201d coach Greg Vanney said afterwards. \u201cThat was not a good enough performance, especially in the first half.\u201d Quite so. Toronto\u2019s defence has been mildly shambolic all season \u2013 no team in MLS has conceded more than their 58 regular-season goals \u2013 and they were 3-0 down before 40 minutes had elapsed. So the team with the biggest wage bill in the league, which spent lavishly to bring Michael Bradley and Jose Altidore back home, and to bring Sebastian Giovinco from his home, is kaput. It\u2019s a shame Giovinco won\u2019t be involved in the most important games of the season, but if truth be told, Toronto are a world away from winning the MLS Cup. As Bradley pointed out: \u201cIn a perfect world it can go quickly, smoothly, but that\u2019s not always the case. Unfortunately a lot of the time there\u2019s going to be these steps along the way. You have to keep going.\u201d Montreal, on the other hand, could be a dangerous sleeper. For some reason, the Impact don\u2019t seem to get the hype as some other teams in the East, but they\u2019re a well-balanced team, have now won four straight, and with Piatti and Drogba in form, they\u2019ll fancy beating the Columbus Crew over two legs. (The Crew might jab their fingers in my face and say: listen you, we finished above Montreal, just hammered DC United 5-0, and our top striker\u2019s better than yours. To which I say: all good points! Please don\u2019t hurt me.) That\u2019s a really good tie, actually, Montreal v Columbus, and a better prospect in the East than DC United v Red Bulls. Does anyone believe Red Bulls won\u2019t prevail over two legs? Maybe Ben Olsen, I suppose, but even he, deep down, probably fears the worst. DC United showed some fortitude, grit and cojones to beat New England 2-1 on Wednesday, although they were thankful to some top saves from Bill Hamid to keep his side in business. \u201cThat\u2019s why we have Bill,\u201d Olsen said afterwards. \u201cThat\u2019s what he does for us. Some teams have Giovincos. We\u2019ve got a Bill.\u201d Incidentally, take a look at Juan Agudelo\u2019s opener for the Revs: Elsewhere, Dallas take on Seattle, after the Sounders beat 3-2 in a match in which, as my esteemed colleague Graham Parker put it, \u201cthe Galaxy only have themselves to blame.\u201d Not just on Wednesday, although they might have won on another day against a reasonably ordinary Seattle side, but I just can\u2019t fathom how they were in the wildcard game in the first place. In August, when they hammered New York City 5-1 and could have scored eight, they looked for all the world like the probable Supporters\u2019 Shield champions. Since that game, they managed just one win in eight. How to explain it? Bruce Arena had a bit of a wink-wink towards Messrs Gerrard and Giovani when, after the Sounders loss, he said of his midsummer signings: \u201cI knew it wasn\u2019t perfect the way we went about doing this. It was, at time, a little bit awkward. I don\u2019t think you do anything in the very short term. When you make those investments, it should be over a couple of years, not a couple of months.\u201d Burn! Well done to Seattle, anyway, after a miserable start to the regular season. Sigi Schmid said on Wednesday night: \u201cBasically, we haven\u2019t done anything easy all year, but it\u2019s all about momentum at this time.\u201d Quite so, and if Ozzie Alonso is fit to play with Nelson Haedo Valdez and Clint Dempsey, the Sounders could do give the Texans a hard time. Dallas\u2019s home form has been excellent, the best in MLS, but it\u2019s not as hot in Frisco in November, and Seattle won\u2019t have to face the blast furnace of Toyota Stadium. Dallas have class and talent, though. They\u2019ll make it count.",

        "article": "The next step up is the value leader, the 2.5S with the same engine and a sticker of $20,425. It comes with disc brakes, halogen headlights, a six-speaker stereo, power windows and locks, air-conditioning and six air bags. It even has an \u201cintelligent key\u201d that needs only to be near the car to unlock the doors and enable the starter. But the great majority of Altimas delivered will come with some of the many available options. First on the list is a continuously variable transmission, or C.V.T., the only automatic available on Altimas ($500). Antilock brakes ($300), a rear spoiler ($360), an electrochromic self-dimming rearview mirror ($280) and fog lamps ($310) can also be had \u00e0 la carte. But most options for the 2.5S are delivered in bundles. To get the satellite radio you must buy the premium Bose sound system ($1,200). Opting for a navigation system along with the Bose means buying a rearview camera and a Bluetooth phone system ($3,200). To get leather, you must buy a power driver\u2019s seat, power sunroof, alloy wheels, heated front seats, automatic dual-zone air-conditioning ($3,850). So an Altima 2.5S configured just so can get expensive, fast. The Altima\u2019s other trim lines are built around Nissan\u2019s mainstay VQ35 engine, a 3.5-liter aluminum-block V-6 that also powers the Maxima sedan, Quest minivan, Murano crossover and 350Z sports car along with the Infiniti G35 and M35. The Altima\u2019s version of the engine yields 270 horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque. The Altima 3.5SE, with a power driver\u2019s seat, C.V.T., 17-inch alloy wheels, antilock brakes, fog lights and a better-looking interior than the one in base 4-cylinder cars, costs $25,125. The plusher 3.5SL ($29,015) comes with all the expected goodies: leather, sunroof, automatic climate control, premium sound, xenon headlamps. Those who truly aspire to luxury can spend $2,000 more on a navigation unit, rearview camera and satellite radio (with perhaps the industry\u2019s most maddening satellite radio interface). I drove the 2.5S, 3.5SL and the first-ever Altima Hybrid on the hilly open roads around Santa Barbara, as well as on the mean freeways of Los Angeles, and I was impressed by what a good car Nissan\u2019s midsize sedan has become. Start with the 2.5S, which Nissan expects to constitute more than half of Altima sales. The interior, which in previous incarnations was dulled by acres of economy-grade plastic, is still unlikely to be confused with the cabin of an Audi or a Lexus, but it is now pleasant and airy. The gauges and controls are nicely positioned and the buttons are big. The front seats, built for well-fed Americans, are comfortable, if less supportive than I would have liked on twisty roads. The rear seat, usually an afterthought in midprice sedans, is first-rate. (One glitch has recently surfaced: if the remote keyfob comes in contact with a cellphone, under some circumstances the fob\u2019s coding is wiped out and it becomes useless. Nissan is working on a fix.) The real payoff to the redesign comes in the driving experience. A stiffer body and reworked suspension make the Altima a pleasure on curvy roads. In its class, only the shorter-wheelbase Mazda 6 is more fun to drive. And the new Altima 2.5S is considerably quieter than the old one: the engine barely purrs at cruising speed. In fact, the in-line 4 could be mistaken for a V-6 until you floor the accelerator and the valves begin to clatter. What most distinguishes the Altima, though, is the C.V.T. One way manufacturers have improved the smoothness and efficiency of automatics is by increasing the gear steps (to five, six or seven); the Lexus LS 460 has eight. The C.V.T., in contrast, uses a system of belts to change gear ratios continuously from very low to very high. This is hardly the first such transmission on a passenger car, but it is surely the best. Larry Dominique, vice president for product planning and strategy at Nissan North America, noted that previous C.V.T.\u2019s were smooth but had a rubber-band feel because the engine speed seemed unrelated to throttle pressure. The far more sophisticated programming in Nissan\u2019s new version delivers a more natural experience. Downshifts are almost instantaneous yet perfectly smooth, and Mr. Dominque says mileage is as much as 10 percent higher. Indeed, this C.V.T. is so clever that in auto-manual mode it simulates six discrete gears quite well, giving hands-on drivers intuitive, responsive control. With an extra 95 horsepower and 78 pound-feet of torque available, the Altima 3.5SE is more powerful and even quieter than the 2.5S, as well as more luxurious. According to Car and Driver magazine, the Altima accelerates from 0 to 60 in just 5.9 seconds with a manual transmission \u2014 quite zippy for a car in this class. From my own experience passing trucks on hilly roads, I can testify that the C.V.T. delivers torque when you need it. The modest downside to all that power is a bit of torque steer \u2014 a distressing, though generally harmless, tendency of powerful front-drive cars to hop in your hands at full throttle. The bigger engine also adds almost 200 pounds to the weight, which slightly degrades cornering. Not surprisingly, more power also means lower mileage: I managed about 23 m.p.g. in mixed city-highway driving, about 3 m.p.g. less than with the Altima 2.5S. The Altima may lack the reputation for bulletproof reliability of the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord. It may not handle quite as well as the Mazda 6 and it is certainly more expensive than comparably equipped Hyundai Sonatas, Saturn Auras or Ford Fusions. But the C.V.T. and the muscular V-6 make the Altima a bit more exciting and versatile than the competition \u2014 at least until an all-new Accord comes out this summer. And, for my money, the Altima\u2019s snazzy new shape gives it an edge in styling. Nissan, it seems, has gone back to the old well and found a new supply of driving elixir.",

        "article": "It's been a week since Pok\u00e9mon Go launched and people still can't stop playing it. Two men even fell off a cliff because they were too focused on catching Pok\u00e9mon and not watching where they were going. The game is so addictive people are literally losing sleep over it because they gotta catch 'em all. Whether you like or hate the game, one thing is for sure: It sucks battery life like there's no tomorrow, leaving little power for you to Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook and do all the other important things that are key to surviving in today's modern world. Like obsessively knowing what Kanye, B\u00e9yonce or Kim Kardashian are doing at all times. Oh the horror if some celebrity released their own emoji app and you missed out because you were busy trying to catch the millionth Zubat. Not to worry, we've rounded up the best ways to save battery life and still be able to enjoy hours of Pok\u00e9mon Go. While it's really cool to be able to see Pok\u00e9mon superimposed on top of the real world, the game's use of augmented reality, which activates your phone's camera, does suck up battery life. Turn off the AR to save some power. The real world will be replaced with a blander background, but the battery benefit is worth it. Plus, Pok\u00e9mon are easier to catch with AR off since they stay still in the center instead of requiring you to aim your phone in the air all over the place. You can turn off AR by hitting the AR switch in the upper right corner of the screen when you encounter a Pok\u00e9mon. Pok\u00e9mon Go has a built-in battery saver. To turn it on tap the Pok\u00e9 Ball, then tap the settings icon (gear in the upper right) and then make sure \"Battery Saver\" is checked. With battery saver turned on, the game will turn black when your phone is held upside down (perfect for when you're walking around outside with your phone by your side) and vibrate when something new happens. In addition to turning on the game's battery saver mode, you can also turn on your phone's battery saver mode as well to squeeze out even more play time. On iPhone go to Settings > Battery > Low Power Mode. On Android go to Settings > Battery > Tap on the three vertical dot icon in the upper right corner > Battery saver > On. While the phone's built-in battery saver is a good way to save power, you should also know that it limits location services (Pok\u00e9mon Go uses your phone's built-in GPS to track your location) and you may see fewer Pok\u00e9Stops and encounter fewer Pok\u00e9mon. This one is a no-brainer and good for saving battery life in general, not only for playing Pok\u00e9mon Go. The only downside is turning down the brightness may make it harder to see what's happening on the screen, especially if you're playing outside in direct sunlight. To adjust the brightness, on iPhone you can pull up the Control Center by swiping up from the bottom of the screen and sliding the brightness slider left or go to Settings > Display & Brightness and adjusting the slider from there. On Android, you can pull down the Quick Settings by swiping down from the top menu bar with two fingers and then adjusting the brightness slider from there. Or go to Settings > Display > Brightness level and adjusting from the there. Just want to catch Pok\u00e9mon and don't care for everything else? You can conserve power by going into the game's settings and turning off all the music, sound effects and vibration. Every one of those things eats up a little bit of battery life that adds up over the course of a play session. To turn them off, tap the Pok\u00e9 Ball, tap Settings (upper right) and then uncheck Music, Sound Effects and Vibration. If you've done all of the above and still need more battery to keep playing Pok\u00e9mon Go, then you need to get checked out because you have an addiction my friend. Have you slept? Have you eaten? Have you taken a break from catching the 'mons? The easiest way to get more battery life it to pick up a battery case or battery pack. Yeah, it's another thing to connect to your phone, but whatevs. More Pok\u00e9mon playtime man. Have something to add to this story? Share it in the comments.",

        "article": "PASADENA, Md. \u2014 Mucking around with sand and water. Playing Candy Land or Chutes and Ladders. Cooking pretend meals in a child-size kitchen. Dancing on the rug, building with blocks and painting on easels. Concerned that kindergarten has become overly academic in recent years, this suburban school district south of Baltimore is introducing a new curriculum in the fall for 5-year-olds. Chief among its features is a most old-fashioned concept: play. \u201cI feel like we have been driving the car in the wrong direction for a long time,\u201d said Carolyn Pillow, who has taught kindergarten for 15 years and attended a training session here on the new curriculum last month. \u201cWe can\u2019t forget about the basics of what these kids need, which is movement and opportunities to play and explore.\u201d As American classrooms have focused on raising test scores in math and reading, an outgrowth of the federal No Child Left Behind law and interpretations of the new Common Core standards, even the youngest students have been affected, with more formal lessons and less time in sandboxes. But these days, states from Vermont to Minnesota to Washington are again embracing play as a bedrock of kindergarten. Like Anne Arundel County here, Washington and Minnesota are beginning to train teachers around the state on the importance of so-called purposeful play \u2014 when teachers subtly guide children to learning goals through games, art and general fun. Vermont is rolling out new recommendations for kindergarten through third grade that underscore the importance of play. And North Carolina is encouraging teachers to evaluate paintings, scribbles or block-building sessions, instead of giving quizzes, in assessing the reading, math and social skills of kindergartners. But educators in low-income districts say a balance is critical. They warn that unlike students from affluent families, poorer children may not learn the basics of reading and math at home and may fall behind if play dominates so much that academics wither. \u201cMiddle-class parents are doing this anyway, so if we don\u2019t do it for kids who are not getting it at home, then they are going to start at an even greater disadvantage,\u201d said Deborah Stipek, dean of the Graduate School of Education at Stanford. Across the country, many schools in recent years have curtailed physical and art education in favor of longer blocks for reading and math instruction to help improve test scores. The harder work even began in kindergarten. Most recently, more than 40 states have adopted the Common Core, standards for reading and math that in many cases are much more difficult than previous guidelines. In some school districts, 5-year-olds are doing what first or even second graders once did, and former kindergarten staples like dramatic play areas and water or sand tables have vanished from some classrooms, while worksheets and textbooks have appeared. A study comparing federal government surveys of kindergarten teachers in 1998 and 2010 by researchers at the University of Virginia found that the proportion of teachers who said their students had daily art and music dropped drastically. Those who reported teaching spelling, the writing of complete sentences and basic math equations every day jumped. The changes took place in classrooms with students of all demographic backgrounds, but the study found that schools with higher proportions of low-income students, as well as schools with large concentrations of nonwhite children, were even more likely to cut back on play, art and music while increasing the use of textbooks. Experts, though, never really supported the expulsion of playtime. Using play to develop academic knowledge \u2014 as well as social skills \u2014 in young children is the backbone of alternative educational philosophies like those of Maria Montessori or Reggio Emilia. And many veteran kindergarten teachers, as well as most academic researchers, say they have long known that children learn best when they are allowed ample time to go shopping at a pretend grocery store or figure out how to build bridges with wooden blocks. Even the Common Core standards state that play is a \u201cvaluable activity.\u201d But educators point out that children are also capable of absorbing sophisticated academic concepts. \u201cPeople think if you do one thing you can\u2019t do the other,\u201d said Nell Duke, a professor of education at the University of Michigan. \u201cIt really is a false dichotomy.\u201d M.Manuela Fonseca, the early-education coordinator for Vermont, said her state was trying to emphasize the learning value of play in its new guidelines. \u201cBefore we had the water table because it was fun and kids liked it,\u201d she said. \u201cNow we have the water table so kids can explore how water moves and actually explore scientific ideas.\u201d Still, teachers like Therese Iwancio, who works at Cecil Elementary School in Baltimore\u2019s Greenmount neighborhood, where the vast majority of children come from low-income families, say their students benefit from explicit academic instruction. She does not have a sand table, play kitchen or easel in the room. \u201cI have never had a child say to me, \u2018I just want to play,\u2019\u201d said Ms. Iwancio, who has taught for two decades. On a recent morning, she asked children to read aloud from a simple book. On the wall hung a schedule for the day, with virtually every minute packed with goals like \u201cI will learn sight words\u201d or \u201cI will learn to compose and decompose teen numbers.\u201d Jayla Stephens, 6, said she liked school because \u201cyou get to do a lot of work and you will get better.\u201d In neighboring, more affluent Anne Arundel County, 321 kindergarten teachers last month attended training sessions on the new curriculum. Required each day: 25 minutes of recess, 20 minutes of movement, 25 minutes in play centers. The district is buying sand or water tables, blocks, play kitchens, easels and art supplies for every classroom that does not have them. Teachers were given tips on how to be more creative in academic lessons, too, like tossing a ball printed with different numbers to teach math. \u201cWe don\u2019t think that rigor negates fun and play,\u201d said Patricia J. Saynuk, coordinator of early-childhood education. Traci Burns, who has taught kindergarten for the last five years at Annapolis Elementary School, said she was looking forward to retrieving previously banished easels. \u201cWith the Common Core, this has been pushed and pushed and pushed that kids should be reading, sitting and listening,\u201d she said. \u201cFive-year-olds need to play and color. They need to go out and sing songs.\u201d At Hilltop Elementary, a racially and economically diverse school in Glen Burnie, Melissa Maenner said she had found that teaching kindergartners too many straightforward academic lessons tended to flop. \u201cThey are 5,\u201d Ms. Maenner said. \u201cTheir attention span is about five minutes.\u201d",

        "article": "JERUSALEM \u2014 President Obama\u2019s endorsement on Thursday of using the 1967 boundaries as the baseline for a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian dispute \u2014 the first by an American president \u2014 prompted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel to push back testily and the Palestinian leadership to call an urgent meeting. Mr. Netanyahu said in a pointed statement just before boarding a plane to Washington that while he appreciated Mr. Obama\u2019s commitment to peace, he \u201cexpects to hear a reaffirmation from President Obama of American commitments made to Israel in 2004 which were overwhelmingly supported by both Houses of Congress.\u201d Those commitments came in a letter from President George W. Bush which stated, among other things that \u201cit is unrealistic to expect that the outcome of final status negotiations will be a full and complete return to the armistice lines of 1949,\u201d another way of describing the 1967 boundaries. Mr. Netanyahu, who is to meet with Mr. Obama at the White House on Friday in what seems likely now to be a tense encounter, added that the commitments \u201crelate to Israel not having to withdraw to the 1967 lines, which are both indefensible and which would leave major Israeli population centers in Judea and Samaria beyond those lines,\u201d a reference to large Israeli settlement blocs in the West Bank. Mr. Netanyahu said in Parliament on Monday that Israel needed to hold on to the large settlement blocs in any two-state solution with the Palestinians. Mr. Obama\u2019s new position does not appear to rule out Israel\u2019s retaining settlements. But it suggests that the United States would back the Palestinian position that a solution should be close to the 1967 lines and that any retained land would be compensated with other land, which is one reason Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s government firmly opposes the change in position. Dore Gold, a former Israeli ambassador to the United Nations and a confidant of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s, lamented by telephone that Mr. Obama\u2019s speech was \u201ca radical shift in United States policy towards Israel.\u201d He said the 2004 letter was endorsed not only by a strong bipartisan majority but by Hillary Rodham Clinton, then a New York senator. \u201cBy mentioning the 1967 lines today, President Obama is going back on what had been an American commitment less than a decade ago,\u201d he added. In the West Bank city of Ramallah, Saeb Erekat, the chief Palestinian negotiator, issued a general statement of appreciation for \u201cefforts being exerted by President Obama with the objective of resuming the permanent status talks in the hope of reaching a final status agreement on all core issues, including Jerusalem and refugees and within a specified time frame.\u201d He added that President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority \u201cdecided to convene an emergency session for the Palestinian leadership as soon as possible and he will consult with our Arab brothers at the same time.\u201d He and other officials declined further comment. Khalil Shikaki, a Palestinian political scientist and pollster, said the Obama speech had created a new situation because it was the first time that a president had declared it to be American policy for the 1967 lines to be the basis for a solution. \u201cThis is much tougher for Israel to swallow, and definitely this is a point which Netanyahu, if he didn\u2019t intend to address in his trip, is now being forced to do so,\u201d Mr. Shikaki said. \u201cAnd if he doesn\u2019t, he will find himself further isolated.\u201d Yossi Beilin, a longtime peace negotiator for Israel and a former government minister who is now in private business, said by telephone that what Mr. Obama said was a \u201chistoric precedent.\u201d He said that President Bush had spoken about ending the occupation that began in 1967, but that Mr. Obama\u2019s formulation suggested an equal exchange of territory in a final deal. Mr. Obama stated that the solution should be based on the 1967 lines with mutually agreed land swaps, meaning that if, as expected, Israel held on to some close-in settlements, it would have to yield an equal amount of land to the future state of Palestine from within its borders. This formulation goes beyond what President Bill Clinton called for in 2000 and is in keeping with one of two key Palestinian demands for a return to direct peace negotiations. The other is at least a temporary freeze in Israeli settlement building, which Israel has rejected. Whether the Palestinians could be persuaded to return to talks with only one of their two conditions met was unclear. Fares Akram contributed reporting from Gaza.",

        "article": "As we rub our eyes and reflect on the final night of the 2011 baseball season, one question surfaces: Where does it rank among the greatest days in baseball history? It depends on your definition of greatest, of course. When the social implications are included, April 15, 1947 -- Jackie Robinson's debut \u2013 has to top any list. But let's frame the question around on-the-field drama involving more than one game. If there was a more compelling night of baseball than Sept. 28, 2011, it escapes the memory. For starters, it was the first time in the 17-year history of the wild card that teams in both leagues were tied for the final playoff spot entering Game 162. And then the way it played out: Two extra inning games, one come-from-behind victory in the bottom of the ninth. Two teams down to their last strike. The irony of Boston's Carl Crawford coming up short on Robert Andino's game-winning liner in Baltimore, setting the stage for his former team to complete the greatest September comeback in history. And oh yeah, four more games to decide home-field advantage in the first round of the playoffs \u2013 Texas winning its game and No. 2 seed on a home-run in the top of the ninth. Cue the Four Seasons hit, Oh, What a Night. We have to rank it a notch above the final day of the 1967 American League pennant race. (Funny how the Red Sox are involved in these things, no?) Here's the rest of our Top 5: 2. Oct. 1, 1967. Entering the day, Boston and Minnesota were tied for first, playing at Fenway. Detroit was one-half game back, playing a doubleheader against the Angels at Tiger Stadium. The Red Sox beat the Twins 5-3 behind Jim Lonborg and completed The Impossible Dream when the Tigers lost the second game. 3. Oct. 4, 1964. The Cardinals and Reds entered the final day of the 1964 season tied for first in the National League, with the Phillies (post-collapse) a game behind and playing in Cincinnati. The Cardinals hosted the lowly Mets, who had beaten them two in a row. Philadelphia beat the Reds. St. Louis needed four innings of relief from ace Bob Gibson (on one day's rest) to come from behind to defeat New York 11-5 and avoid a three-way tie for the pennant. 4. Oct. 2, 1949. The Yankees-Red Sox race was chronicled by David Halberstam in The Summer of '49. The teams were tied going into the final day, with the Yanks winning, 5-3. Meanwhile, the Brooklyn Dodgers needed to go 10 innings in Philadelphia to beat the Phillies and hold off the St. Louis Cardinals, who started the day one game behind and won. 5. Oct. 1, 1995. The first year of the wild-card gave fans a hint of what was to come with the expanded format. Seattle entered the day with a one-game lead over California in the AL West and tied with the Yankees for the wild card. The Angels and Yankees won while the Mariners lost, giving New York the wild card and setting up a one-game playoff for the AL West, which Seattle won. And in the NL, Colorado entered the day with a one-game lead over Houston for the wild card, securing the postseason with a win as Houston also won. If we include the postseason, Oct. 15, 1986 has to be mentioned. First, a candidate for the greatest game ever: the New York Mets beat the Houston Astros in 16 innings to win the NLCS in six games (and avoid a Game 7 in the Astrodome against Mike Scott). Then the Red Sox (there they are again) defeated California in Game 7 of the ALCS to complete their comeback from a 3-1 deficit in the series. For pure history, May 1, 1991 ranks high. Rickey Henderson broke Lou Brock's career stolen base record while 44-year-old Nolan Ryan pitched his seventh no-hitter. Or Oct. 7, 2001: Tony Gwynn's final game and Henderson collecting hit No. 3000 in San Diego. Houston and St. Louis played for the NL Central title (although both has clinched playoff berths). Too bad Cal Ripken played his final game the previous day. We're sure we missed some; let us know in the comments. Baseballrace.com is nice resource for the research.",

        "article": "WASHINGTON, May 15 \u0097 The Bush administration announced Monday that it would re-establish full diplomatic ties with Libya because Libya had abandoned its nuclear and other unconventional weapons programs and helped in the campaign against terrorism. The decision ends more than 25 years of hostility while sending a strong signal to Iran and North Korea to follow suit. Along with the normalization of relations and the announced intention to open a new embassy in Tripoli, the administration removed Libya from the list of nations that are state sponsors of terrorism. The United States had reaffirmed Libya's place on that list as recently as March. The announcements were a result of Libya's surprise decision in 2003 to renounce terrorism. At the time, senior American officials said they believed that Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the Libyan leader, had taken that step because he was chastened by the American invasion of Iraq. Since then, Libya has also destroyed its chemical weapons stockpiles and dismantled a secret nuclear weapons program. \"Libya is an important model as nations around the world press for changes in behavior by the Iranian and North Korean regimes,\" Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said. Hers was just one of several similar statements on Monday from senior officials who worked hard to turn Libya's change in behavior into a lesson for Iran as a resolution on Iran's nuclear development program remains stalled in the United Nations Security Council. So far, however, Iran has ridiculed Libya for its reconciliation with the West. But on Monday, Libya accepted the news enthusiastically and even promised to cooperate with the United States in at least one area in which it is ill equipped to offer help. \"We encourage America on the path of cooperation and we hope we will cooperate together through cultural debate to spread democracy around the world together,\" said Mustapha Zaidi, who leads Libya's Revolutionary Committees \u0097 an apparatus of Colonel Qaddafi's iron-fisted control of the country. The United States withdrew its ambassador from Libya in 1972 after Colonel Qaddafi renounced agreements with the West and repeatedly inveighed against the United States in speeches and public statements. After a mob sacked and burned the American Embassy in 1979, the United States cut off relations. But the relationship did not reach its nadir until 1986, when the Reagan administration accused Libya of ordering the bombing of a German discoth\u00e8que that killed three people. In response, the United States bombed targets in Tripoli and Benghazi. The most notorious of Libya's actions was the bombing in 1988 of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, which killed 270 people. Since then, Libya has accepted responsibility, turned over two suspects and paid families of victims more than $2 billion. Another payment of roughly $700 million is due now. Reactions from family members and others affected by the bombing were mixed. The State Department notified them of the decision in an e-mail on Monday morning. Susan Cohen of Cape May Courthouse, N.J., lost her only child in the plane crash. \"Qaddafi has triumphed,\" she said. \"This is all done for oil; that's all they care about.\" In 2004, however, relatives of 230 victims signed a letter to President Bush, urging that sanctions be lifted. The lifting unblocked funds for the settlement. Libya is a major oil-producing state and a member of OPEC, but David Welch, assistant secretary of state for the Middle East, insisted: \"This decision is not undertaken because Libya has oil. This decision is undertaken because they've addressed our national security concerns.\" While lifting sanctions on Libya, the United States on Monday listed Venezuela as a country that is not cooperating on terrorism. The State Department said the Venezuelan president, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, had given oratorical support to Iran and to the Iraqi insurgency and had provided aid to insurgents involved in drug trafficking in Colombia. \"Nobody is saying that Venezuela is actively sponsoring terrorism,\" said a State Department official speaking on condition of anonymity under department rules. \"But Venezuela has clearly shown a lack of interest in working with us in combating it.\" The listing of Venezuela means that the United States cannot sell it military equipment, but the officials said such sales are negligible now. For decades, Libya had been among the half-dozen countries that the United States routinely listed as state sponsors of terrorism, along with Iran, North Korea, Cuba, Syria and Sudan. In the latest terrorism report, published last month, the State Department noted that Libya had made progress. Henry Crumpton, the State Department's coordinator for counterterrorism, said in an interview that one development that helped lead to the decision was Libya's \"assistance in identifying some of the terrorist networks going into Iraq. \"They have been volunteering information; we've had a pretty dynamic discussion\" over the last year, he said. The United States opened an \"interests section\" in Libya two years ago, giving Washington a small diplomatic presence. Additional steps in 2004 opened Libya to American businesses, including energy companies. Matthew L. Wald and Steven R. Weisman contributed reporting for this article.",

        "article": "Some rays of light in the dim U.S. jobs picture are coming from well-known large companies. According to Indeed.com, a six-year-old website that aggregates job postings from all over, there are tens of thousands of jobs listed right now at America's biggest businesses and government agencies, including Blockbuster, Lowe's, Bank of America and Lockheed Martin. The picture offered by Indeed is not a precise one reflecting a number of actual jobs. Online listings often remain up after positions have been filled, and a company like Blockbuster ( BBI - news - people ) lists jobs whether or not it has openings, because it knows there's a constant churn of workers at its 3,000 retail stores across the country, so it's eager to attract a steady stream of applicants. Nevertheless, these numbers do offer a strong broad gauge of which companies are expanding and taking on the most new workers right now. Indeed.com culls listings from a plethora of job websites large and small, including the behemoths CareerBuilder and Monster, from online newspapers and classified ads and from companies' own sites. Indeed.com's users can slice and dice the listings in myriad ways, including by geographic area, profession, company name, salary range, part- or full-time job and permanent or temporary work. The company that ranks No. 1 on Indeed's big company list may surprise some, because Blockbuster has struggled lately with its financial health in the face of fierce competition from challengers like Netflix ( NFLX - news - people ). But spokeswoman Michelle Metzger says the Dallas operator of video rental stores is in the midst of \"transforming to a multi-channel company,\" and is still in hiring mode. However, another Blockbuster source concedes that many of the listings result from the ever-present need to staff the company's 3,000 stores. Only 21 of the 12,800 postings are for corporate jobs, as opposed to retail positions. Likewise, many of the listings at the No. 2 company, Lowe's ( LOW - news - people ), stem from the Mooreseville, N.C., home improvement company's nationwide retail reach, and a good deal of the job listings are for seasonal work. \"Spring is like our Christmas,\" says Katie Cody, a spokeswoman. At the No. 4 company, Petco, many of the jobs are at retail outlets, but the robust hiring picture at the San Diego pet supplier reflects Americans' love of their pets, even during recessionary times. \"We are continuing to grow and hire,\" reports the company's head of human resources, Charlie Piscitello. \"We're happy to report at Petco that the human-animal bond is alive and well. People increasingly treat their pets as family members.\" Others in the top 10: McDonald's ( MCD - news - people ); JPMorgan Chase ( JPM - news - people ); the federal government's Department of Veterans Affairs; Bank of America ( BAC - news - people ); Fastenal ( FAST - news - people ), a seller of industrial and construction supplies; and Wells Fargo ( WFC - news - people ).",

        "article": "True colours ... detail from Diann Bauer's Mad Hatters (2011). Click for the full image. Photograph: Diann Bauer/Paradise Row Diann Bauer's drawings and paintings are a riot, whipping violent visuals into a frenzy. There's a jubilant splicing of motifs from action films, Manga cartoons, 16th-century western art, Japanese prints, contemporary architecture and, most recently, political sloganeering. It all breaks out across her large-scale works in a wild jumble, like shards of light projected through a fractured prism, or a grotesque mass of flesh following a big explosion. In Battle Plans 1 (2007), rippling muscular hulks redolent of the pumped-up torsos of Baroque painting dissolve into strangely fleshy plumes of smoke culled from Japanese prints. Bludgeonerator (2006) similarly draws on Japanese art, melding samurai masks, limbs and clothing with the biomorphic forms of Zaha Hadid's architecture. There's a political punch to these puzzle-pictures. They dive headlong into a global culture hooked on aggression, confronting its allure to leave you shaky on your legs, both sickened and thrilled. In her current exhibitions, the Berlin-based American artist takes politics a step further. In fonts and colours that recall carnival wagons and psychedelic 1960s posters, the paintings that make up The Enemy Is Everything That Might Happen combine catchphrases from extreme left and rightwing groups and explore the overlap. In a direct piece of commentary, Mama Grizzly layers three different texts on top of each other. Conflating George Bush with Sarah Palin, a vast W stretches across the parameters of a huge Mama Grizzly shield. Rippling through all this are Karl Marx's words about history repeating itself, \"first as tragedy, then as farce\". Why we like her: Bauer's timely comic book drawing series Rush Limbaugh Is Sick is a ribald satire of American private healthcare policies and propaganda, including the \"death panels\" rumour put about by Palin and other Republican hardliners to tarnish Obama's national health provision proposal. It sends Limbaugh, the leading US DJ and de facto Republican spokesman, through a raucous learning curve that takes its stylistic cues from cult gay artist Tom of Finland. In another life: To prepare for her current show, the artist delved into cyberspace, creating a secret Facebook alter ego whose special interests include the Tea Party and whose favourite quote is: \"Give me liberty or give me death!\" Where can I see her? The Enemy Is Everything That Might Happen is at Paradise Row, London W1D, until 18 June; Rush Limbaugh Is Sick is at Kynastonmcshine, London SE14, until 17 July.",

        "article": "There\u2019s a new poll out, from Vanity Fair and 60 Minutes, showing that 24 percent of Americans don\u2019t think that Barack Obama was born in the United States. On MSNBC last night, Chris Hayes asked me about it, and I tried to suggest that polls like this should be taken with a large grain of salt \u2014 both because Americans will happily express all kinds of outlandish opinions to a pollster without necessarily meaning much by them (does almost half the public really believe in U.F.O.s, at least in any serious way? I\u2019m skeptical \u2026), and because public ignorance is vast and deep enough to account for a good-sized chunk of any apparently-scary fringe opinion. For instance, I suggested that a lot of respondents probably don\u2019t know that birthright citizenship is a requirement for the presidency, and that some respondents may not even be aware that Obama\u2019s birthplace, Hawaii, is actually one of the 50 states. Mark Finkelstein of the ever-vigilant Newsbusters pounced on this last comment, accusing me of pandering to liberals by suggesting that conservatives who \u201cquestion Barack Obama\u2019s place of birth are too dense to realize that Hawaii is a state of the union.\u201d I\u2019m not entirely clear on why Newsbusters feels compelled to defend the honor of the birther movement, but no, I don\u2019t think that people who tell pollsters that Obama was born outside the United States are necessarily \u201cdense.\u201d Some of them are quite intelligent: Conspiracy theories are generally the province of people who are high on I.Q. and low on common sense, and the more baroque narratives surrounding Obama\u2019s birth certificate are no exception, I\u2019m sure. Others, meanwhile, just haven\u2019t bothered to learn that much about the composition of the United States. Here\u2019s what Public Policy Polling found out, for instance, when they drilled down to find out where \u201cbirthers\u201d believe Obama was really born: 62 percent of Americans think Obama was born here, while 24 percent think he was not and 14 percent are unsure. 10 percent of the country thinks that he was born in Indonesia, 7 percent think he was born in Kenya, and 1 percent think he was born in the Philippines. That leaves 20 percent, which includes at least some people who correctly believe that Obama was born in Hawaii, but who don\u2019t consider Hawaii to be part of the United States. You read that right \u2014 6 percent of poll respondents think that Hawaii is not part of the country and 4 percent are unsure. [emphasis mine \u2014 RD.] This is an entirely typical result: Large percentages of Americans, poll after poll suggests, don\u2019t know what seem like basic facts about their country and the world. This isn\u2019t a right-wing or left-wing phenomenon; like conspiracy theories, ignorance about public affairs cuts across party lines. And it isn\u2019t even necessarily a devastating indictment of American culture: The fact that 31 percent of the country couldn\u2019t identify Dick Cheney as the vice president in 2007 suggests a certain ignorance about important national issues, but also, perhaps, a healthy detachment from politics and public affairs, and a salutary focus on the private sphere instead. What it definitely suggests, to return to where I began, is that shock polls showing that some percentage of Americans believe some utterly crazy thing shouldn\u2019t be taken all that seriously as barometers of the national mood. And in that vein, I\u2019ll leave you with a wise passage from Anthony Gottlieb\u2019s 2007 New Yorker essay on the new atheists, in which he picked apart their tendency to use polling data to \u201cprove\u201d the religious craziness of the American people: Interpreting the nature and prevalence of religious opinions is tricky, particularly if you depend on polls. Respondents can be lacking in seriousness, unsure what they believe, and evasive \u2026 In some religious research, it is not necessarily the respondents who are credulous. Harris has made much of a survey that suggests that forty-four per cent of Americans believe that Jesus will return to judge mankind within the next fifty years. But, in 1998, a fifth of non-Christians in America told a poll for Newsweek that they, too, expected Jesus to return. What does Harris make of that? Any excuse for a party, perhaps.",

        "article": "The weapons seized by NT Police. (Supplied, Northern Territory Police, Fire and Emergency Services) Northern Territory police have arrested seven people in relation to a spear fight at a remote indigenous community, east of Darwin last week, that left two men dead. The group was flown off Groote Eylandt to Darwin this afternoon, however police are yet to list the charges the seven are facing. Yesterday police confiscated spears, machetes, hammers and knives in relation to the fight sparked by a family feud. Video obtained by police shows a man being struck by a spear thrown by a member of the opposing group. Police believe the man who threw the spear was the second man killed. The fight began on Thursday afternoon in the Angurugu township on Groote Eylandt, after a man intervened in a fight between two women. One of the women was taken to hospital unconscious. The altercation escalated the next day with a spear fight involving as many as 60 people, that left a 19-year-old man and a 29-year-old man dead. Police declared the riot a major crime and extra officers were sent to the area to deal with any unrest. Commander Tony Fuller said yesterday there had been no further disturbances over the weekend, and the situation in Angurugu remained tense but calm. \"Our priority today will be to investigate the cause of Friday's disturbance, and to identify persons of interest in the death of the two young men,\" he said. \"This is a community in deep shock and mourning. \"We are respectful of Sorry Business requirements among relatives, and will work calmly and with care with Elders, families and residents to identify those responsible for the deaths. \"Our members face a difficult task locating those responsible. Some will have fled into the bush, while others have gone to ground elsewhere. \"Nonetheless, we appreciate the help provided by the community to date, and again appeal to anyone who might have information - especially video footage filmed on mobile devices - to come forward as soon as possible.\" Footage obtained by 9news.com.au shows a similar armed confrontation that occurred late last year in the same town. In the video, uploaded to YouTube, several men can be seen brandishing spears. Upon reviewing the most recent footage, Comm. Fuller said he understood why many in the community may be fearful of a revenge attack. \"We ask the offenders to make contact with local police so that we can make arrangements to protect them,\" he said. \"This is an extremely volatile situation which has been compounded by the death of another person on the island unrelated to this incident.\" Anyone with information about the attack is urged to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.",

Reporter Alison Parker, 24, and photographer Adam Ward, 27, were shot and killed Wednesday during an early morning broadcast for WDBJ in Roanoke, Va. -- the alleged evildoing of former colleague, Vester Lee Flanagan II, who worked under the name, Bryce Williams. The suspect shared video of the deadly attack, which also wounded the woman Parker was interviewing, to his Twitter and Facebook accounts before the social networking sites had them pulled down. Former Arizona congresswoman Gabby Giffords, who was shot in the head by deranged gunman Jared Lee Loughner at a public rally in Tuscon in 2011, addressed the incident on her Facebook page. \"Captain Mark Kelly and I are horrified to learn that two young journalists were murdered this morning doing the jobs they loved. While we don't yet know all the details of what happened this morning, we know than an attack like this on journalists is an affront to the values we share,\" reads a portion of the note. Loughner was sentence to life in prison after shooting Giffords, his intended target, and 19 others, six of whom died of their injuries. Presidential hopeful Ted Cruz was the first of the candidates to issue a statement about the tragedy. \"All of our thoughts and prayers are with the family, friends, and love ones of @WDBJ7's Alison and Adam,\" he tweeted. Hillary Clinton urged on a push for stricter gun control laws while remembering the victims. \"Heartbroken and angry. We must act to stop gun violence, and we cannot wait any longer. Praying for the victims' families in Virginia. -H,\" she tweeted. Florida Governor Jeb Bush also offered sympathy to the victims. \"Shocked by the horrific murders in Roanoke. Columba and I are praying for Alison, Adam and all those affected,\" he tweeted. Following reports that the alleged gunman shot himself, more celebrities and public figures chimed in online with heavy thoughts. Saddened by the deadly shooting in Virginia this morning. My thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends of the victims. My heart goes out to the victims and their families and to the family of journalists worldwide who risk their lives gathering the news. Ann and my hearts and prayers go out to the family and colleagues of @WDBJ7's Alison Parker and Adam Ward. Shocked and horrified by the news coming out of Virginia... To murder people and then live tweet about it?? It's sick. My heart goes out to the two journalists who were shot in Virginia this morning. My show airs on @WDBJ7 every day.

        "article": "A technical crew with The Orlando Eye safely evacuated all 66 stranded riders from the largest Ferris wheel on East Coast, an incident that shut down the attraction that towers 400ft over central Florida, authorities said. Orange County Fire Rescue spokeswoman Kathleen Kennedy told the Associated Press no one was hurt following the Friday afternoon incident and all were taken off in an operation lasting about three hours with help from several firefighters. She said the attraction, which is billed by operators as the largest observation wheel on the East Coast, had initially stopped for more than 45 minutes. Power was restored via a backup generator and a technical team at the attraction, backed by the firefighters, carried out the task of removing riders from the enclosed capsules after each was brought down to the platform, officials said. \u201cAll guests are safely evacuated,\u201d Kennedy told AP by phone Friday evening shortly after the last rider was removed about 7 pm. She said firefighters on ladders helped the ride technical team that manually opened the doors. Six elite rescue climbers with the fire rescue squad were dispatched but weren\u2019t needed for a climb, Kennedy said. They were part of a 40-person agency special operations team that had climbed the attraction in training before but \u2013 she said \u2013 \u201cthankfully\u201d such an aerial operation wasn\u2019t needed. Andrea Alava, a public relations manager for The Orlando Eye, issued a statement that the attraction had shut down as a safety precaution before the team went to a backup operation. She said its teams carried out the actual evacuation, not firefighters as some reports initially suggested. Merlin Entertainments PLC owns the attraction and a similar 442-ft observation wheel in Britain, The London Eye, according to Alava. At approximately 3.45 pm., the operating systems for the Orlando Eye indicated a technical default with the system that monitors the wheel position of the Orlando Eye. As a safety precaution, the attraction is designed to automatically shut down if communication with this system is interrupted,\u201d Alava said in an emailed statement. \u201cImmediately following the default, the operations team began working to resolve the matter to allow guests to disembark the attraction. A backup system was employed that allowed capsules to be moved to the platform and opened manually,\u201d the statement added. The statement said Eye representatives kept up two-way visual and audio communication with the riders \u201cto ensure their safety and comfort\u201d and that their priority was to ensure they safely disembarked. \u201cWith that completed, we are now focused on reinstating the systems and restoring full operations of the Orlando Eye,\u201d it added late Friday, apologizing to riders \u201cfor the inconvenience this caused.\u201d There was no immediate indication when the attraction would reopen. The Orlando Sentinel reported that some of those stranded were tweeting from the ride that it had been stopping and starting at one point as they waited to be taken off. One rider identified as Makayla Bell by the paper tweeted about 5.40 pm, \u201cyes we finally started moving! Hopefully we get down soon. They keep stopping hopefully to get people off.\u201d Kennedy said that all taken off were checked as a precaution but no one needed medical treatment. Photos on local media sites showed firefighters and others atop ladders around capsules that had been lowered to the platform. The attraction\u2019s website said the 400-ft wheel features fully enclosed and air-conditioned capsules and \u201cprovides breathtaking views of Central Florida\u201d including the Orlando skyline, nearby theme parks and the Kennedy Space Center on Florida\u2019s distant Atlantic coast on clear days. A fact sheet Alava provided said the entire attraction ways about 3 million pounds, and its central hub more than a Boeing 737 alone; each of its 30 air-conditioned capsules is able to hold up to 15 people and The Orlando Eye rotates at 1 mph, affixed with more than 64,000 color-changing LED lights for an array of colorful light displays.",

        "article": "A: This reader had thought he'd installed a simple Gmail-downloading app when he had really downloaded a more complex synchronization tool, then didn't notice what was going on until he checked in at Google's site. The combination of software involved may be a little esoteric, but the underlying problem \u2014 granting an app unnecessary access to your data and then forgetting about it \u2014 is not. After asking for help in one of Google's tech-support forums, he learned that the problem was the \"Enhanced Gmail\" app, developed not by Google but by BlackBerry maker Research In Motion. He only discovered that this program had uploaded his contacts when he saw those contacts listed in his Google profile. Then he saw them vanish from his phone after he deleted them from Google. The fix involved returning to the BlackBerry's e-mail-setup screen, selecting the Gmail account in question and then scrolling down to clear a checkbox for contacts syncing. That was what he wanted in the first place: to use Gmail strictly as an e-mail inbox, not a gateway to Google's other services. I'd imagine that most of you won't have this particular issue. The BlackBerry isn't the most popular phone these days, and Google's own mobile apps should be a more obvious choice for Gmail access on RIM's phones anyway. But many of us probably do have all sorts of other data-synchronization relationships that we set up a long time ago and have since forgotten about. Do you remember how many apps can see your Facebook friends list, access your Gmail or post as you on Twitter? A few weeks ago, Andy Baio observed in a cautionary piece for Wired.com that he had \"49 apps connected to my Google account, 80 to Twitter, and over 120 connected to Facebook.\" (Because all of these sites let you approve a third party's request for access using a sort of secret-handshaking feature called OAuth, you don't need to provide your password to that app \u2014 which may lead people to be more generous at granting permission than they would have been otherwise.) Baio suggested visiting a site, MyPermissions.org, that links directly to the app-permissions pages of 16 Web services, including Facebook, Google, Twitter, Yahoo, Windows Live, LinkedIn, Foursquare, Dropbox and Instagram. You'll need to log into each service separately to see these details; this is not yet another site requesting access to your account credentials. I'm happy to repeat that endorsement here. Visit this free site, see what programs and services can borrow your keys to these services, and think carefully and skeptically to decide if they still deserve that privilege. Even though Google provides a perfectly good onscreen keyboard in its Android operating system, some Android phone vendors can't seem to resist inflicting their own, lesser keyboards on users. On Motorola's Droid Bionic, for instance, the default keyboard would suggest corrections but not actually make them for me. Samsung's Galaxy Note provided the opposite problem: I was constantly thumb-wrestling with an overactive keyboard that tried to auto-complete words even as I was backspacing over my own typos. You can usually veto these choices and either return to Google's own \"Android keyboard\" or switch to an alternate bundled by the vendor, such as the ingenious Swype. Hold down a finger (aka, \"long-press\") in a blank text-input area like the browser's address bar, and you should see a short menu pop up with \"Input method\" listed. You can also change keyboards in the Settings app's \"Language & keyboard\" category. Rob Pegoraro is a tech writer based in Washington, D.C.

But like their counterparts everywhere, Chinese gays and lesbians are fired up by the growing global debate on same-sex marriage. In late February, Beijing residents Ma Yuyu and her partner Elsie went to the Civil Affairs Bureau in the city\u2019s Dongcheng district to try to register as a married couple. They had contacted local media ahead of their visit and a gaggle of journalists accompanied them. To no one\u2019s surprise, their application was flatly rejected. \u201cWe knew we would fail, but we still wanted to do it anyway,\u201d Ma tells TIME. The rejection of their marriage bid made headlines across the country. With advocates like Ma pushing the envelope, the discussion on the legal status of the gay and lesbian community in China is evolving quickly. The visit to China two weeks ago of the openly gay Icelandic Prime Minister, Johanna Sigurdardottir, and her wife sparked a flurry of interest in Chinese social media. One woman from the city of Chongqing wrote an open letter to the world\u2019s first openly gay head of state explaining how she had discovered her own daughter\u2019s homosexuality and praising Sigurdardottir\u2019s \u201cpioneering spirit\u201d for helping the mother come to terms with it. (MORE: Coming Out in China: The True Cost of Being Gay in Beijing) Society, however, is nowhere near to accepting equal rights for gays and lesbians. Every year since 2003, prominent sociologist Li Yinhe has submitted a call for same-sex marriage to the Chinese People\u2019s Political Consultative Conference, the advisory arm of government. Every year the proposal has been rejected \u2014 though this year it generated more public discussion than ever before, in part because of Ma\u2019s attempt to get married and in part because of Chinese media interest in the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s review of the Defense of Marriage Act. For Li \u2014 one of the first Chinese female academics to specialize in sexuality \u2014 marriage equality is one of the ways she hopes to reduce homosexuality\u2019s stigma. \u201cSocial discrimination is one of the biggest problems homosexuals are facing in China,\u201d she says. \u201cThey are facing extreme pressure from their families to get married to someone from the opposite sex.\u201d A major reason for this is the country\u2019s one-child policy. A gay couple will, in the eyes of many parents, bring two family lines to an end at once. Ma, herself a single child, recalls that when she told her mother about her sexual orientation, her mother couldn\u2019t accept it. \u201cShe simply pretends we never had that conversation and gets short-tempered every time I try to bring it up.\u201d (MORE: Beijing\u2019s Gay Community Fights Censorship) The extreme pressure to raise a family has forced many homosexuals in China to enter into heterosexual relationships. Reports by Chinese media suggest that as many as 90% of China\u2019s gays choose to get married to a member of the opposite sex rather than endure family censure. This phenomenon has created its own social problems, says Li, as the husbands or wives of gay partners try to deal with their partner\u2019s sexual orientation. \u201cIt has even created a new type of marriage where [members of a] gay couple marry [members of a] lesbian couple,\u201d says Li. While she continues to work on submitting proposals in favor of gay marriage, Li is not optimistic that there will be a change in the law anytime soon. The community, she says, has no voice in China, and their needs have been ignored for a long time. \u201cThere are no gay representatives in the People\u2019s Congress,\u201d Li adds, \u201cso it\u2019s very hard for their voice to be heard.\u201d Ma, too, doesn\u2019t foresee any radical shift on official attitudes toward gay marriage. \u201cI don\u2019t think it will happen in the near future,\u201d she says, \u201cat least not in the next 10 years.\u201d In the meantime, with countries like Argentina, Denmark, South Africa, New Zealand and Sweden recognizing same-sex marriage \u2014 and with several states in the U.S. following suit \u2014 China\u2019s gay and lesbian couples can only look on in envy.

        "article": "Sweden\u2019s new centre-left government has indicated that it intends to formally recognise the state of Palestine \u2013 making it the first major European country to do so. The move is significant because it comes amid a diplomatic push by Palestinians at the UN to secure a security council resolution setting a two-year deadline for Israel to end its occupation of Palestinian territories and East Jerusalem by November 2016. Separately on 13 October British MPs will be asked to vote on a motion \u2013 put forward by the Labour MP Grahame Morris \u2013 calling on the UK to recognise Palestine. The announcement by the Swedish prime minister, Stefan L\u00f6fven, will be seen as a significant boost to the recent Palestinian campaign to push forward and seek unilateral recognition following the collapse of the US-sponsored peace process earlier this year. Recognition by Sweden would be seen as a significant diplomatic blow to Israel, which was warned by the White House last week that it risked alienating \u201ceven its closest allies\u201d if it continued with settlement building. The Swedish announcement came as the EU joined Washington in harshly criticising last week\u2019s announcement by Israel of planning approval for 2,600 new housing units in a settlement across the green line. Calling the decision \u201chighly detrimental\u201d to efforts for Israeli-Palestinian peace, the EU\u2019s diplomatic service said: \u201cThis represents a further highly detrimental step that undermines prospects for a two-state solution and calls into question Israel\u2019s commitment to a peaceful negotiated settlement with the Palestinians.\u201d European diplomats have long warned the government of Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu that it risks a climate of increasing international isolation in the absence of meaningful peace negotiations and while settlement building continues on land seized by Israel in 1967. The UN general assembly approved the de facto recognition of the sovereign state of Palestine in 2012 but the European Union and most EU countries have yet to give official recognition. With Sweden\u2019s reputation as an honest broker in international affairs and with an influential voice in EU foreign policy, the decision may well make other countries sit up and pay attention at a time when the Palestinians are threatening unilateral moves towards statehood. However, there is likely to be strong criticism of Sweden from Israel, as well as from the United States and the EU, which maintain that an independent Palestinian state should only emerge through a negotiated process. Within the EU, some countries, such as Hungary, Poland and Slovakia, recognise Palestine, but they did so before joining the 28-member bloc. If the centre-left government fulfils its plans, Sweden would be the first country to recognise Palestine while being a member of the European Union. The Social Democrats and Greens hold a minority of seats in parliament and the incoming centre-left government is likely to be one of Sweden\u2019s weakest for decades. The former centre-right government would not recognise Palestine as the Palestinian authorities did not control their territory. The Palestinians want an independent state in the West Bank and Gaza, with its capital in East Jerusalem.

        "article": "Coach Phil Jackson, leaving the court in Dallas after Sunday's Game\u2026 (Wally Skalij / Los Angeles Times) For six months, the Lakers' third time was a charm. On Sunday, it resolutely and reprehensibly crumbled into a curse. The expectations were too heavy. The distractions were too large. The bodies were too weary. The heart was too faint. And, believe it or not, the Dallas Mavericks were too good, the NBA's softest playoff team pounding the Lakers into sweeping submission with a 122-86 victory to finish off a four-game sweep of the second-round playoff series. \"I don't know where we lost it ... that drive, that bond we had in the past, that cohesive drive in order to overcome adversity,\" said Lamar Odom. They weren't just beaten, they were embarrassed by two punk moves that led to ejections, humiliated by a crowd that sang and jeered them off the court, and shamed into an uncertain future. \"It's going to be a l-o-o-o-ng summer,\" said Ron Artest. It's been a long three years, with the two-time defending champions finally collapsing under the weight of issues both personal and professional, a lack of locker-room trust tearing apart their fabric on the court. \"This is the worst I've ever seen the Lakers play in a game that they need,\" said Magic Johnson, team vice president, during a televised halftime show. In the horrific final two hours Sunday, they didn't pass, they didn't shoot, and they didn't guard anybody, raising a white flag that allowed the Mavericks to tie an NBA playoff record with 20 mostly wide-open three pointers. The Mavericks put a broom to so much more than one team and one season here, clearing the NBA postseason not only of its marquee franchise, but perhaps removing all traces of them for the foreseeable future. They have no coach. They have no bench. They have little money to get better quick. \"The Lakers fans have had their hearts broke,\" said Artest. \"And all those people who aren't Lakers fans are now laughing at the Lakers fans.\" Swept away was Phil Jackson's 20-year coaching career, his 1,973rd and final game possibly his worst, his resume of 11 championships now containing the smudge of a man who finally lost control of his club. In his trademark emotionless style afterward, a retiring Jackson admitted that the burden of attempting to win a third title was too much. \"A lot of strain on a basketball club from all angles -- personalities, spiritually, emotionally,\" he said. \"It was a challenge bigger than we could beat.\"",

        "article": "There was no grand entrance at this library, no sweeping staircase to preside over, and certainly no tourists to pose with for photos. Maybe that\u2019s why this pair of stone lions was sleeping on the job. The Bronx cousins to that grand pair on Fifth Avenue, Patience and Fortitude, could use a few pointers in looking lionly. The lions, each weighing about 900 pounds, sprawled lazily on stone pedestals in the late afternoon sun on Wednesday, their eyelids closed to the busy stream of children and stroller-pushing mothers passing between them every few minutes to go in and out of the New York Public Library branch in Riverdale. \u201cWhy are they sleeping?\u201d demanded Robert Ernau, 41, a subway cleaner, as he stopped to look at their faces. \u201cSomeone has to wake them up.\u201d The lions have been the subject of a monthlong naming contest among library patrons. More than 200 entries have been received, including Rest and Peace, Honor and Justice and, in a nod to Disney\u2019s ever popular Lion King, Simba and Scar. The contest, which ends on Friday, will culminate in a naming ceremony on April 12. The Bronx lions were relocated to the Riverdale library in January after their home of many years, the Loews Regency Hotel on Park Avenue, began undergoing an extensive renovation designed to \u201cepitomize Manhattan sophistication.\u201d The hotel decided that the lions, a fixture at the front of the hotel, were better suited elsewhere, and donated them to the public library. (James S. Tisch, chief executive officer of Loews, is also a member of the board of the New York Public Library.) Library officials said that the Riverdale branch, which circulates about 12,000 books and DVDs a month, had ample space for the lions. \u201cIt\u2019s a very popular branch,\u201d said Amy Geduldig, a spokeswoman for the library. \u201cIt does a lot of good in the community and we thought our patrons there would appreciate it.\u201d As for the history of the lions, that remains a mystery even to their previous owner, with no record of who carved them or why. Still, Lark-Marie Anton, a spokeswoman for the Loews hotel, noted that \u201cthey were fond members of the family and we\u2019re ecstatic that we\u2019ll be able to visit them in their new home.\u201d The lions have company at the Riverdale library, joining two (live) goldfish inside who have been named Goldi and Locks by children. Though the Bronx lions are much smaller than the lions that have stood sentry outside the main library branch on Fifth Avenue for over a century, and are rough-hewn stone instead of polished Tennessee marble, they have been welcomed with open arms. Indira Urbano, 10, said she hugged first one lion and then the other when it appeared two days later. \u201cWhen I walk in, I always look at them,\u201d she said. Jackson Spence, 9, said he came up with the name Honor to go with his 5-year-old sister\u2019s suggestion of Justice for the lions. Their mother, who grew up on the Upper West Side, has told them about visiting what she called the Lions\u2019 Library, referring to the Fifth Avenue branch. \u201cIt used to be plain here,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cThis kind of brings it to life a little more.\u201d Jackson\u2019s mother, Anna Spence, added that naming the lions would weave them into the fabric of the neighborhood. \u201cIt personalizes the library more,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re sort of a small town in Riverdale and the library is our hub.\u201d But still there were the inevitable comparisons. Gabriel Hallinan, 19, a student at Hunter College, said he did not notice the lions at first because they were rather unimpressive. \u201cYou always wish if you had lions at your library, they would be more upright,\u201d he said. \u201cThey looked not so much virtuous as sleepy.\u201d But Aaron Hasson, a teacher, said it was a nice touch that the lions had not gone to waste even if they were not exactly up to guarding the Riverdale library. \u201cSometimes, you get tired and just want to relax and have a little catnap,\u201d Mr. Hasson, 69, said. \u201cI know where they\u2019re coming from.\u201d",

        "article": "Bruce Brier's new job must seem like sweet revenge. Brier, a tax attorney at Lehman Brothers, was laid off in 2008 after he was portrayed in a Wall Street Journal story in September 2007 to be raising concerns years earlier that single-stock swaps -- a type of derivative -- could be viewed simply as a maneuver to sidestep withholding taxes on stock dividends. (Days before Lehman collapsed, the Senate Subcommittee on Permanent Investigations held hearings on the controversial practice of using derivatives to avoid withholding taxes on stock dividends.) Now Brier is working on unwinding Lehman Brothers Holdings as one of 600, mostly former Lehman Brothers employees, who are involved in the liquidation of the now-bankrupt Wall Street securities firm. Brier couldn\u00b9t be reached for comment this weekend. A spokeswoman for Lehman Brothers Holdings declined to comment. He is one of countless ex-Lehman employees who have landed in surprising spots ever since the New York investment bank collapsed last fall. Many Lehman alumni are working on Wall Street, of course, taking jobs at Barclays Capital which acquired the firm in the U.S. or elsewhere. But scores of others have ventured far from finance. A top lieutenant to former Lehman Chief Executive Richard Fuld, Scott Freidheim, has landed in the retailing world, working at Sears Holdings. Friedheim parlayed his ties to financier Eddie Lampert -- both fostered their friendship living in Greenwich -- to snag his new job, say former Lehman associates. Freidheim couldn\u00b9t be reached for comment. Another Lehman alum has traded Wall Street for being inside the Beltway. In financial circles, Lehman was viewed as a Republican firm, though, like most banks, Lehman gave to both political parties. Not long after it collapsed, its long-time political affairs analyst Kim Wallace joined the Obama administration as the Treasury\u00b9s assistant secretary for legislative affairs where he will advise Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner on legislative strategy among other things. The bad blood between Lehman and the Treasury Department over the state's refusal to bail out the New York bank clearly didn't hurt Wallace's job prospects. Perhaps it's because the Lehman executive was an early contributor to the campaign of President Barack Obama, according to Federal Election Commission records. (Wallace also gave money to presidential contender Hillary Clinton, now Secretary of State.) Neither a Treasury spokeswoman nor Wallace returned calls for comment Friday.

        "article": "Play ball! From the impromptu games of \"town ball\" in the 1800s, through Jackie Robinson's Montreal Royals to the Expos and Blue Jays, Canadians have always been infatuated with baseball. But getting big league teams to come to Canada proved harder than hitting a grand slam. It took decades of persuading, promoting, wheeling and dealing, but eventually America's favourite pastime found a home in the great white north. The first game by a Canadian major league team takes place in New York on April 8, 1969 when the Montreal Expos visit Shea Stadium to take on the New York Mets. Then, on Monday, April 14, 1969 at 1:35 p.m., the first Major League Baseball game in Canada begins as the Expos host the St. Louis Cardinals. Surprisingly, the Expos win both games. CBC Television's 1969 Sports Year in Review looks at the team's debut. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 The Expos had a tough first game. The opposing pitcher was the Mets' Tom Seaver, who became 1969's Sportsman of the Year. The Mets won the World Series later that year.\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 The first Expos game was a wild one, marked by bad pitching and a lot of errors. Relief pitcher Dan McGinn hit the first Expos home run during the third inning, and the Expos held on to beat the Mets 11-10. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 The Expos home opener on April 14 was no less wild. Stadium workers were still bolting in seats and shoveling snow as the first fans arrived. The Expos faced the previous year's National League champions, the St. Louis Cardinals. In front of 29,184 fans, the Cardinals' Dal Maxvill hit a grand slam, but the Expos' Mack Jones hit a three-run homer, and the Expos won 8-7. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Two weeks into the season, on April 17, Expos pitcher Bill Stoneman threw the team's first no-hitter against the Philadelphia Phillies for a 7-0 win. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 The San Diego Padres were also added to the National League in 1969. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 The Expos and Padres finished their first seasons with identical records: 52 wins and 110 losses, tying for last place in the National League. Also on April 14: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 1975: Ontario Court of Appeal rules that divorced women can sue their former husbands for damages. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 1992: The Supreme Court, citing new evidence, rules unanimously that David Milgaard's 1970 murder conviction in the death of Saskatoon nursing aide Gail Miller should be quashed and recommends a new trial.

        "article": "Gretchen Reynolds on the science of fitness. The more physically active you are at age 25, the better your thinking tends to be when you reach middle age, according to a large-scale new study. Encouragingly, the findings also suggest that if you negligently neglected to exercise when young, you can start now and still improve the health of your brain. Those of us past age 40 are generally familiar with those first glimmerings of forgetfulness and muddled thinking. We can\u2019t easily recall people\u2019s names, certain words, or where we left the car keys. \u201cIt\u2019s what we scientists call having a C.R.S. problem,\u201d said David R. Jacobs, a professor of public health at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis and a co-author of the new study. \u201cYou can\u2019t remember stuff.\u201d But these slight, midlife declines in thinking skills strike some people later or less severely than others, and scientists have not known why. Genetics almost certainly play a role, most researchers agree. Yet the contribution of lifestyle, and in particular of exercise habits, has been unclear. So recently, Dr. Jacobs and colleagues from universities in the United States and overseas turned to a large trove of data collected over several decades for the Cardia study. The study, whose name is short for Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults, began in the mid-1980s with the recruitment of thousands of men and women then ages 18 to 30 who underwent health testing to determine their cholesterol levels, blood pressure and other measures. Many of the volunteers also completed a treadmill run to exhaustion, during which they strode at an increasingly brisk pace until they could go no farther. The average time to exhaustion among these young adults was 10 minutes, meaning that most were moderately but not tremendously fit. Twenty-five years later, several thousand of the original volunteers, now ages 43 to 54, were asked to repeat their treadmill run. Most quit much sooner now, with their running times generally lasting seven minutes or less, although a few ran longer in middle age than they had as relative youngsters. Then, the volunteers completed a battery of cognitive tests intended to measure their memory and executive function, which is the ability to make speedy, accurate judgments and decisions. The volunteers had to remember lists of words and distinguish colors from texts, so that when, for example, the word \u201cyellow\u201d flashed onto a screen in green ink, they would note the color, not the word. (The participants did not undergo similar memory tests in their 20s.) The results, published last month in Neurology, are both notable and sobering. Those volunteers who had been the most fit as young adults, who had managed to run for more than 10 minutes before quitting, generally performed best on the cognitive tests in middle age. For every additional minute that someone had been able to run as a young adult, he or she could usually remember about one additional word from the lists and make one fewer mistake in distinguishing colors and texts. That difference in performance, obviously, is slight, but represents about a year\u2019s worth of difference in what most scientists would consider normal brain aging, Dr. Jacobs said. So the 50-year-old who could remember one word more than his age-matched fellows would be presumed to have the brain of a 49-year-old, a bonus that potentially could be magnified later, Dr. Jacobs added. \u201cIn other studies, every additional word that someone remembered on the memory test in middle age was associated with nearly a 20 percent decrease in the risk of developing dementia\u201d in old age, he said. In essence, the findings suggest that the ability to think well in middle age depends to a surprisingly large degree on your lifestyle as a young adult. \u201cIt looks like the roots of cognitive decline go back decades,\u201d Dr. Jacobs said. Which would be a bummer for anyone who spent his or her early adulthood in happy, heedless physical sloth, if the scientists hadn\u2019t also found that those few of their volunteers who had improved their aerobic fitness in the intervening years now performed better on the cognitive tests than those whose fitness had remained about the same or declined. \u201cIt\u2019s a clich\u00e9, but it really is never too late to start exercising,\u201d Dr. Jacobs said, if you wish to sharpen your thinking skills. This study did not examine why exercise may increase brainpower. But, Dr. Jacobs said, other studies, including some that have used the same data from the Cardia study, suggest that out-of-shape young people have poor cholesterol profiles and other markers of cardiovascular health that, over time, may contribute to the development of plaques in the blood vessels leading to the brain, eventually impeding blood flow to the brain and impairing its ability to function. \u201cThe lesson is that people need to be moving throughout their lives,\u201d Dr. Jacobs said.",

        "article": "A man waves an equality flag after a marriage equality rally in Montclair, New Jersey. Photograph: Carlo Allegri/Reuters Activists are working to line up judges who could waive the three-day waiting period for New Jersey same-sex couples who want to exchange vows first thing on Monday, when gay marriage will become legal in the state. Garden State Equality executive director Troy Stevenson said on Saturday that the effort to get couples hitched without the waiting period was a \"work in progress\". Under state law, couples must normally wait 72 hours after applying for a marriage license before they can tie the knot. Stevenson didn't have specific details on how many judges would be available to consider couples' waivers this weekend. But he said many marriages would be held across the state as soon as possible, once the new policy takes effect at 12.01am on Monday. On Friday, the New Jersey supreme court refused to delay a lower-court order for the state to recognize same-sex marriages while the state appeals. The justices said they did not think the state's arguments were likely to prevail in the end and that delaying the lower court's order would hurt couples who would not be eligible for federal benefits until they can be married legally in New Jersey. The Republican governor Chris Christie's administration had asked the court to delay gay marriages while it considered a broader case. On Friday, before the high court's ruling, a judge denied a request from Jersey City request to waive the three-day requirement. It is not clear how much of an obstacle that will be. Officials also noted on Saturday that state law says couples married legally elsewhere can wed in New Jersey without a waiting period \u2013 a provision that appears to apply to many New Jersey couples. The ruling puts New Jersey on the cusp of becoming the 14th state and the third most populous among them to allow same-sex marriage. The advocacy group Freedom to Marry said that as of Monday one-third of Americans will live in a place where same-sex marriage is legal. Meanwhile, on Saturday many same-sex couples continued to scramble to plan their ceremonies. They were reaching out to florists, photographers, catering firms, banquet halls and other wedding-related businesses to see what was available on short notice. \"Just imagine having only three days to do three months of wedding planning,\" Stevenson joked. Justin Jordan, a photographer who shoots many weddings in southern New Jersey, said he had heard from \"numerous couples\" since Friday's decision. \"Many people have been waiting anxiously for the chance to get married, and now that they have the chance to do it, they're jumping at the opportunity,\" Jordan said. \"But they're also realizing everything that goes with a wedding, like getting a photographer or video person, buying flowers, arranging for food \u2026 it's a daunting task when you have months to plan, let alone a few days.\" Jordan said many callers told him they wanted to get married as soon as possible, while others were planning to wait. Officials in towns across the state were preparing for a rush of weddings. Newark mayor Cory Booker and David DelVecchio, mayor of the gay-friendly community of Lambertville, both plan to lead ceremonies for gay couples at 12.01am on Monday. A handful of towns were opening offices on Saturday to accept applications for marriage licenses from same-sex couples. Amy Quinn and Heather Jensen applied for a marriage license at 8am Friday in Asbury Park, the town where they live and where an influx of gay couples during the last decade has been a major part of the area's revival. Their plan was to be married the second they were eligible to do so. But by Friday afternoon, Quinn said she didn't know precisely when that would be, or where. She is spending the weekend doing wedding planning on the fly. \"There was another couple that got their license today \u2026 they got a photographer,\" said Quinn, a member of the Asbury Park City Council. \"I've got to step up, right?\" Not everyone in a long-term relationship was rushing to get married. Jay Lassiter of Cherry Hill said he and his partner will talk about marriage now. \"I'm actually now having to confront my relationship issues,\" he said. \"This is going to force a lot of gay couples to have a lot of serious discussions.\"",

        "article": "Updated JAN 25, 2015 10:26p ET Seattle Seahawks All-Pro safety Earl Thomas promises he will play in the Super Bowl and will remain fearless when he gets on the field. Thomas pronounced his separated left shoulder ''pretty good'' when the team arrived Sunday for the Super Bowl. He was injured in Seattle's overtime victory against Green Bay a week ago for the NFC championship. He left the game but returned, and says there is no way he won't face New England next Sunday. After delivering a message to U.S. troops that he is ''banged-up, just like you guys probably are, and I am going to fight through it,'' Thomas relayed a story from when he was a youngster playing Little League. A ground ball hit him in the mouth and his lip stuck to his braces. His father took Thomas to the emergency room at a hospital for treatment, and then asked his son if he wanted to go back to the baseball game. His immediate reply was ''of course.'' ''This is me,'' Thomas said. ''I love competing. I am just glad we are reliving our dreams. It feels like a movie.'' Thomas added that tackling the likes of star tight end Rob Gronkowski will be a challenge he will meet in the Super Bowl. If his approach is strong, Thomas adds, his physical status won't be an issue. ''If my mental is right, my body just mirrors that,'' said Thomas, who returned to practice Friday. ''It's a lot to deal with, my first major injury. I got the big picture. ''When I come alive nothing is limited. I can still play fearless and throw my body around and whatever happens, happens.'' Seattle's other All-Pro defensive back, cornerback Richard Sherman, has an elbow injury that he also dismissed as a non-factor for next Sunday. The Seahawks know they need both Thomas and Sherman as close to full strength as possible against the potent Patriots. If the Legion of Boom is not, well, booming the opposition, particularly in this matchup, Seattle will be in trouble. ''Richard practiced in all the practices and he looks to be fine,'' coach Pete Carroll said. ''He still has an elbow to take care of, but he's practiced well. Earl practiced (Saturday), the day before and got the last day of practice in and looked fine. Both those guys are scheduled to play and should be OK. They have to deal with their issues, but they'll be playing in the football game.'' Thomas can't wait. He sees his team on the verge of a memorable achievement. ''I am too young to be thinking about legacy right now,'' the 25-year-old Thomas said, ''but sometimes you don't have to say anything because your work speaks for itself. So we definitely have that on the table.''",

        "article": "No person alive has been more closely associated, for so long, with America\u2019s triumphs in the early days of the Space Race than John Glenn, and few Americans in history have served their country in as many high-profile and varied roles: First American to orbit the earth; decorated Marine Corps veteran (in both WWII and Korea); novice, eager politician; seasoned, savvy, multi-term United States senator; space shuttle crew member \u2014 across seven decades, Glenn has lived much of his personal and professional life in the public eye. But it was during a remarkably brief, heady period in the late 1950s and early 1960s when Glenn first entered the national consciousness and became, in a very real sense, the public face of the American space program. Here, in a gallery filled with pictures made by some of LIFE magazine\u2019s finest photographers, the 92-year-old, straight-talking Ohio native shares his memories and insights on one of the most thrilling, inspiring, nerve-wracking eras in the nation\u2019s history, as well as his own career as pioneering astronaut and fledgling, earnest candidate for public office. (Note: Most of these photos never ran in LIFE magazine.) [See the gallery: \"Magnificent Seven: America\u2019s Mercury Astronauts.\"] \u201cAmerica was in something of the doldrums when Project Mercury began,\u201d Glenn recalled in an interview with LIFE.com, painting a picture of the era during which he and his fellow astronauts \u2014 the Mercury 7 \u2014 helped fire the nation\u2019s imagination about the prospects of space exploration. \u201cWithin the memory of an awful lot of people, we\u2019d come through the Great Depression, World War Two and the Korean War. We weathered the Depression, we won the Second World War \u2014 but then we fought to a stalemate in Korea. No one had a very good feeling about that, and quite a few people began questioning whether America\u2019s greatness was a thing of the past. \u201cThe space program helped restore our confidence as a nation. It wasn\u2019t designed to do that, of course. But looking back, I think what we accomplished as astronauts went a long way toward bringing people out of the doldrums of the late fifties and early sixties, and I\u2019m proud to have had a hand in that. You don\u2019t set out to create a myth or hero worship around yourself or your colleagues,\u201d Glenn told LIFE.com. \u201cBut you do become aware of it. You\u2019d be numb if you weren\u2019t aware of it. But we just tried to live up to it the best we could, and hoped we might be an inspiration. \u201cOf course,\u201d Glenn continues, \u201ca crucial element of our program was competition with the Soviets. They were claiming technical superiority, and were taking thousands of kids from Third World countries, educating them in Russia, and sending them back to their homes as dedicated little commies. In their view, they were proving their technical superiority to us by the fact that their rockets were succeeding, and ours were, far too often, blowing up on the launch pad. We didn\u2019t believe they were superior to us, technically \u2014 not by a long shot. So there was definitely that intense, Cold War mentality attached to much of what we did.\u201d [Read TIME's salute to John Glenn.] And yet, while the Cold War was the larger, geopolitical framework in which the Space Race played itself out, Glenn makes clear that there was always another quieter \u2014 but no less intense \u2014 scientific, and even a metaphysical, force driving the advances of era. \u201cAll of us looked at Project Mercury as far more than a job,\u201d Glenn says. \u201cYou know, we already had jobs flying jets, we were all test pilots, and that was interesting enough in its own way. But thinking of this other extraordinary leap forward, the space program, as just another job? No, it was never quite that simple. Human beings have been looking up at the sky for millennia, wondering what\u2019s up there. And all at once, here we were, with the chance to actually go. It was something brand new, and it was hugely exciting.\u201d [See all of LIFE's Space Race galleries.] Finally: A story that reveals as much about John Glenn as any of the countless tales of his cool, professional demeanor or his unquestioned grace under pressure. LIFE photographer Ralph Morse told LIFE.com that while covering Project Mercury for the magazine, he noticed that Glenn sometimes switched the \u201csuitcase,\u201d or portable ventilation unit, from one hand to the other while training for his orbital flight. (See slide #9 in this gallery.) Intrigued, he asked Glenn about it. \u201cI said to him, \u2018Glenn, you\u2019re a big, strong guy,\u2019\u201d Morse recalls. \u201c\u2018Why do you keep switching that suitcase from hand to hand? It can\u2019t be tiring you out.\u2019 \u201cWell, he got sort of worked up, then,\u201d Morse says. \u201c\u2018Damn it Ralph,\u2019 he says to me. \u2018You\u2019re the only person who\u2019s ever noticed that.\u2019\u201d It turns out the hand-switching was a signal Glenn worked out with his wife, Annie. When he knew she was watching from home on an old-fashioned video feed, of sorts, that NASA hooked up for them, he would switch hands as a way of telling her, from a distance, I love you. \u201cIf that story was told about anyone else,\u201d Morse recalls, fondly, \u201cit would seem impossibly corny. Of course it would! But that\u2019s the sort of guy John Glenn was, and that\u2019s a side of him the public hardly ever saw.\u201d \u2014 Ben Cosgrove is the Editor of LIFE.com",

        "article": "Apple might have its hands full with Ireland and taxes, but another lawsuit has cropped up that it\u2019ll now need to face. Three iPhone owners have filed a lawsuit against Apple in the U.S. District Court for Northern California, alleging that Apple had kept a defect with its iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus models a secret and subsequently declined to fix it. The problem relates to the recently revealed \u201cTouch Disease,\u201d a term coined by hardware-repair firm iFixit to describe the bug plaguing both the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. Last week, the company said in a blog post that it only appears to affect the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, but not Apple\u2019s newer iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. According to the company, the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus have chips that sit inside the device that allow the screen to interact with touch inputs. However, those \u201cTouch IC chips\u201d connect to the device\u2019s main board with small soldered balls that, over time, can crack and start to lose contact between the display and the board. The issue is caused by regular use and eventually, iFixit explained, the iPhone 6 line\u2019s touchscreen functionality will be lost, leaving users with a device that\u2019s practically unusable. While it\u2019s impossible to know for sure how widespread the problem is, many Apple forum sites are displaying comments from iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus users who say they\u2019re experiencing the problem. The folks over at iFixit say they, too, have come across the problem on several occasions. For its part, Apple has largely remained silent about the possible problem, leading to the lawsuit filed in the California court on Monday. According to the plaintiffs, who all own iPhone 6 models, they are hoping to turn the so-called Touch Disease in the iPhone 6 into a nationwide class-action lawsuit against Apple. They added that after seeking repairs from Apple, the company would only offer to replace their phones for a cost of more than $300 rather than fix the issue. The plaintiffs said Apple was engaging in \u201cunfair, deceptive, and/or fraudulent business practices,\u201d according to MacRumors, which obtained a copy of the entire lawsuit. The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages from Apple and want the company to either repair, recall, or replace the iPhone at no cost to customers. They\u2019re seeking a jury trial to decide the case. For its part, Apple hasn\u2019t responded to Fortune\u2019s request for comment on the lawsuit. Ironically, the lawsuit on the iPhone 6 line, which launched in 2014, came on the same day Apple announced a special press event for September 7, when the company is expected to unveil a new iPhone, likely known as the iPhone 7. It also came just before Apple was slapped with a $14.5 billion tax bill by the European Union. This article originally appeared on Fortune.com",

        "article": "(CNN) -- WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said he'll leave the Ecuadorian Embassy in London \"soon\" after living there for two years to avoid extradition to Sweden. \"I can confirm I am leaving the embassy soon, but not for the reason you might think,\" Assange said at a news conference Monday. He did not provide additional details but said he is suffering from health problems and would leave \"when conditions are right.\" However, WikiLeaks said, \"his departure is not imminent.\" Ecuador's foreign minister, who sat next to him, said his freedom is long overdue. \"The situation must come to an end ... two years is too long,\" Ricardo Patino said. \"It is time to free Julian Assange. It is time for his human rights to be respected.\" Swedish authorities want to question him over allegations that he raped one woman and sexually molested another. He denies the allegations and describes them as politically motivated. \"I've not been charged with an offense in the UK or Sweden,\" he said Monday. Patino said Swedish prosecutors have disregarded offers to get evidence from Assange via video conference or send prosecutors to the embassy. As a result, he said, the case remains unresolved years later, an injustice to both Assange and the two women. \"The end result is these requests have not been heeded,\" Patino said. Assange says he fears Sweden will transfer him to the United States, where he could face the death penalty if he is charged and convicted of publishing government secrets through WikiLeaks. Last month, his lawyers argued that the detention order against him should be revoked. But Stockholm District Court Judge Lena Egelin ruled that Assange is still suspected, with probable cause, of sex crimes and his detention order should remain in place. After the decision last month, prosecutor Marianne Ny said the warrant could remain in place until the statute of limitations takes effect -- five years for unlawful coercion and 10 years for rape. Assange rocketed to international fame when WikiLeaks began publishing secret government documents online. In addition to the Guantanamo procedures manual, it also published documents related to U.S. activities in Iraq and Afghanistan, and diplomatic cables from U.S. embassies. In August 2010, Swedish prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for him over allegations of sexual assault from two female WikiLeaks volunteers. He turned himself in to London authorities the same year, and was remanded in custody. At the time, a judge ruled that he should be extradited to Sweden, and Assange launched a series of appeals that went all the way to the British Supreme Court. It denied his appeal. In June 2012, Assange fled to the Ecuadorian Embassy to seek asylum, which was granted in August of the same year. He's been living at the embassy in London since then. Caution thrown to wind as WikiLeaks breaks gag order CNN's Sara Delgrossi, Atika Shubert and Claudia Rebaza contributed to this report.",

        "article": "Updated Dec 5, 2013 1:55 AM ET As time wound down in the Trail Blazers' victory over the Oklahoma City, LaMarcus Aldridge was showered with shouts of \"MVP! MVP!\" from the Portland fans. Aldridge had a season-high 38 points and added 13 rebounds in the Blazers' 111-104 win Wednesday night that snapped the Thunder's eight-game winning streak. It was his ninth double-double and 15th game with at least 20 points this season. He made a career-high 17 field goals. \"Just surreal. It was humbling to have that moment here,\" Aldridge said of the crowd's reaction. \"I've been here so long and I've had very few of those type of chants here. So that was fun. I thought that made the night complete for me.\" The victory gives the surprising Blazers a 16-3 record this season, best in the Western Conference and second only to Indiana overall. Portland has won 14 of its last 15 games, a stretch that includes an 11-game winning streak. Nicolas Batum's 3-pointer with 29.9 seconds to go all but sealed it for Portland, which had lost seven straight against Oklahoma City. The Thunder led by as many as 12 points in the first half, but Aldridge led a third-quarter rally and Portland built a 91-84 lead on consecutive 3-pointers from Dorell Wright and Damian Lillard with 7:58 left. Russell Westbrook's 3-pointer pulled the Thunder within 95-94 before Reggie Jackson's two free throws gave them a short-lived lead with 5:34 to go. Aldridge hit a layup and a jumper to make it 105-100 for the Blazers. Durant and Westbrook narrowed it again with consecutive baskets, but Batum's 3-pointer made it 108-104 before Durant missed a 3 on the other end. The Blazers made free throws for the final margin. Durant finished with 33 for the Thunder, who were playing the second game of a back-to-back after defeating Sacramento 97-95 Tuesday night. Westbrook had 21 points. \"He was shooting turnarounds from almost the 3-point line over the top of our bigs and knocking them down,\" Durant said of Aldridge. \"That's what great players do, they come through in the clutch and make shots.\" Batum and Lillard added 14 points apiece for the Blazers, who were coming off a 106-102 victory over Indiana on Monday. Portland is 8-1 at home. Aldridge scored 16 of his points in the third quarter, when the Blazers outscored the Thunder 35-21. \"I don't know if I have the words, to be honest,\" Blazers coach Terry Stotts said of Aldridge's night. \"Offensively, obviously he can score. But I liked his toughness, I liked his leadership, I liked his competitive fire. As much as he played very well, it was a lot of the intangibles that I really appreciated from him tonight.\" Wright's bank jumper evened the game at 27 to start the second quarter. It was close throughout the half, with Portland's Batum on Durant much of the time. Durant took off on a fast break for a dunk and added a free throw to give the Thunder a 55-47 lead, their biggest of the game to that point. Westbrook attempted a 3-pointer and the refs called a foul on Portland's Wesley Matthews, prompting an angry reaction from Stotts, who was given a technical, and the Thunder finished the half on a 9-0 for a 59-48 advantage. Durant led all scorers in the half with 17 points. \"They hit a lot of tough 2s on us, shots we can live with,\" Durant said. \"But they made enough to beat us.\" One bright spot for the Blazers was center Robin Lopez, who had 12 points and five rebounds in the first half. Acquired by the Blazers from New Orleans in a three-team offseason trade, Lopez finished with 12 points and 10 rebounds. Batum's 3 got the Blazers within 67-64 before Matthews' layup got them within one midway through the third quarter. Batum's pull-up jumper gave Portland a 70-69 lead, and Aldridge added a long jumper. The Blazers clung to the lead until Durant's jumper tied it at 78, but Aldridge answered with a turnaround jumper to cap a 10-point streak for the two-time All-Star. \"I've been saying it from the start -- he's the best power forward in the game,\" Matthews said NOTES: Oklahoma City is 9-0 at home but 4-4 on the road. ... Portland has lost only one game at home this season. ... Oregon State receiver Brandin Cooks and running back Storm Woods were at the game. The Beavers (6-6) are waiting to see if they're headed to a bowl in the postseason. ... Oregon Ducks receiver Josh Huff was also at the game. ... Coming off a six-game home stand, Oklahoma City is playing three games in four nights before heading home to face Indiana on Sunday. ... Lopez has seven double-doubles this season.",

        "article": "The Food and Drug Administration just granted permission for \u201cexpanded access\u201d to an experimental medicine for Ebola. It\u2019s OK as far as it goes, but it\u2019s an exception to the FDA\u2019s reluctance to approve the use of life-saving products. Safety and efficacy testing of the drug, designated TKM-Ebola, has barely begun, and quantities are extremely limited. It will be given to patients with confirmed or suspected Ebola infections, but not as part of a clinical trial. As a 15-year veteran of the FDA, that decision surprised me \u2014 not because it was bad on the merits, but because it represents a peculiar setting of priorities. To put it less charitably, FDA routinely drags its feet on the approval of products critical for the prevention or treatment of fatal diseases that are far more common in this country than Ebola. Why expend the agency\u2019s time and energy on a drug that will be used rarely, if at all, in the United States? Consider the saga of Bexsero, a vaccine for meningitis B. Since the first vaccine for bacterial meningitis was approved in 1974, immunization has significantly reduced the threat \u2014 but a vaccine for MenB took much longer to develop. Bexsero was approved last year by the European Union, Australia and Canada \u2014 but it still hasn\u2019t gotten an FDA OK, though outbreaks continue to occur on US campuses. (The most recent one killed a Georgetown University student this month.) Citizens have shown initiative while bureaucrats stall. The mother of a UC-Santa Barbara student sent her son to England to be immunized with Bexsero. In four years of [FDA] delay, IPF will have killed more than 150,000 US patients. And the mother of a woman who died in Michigan has organized bus trips for dozens of people, mostly college-age kids, to Windsor, Ontario, where she arranged for the group to be seen by a doctor and vaccinated. Another example: pirfenidone, a drug meant to treat a pulmonary disorder called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or IPF, which kills tens of thousands of Americans each year. The disease\u2019s cause is unknown, and there are no FDA-approved therapies. But pirfenidone is marketed in Europe (since 2011), Japan (2008), Canada (2012) and China. The drug won EU approval on the basis of three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies \u2014 one done in Japan and the other two in Europe and the United States. Why is the FDA waiting? In 2010, an advisory committee of outside experts recommended approval, but agency officials demanded another major clinical study. The results, published last May, were impressive. Pirfenidone markedly improved several laboratory and clinical measures of lung function and, most important, reduced the probability of death from IPF. The FDA will probably OK the drug by year\u2019s end. But in four years of delay, IPF will have killed more than 150,000 US patients. Economist Diana Furchtgott-Roth has described similar delays in the approval of drugs to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis and diabetes. It seems (literally) dead obvious: The FDA bases priorities on factors other than data and the nation\u2019s medical needs. Africa\u2019s Ebola outbreak is front-page news, so the FDA grants expanded access for an Ebola drug. Similarly, the FDA last spring brokered the creation of a clinical trial specifically to get an experimental anti-viral drug to a young cancer patient suffering from an adenovirus infection after a bone marrow transplant. Again, fine on the merits \u2014 except that this effort was expended for a single patient and only after the agency was subjected to \u201cintense pressure\u201d from the public on Facebook and Twitter. This sort of decision-making violates the social contract between civil servants and the public: In return for lifetime tenure, bureaucrats are supposed to make decisions that are dispassionate, data-driven and in the public interest. Instead, the FDA moves faster on life-saving treatments mainly when it knows the public is watching. FDA civil servants have failed miserably to hold up their end of the bargain. We deserve better. Dr. Henry I. Miller was the founding director of the FDA\u2019s Office of Biotechnology. He\u2019s now the Robert Wesson Fellow in Scientific Philosophy and Public Policy at the Hoover Institution.",

        "article": "Appearing on the \u201cToday\u201d show Tuesday morning, Engel, 39, said his captors were part of a government militia known as Shabiha, which is loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Engel described the kidnappers as Shiite Muslims, trained by Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard and allied with Hezbollah. The kidnappers told the journalists they wanted to exchange them for four Iranian agents and two Lebanese Shabiha members who had been captured by the rebels, Engel said. That plan was thwarted when the kidnappers unwittingly drove into a rebel checkpoint while trying to move the captives to a new location. In the ensuing gunfight, two of the group\u2019s captors were killed. \u201cIt is good to be here. I am very happy that we\u2019re able to do this live shot this morning,\u201d Engel, NBC\u2019s chief foreign correspondent, said on \u201cToday.\u201d He said he, producer Ghazi Balkiz, cameraman John Kooistra and two other crew members were driving Thursday through what they thought was a rebel-held area in Syria, accompanied by rebel fighters, when about 15 heavily armed men, their faces obscured by ski masks, \u201cjust literally jumped out of the trees and bushes at the side of the road.\u201d The gunmen executed one of the rebels \u201con the spot,\u201d Engel said. They took the NBC crew to a series of safe houses and interrogation places near the town of Ma\u2019arrat Misrin, keeping them blindfolded and tied up. Engel, Balkiz and Kooistra, who appeared together on \u201cToday,\u201d said they were not hurt physically but were subjected to \u201cpsychological torture,\u201d including threats that one or all of them would be killed. \u201cThey made us choose which one of us would be shot first, and when we refused, there were mock shootings. They pretended to shoot Ghazi several times,\u201d Engel said, referring to Balkiz. \u201cWhen you\u2019re blindfolded and then they fire the gun up in the air, it can be a very traumatic experience.\u201d The men, who were under orders to remain silent, peeked under their blindfolds in quiet moments and exchanged jokes and words of support when they felt their guards would not hear. \u201cWe kept each others\u2019 spirits up,\u201d Balkiz said. Added Kooistra: \u201cI made good with my Maker. I made good with myself. I was prepared to die, many times.\u201d Monday night, as they were being moved to a new location, the group came upon the Ahrar al- Sham checkpoint, triggering the skirmish that led to the captives being freed. The names of the other crew members in the group were not released. NBC said there had been no claim of responsibility for the kidnapping, and no ransom demand. Although reports of their capture had circulated on social media, NBC had not confirmed the kidnapping publicly or made any statement about it. Other major news outlets, including The Washington Post, also refrained from reporting that the crew had been kidnapped. News organizations often fall silent when their personnel are taken captive, because they believe the journalists are more likely to be released if their disappearance does not draw media attention. Hazem al-Shami, a spokesman and fighter for Ahrar al-Sham, said the rebels had been on the lookout for the missing journalists, and had set up checkpoints to search for them. One of the checkpoints was near the town in Idlib province where the hostages were being kept. \u201cWhen they saw we\u2019re searching cars, they started to shoot at us,\u201d Shami said in an interview on Skype. \u201cSo we attacked them until the kidnappers ran away and the hostages stayed in the car.\u201d A statement on the Ahrar al-Sham Facebook page said the freed journalists included Turkish, British and American citizens, and one person who was described as Syrian-German. The group was \u201chosted in one of our houses for the night\u201d before being escorted to the Turkish border Tuesday morning, the statement said. NBC said the journalists are being evaluated and debriefed. Engel said all were in good health. The network \u201cexpressed its gratitude to those who worked to gather information and secure the release of our colleagues.\u201d The Syrian government has issued very few visas allowing journalists to report on the uprising that began in March 2011, so many reporters enter the country illegally by crossing from neighboring countries. The Committee to Protect Journalists reports that 15 journalists have been abducted in Syria in 2012. Eight have been released. Of the rest, one is believed to be in government custody, one is believed held with the rebel army, two were believed dead and the whereabouts of three are unknown, the organization said. The journalist who is believed to be in government custody is Austin Tice, a freelance reporter, who disappeared near a Damascus suburb last August. Tice, a former Marine, had contributed articles to The Washington Post, McClatchy Newspapers and other news outlets after crossing the border from Turkey into Syria in May.",

        "article": "A by-the-numbers look at the best U.S. cities for female entrepreneurs to get started\u2014and thrive in business. While women make up 50% of the U.S. adult population and account for 46% of the workforce, when it comes to entrepreneurism, they\u2019re behind the curve. All told, women account for only 35% of all people who get involved in starting a business. According to a new survey by the Kauffman Foundation on the Entrepreneurship Gender Gap, women trail men not just in share of entrepreneurial activity but in revenues (just 1.8% of female-led firms have revenues of over $1 million vs. 6.3% of male-led firms), patents (5.65% of female firms seek patent approval versus 13% of men) and job creation (36% of women-led firms create jobs to 44% of male-led firms). It\u2019s not all bad. \u201cThe great news is that we\u2019re absolutely seeing the number of female entrepreneurs skyrocket in the last year,\u201d says Leesa Mitchell, author of the Kauffman study, Overcoming The Gender Gap: Women Entrepreneurs As Economic Drivers. As an indicator she references female applicants to Astia, a community of entrepreneurs committed to the development of high-growth women-led firms: \u201cIn 2010 there were roughly 100 applicants. This year it was well over 400. The momentum is there\u2014it\u2019s happening, and I think it\u2019s going to mean some significant change on the playing field.\u201d It is against this backdrop that we present the ForbesWoman first annual list of the top 20 cities for women in business. Where are women best-poised for success and why? To create our list, we began with the FORBES Best Places For Business and Careers, as ranked by my colleague Kurt Badenhausen, for a pool of cities with high projected job growth, education levels and quality of life, and low cost of business. Then to tighten the scope for female entrepreneurs, we added new metrics: What cities have seen the biggest growth in the number of female-led firms in recent years? Where are the most SBA-backed loans going to women, and where are women turning those loans into million-dollar profits? With the numbers crunched, it wasn\u2019t surprising to see who came out on top. New York and San Francisco\u2013the Alley and the Valley\u2013are the cities where not only are more women launching businesses, but thanks to SBA-backed loans, they have an easier time finding funding and resources which they are quicker to parlay into big-time profits. \u201cBoth cities have strong ties to Web 2.0 activity and social media,\u201d points out Mitchell. \u201cBut they\u2019re also among our most diverse cities. In cities where diversity is the norm, we\u2019re seeing women stepping up more readily and far more readily embraced by the community.\u201d Rachel Balik, a communications writer at Achievers, a San Francisco-based employee rewards company which saw $24.5 million in Series-C funding this week attributes the boom to the unique communal energy of the startup community in Silicon Valley: \u201cDespite being the tech capital of the world, it still has a leftover Hippie vibe, where everyone genuinely wants to support each other. For women, there\u2019s none of that breaking the glass ceiling or trying to get into the old boys club. The playing field is level.\u201d But just a few steps down the list, real surprises emerge. Tampa, Fla., is known as a city of retirees and not entrepreneurism. But according to research by WomenAble and American Express OPEN, Florida brags the second fastest-growing state in terms of the number of new firms opened between 1997 and 2011. Women-led firms in the city received over $19 million in SBA-guaranteed loans in 2010. On the ground, a keyed in observer of the startup scene in Tampa, Liz Bollinger, the co-founder of Biz-E Chicks, a networking and development community for local women building startups, has seen her own explosive growth. Since 2006 the group\u2019s mailing list has grown from 10 subscribers to well over 500 women entrepreneurs, most entrenched in creative services like copywriting, marketing and photography. Bethesda, Md., and Washington D.C. both benefit from government contracts in the area, and women\u2019s earnings there are among the highest in the country, so their place among the top cities seems well-deserved. Then there\u2019s dark horse Columbus, Ohio. In 2008, FORBES named it the No. 1 pick for up-and-coming tech cities, largely due to the Battelle Memorial Institute, a research center that supports multiple federal agencies including the Department of Energy.",

Tillis is hovering around that threshold, according to a survey published Monday by the Democratic firm Public Policy Polling. If he fails to garner 40%, the top two candidates will go to a runoff in July. That would be a boon for Democrats\u2019 hopes of holding the Senate. The incumbent Senator, North Carolina Democrat Kay Hagan, is considered to be among the most vulnerable this cycle, and an additional three months of internecine warfare would hamper the eventual GOP nominee. But the race isn\u2019t just an opening skirmish in the battle for the Senate. It\u2019s also an early test for mainstream Republican grandees, who decided last fall to mount an unprecedented effort to defend vulnerable Republican incumbents and defeat shaky right-wing candidates who could jeopardize their chances of retaking the upper chamber in November. Tillis, who is facing a Tea Party-backed libertarian and a Baptist pastor in Tuesday\u2019s primary, has been buoyed by a tide of television ads run by establishment groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Karl Rove-founded super PAC American Crossroads. The Chamber and other Republican-leaning business groups have also spent heavily to defend Ohio GOP Rep. David Joyce, who faces a primary challenge Tuesday from a conservative state legislator in his northeast Ohio district. These two races are the first of many 2014 contests that pit the GOP\u2019s business-friendly moderates against a Tea Party faction that has alternately empowered and infuriated party elders since rising to prominence in 2010. Over the next month, primary voters across about 20 states are set to cast ballots that may help determine which wing of the party will prevail. Among the most competitive races are the May 20 primary in Idaho\u2019s Second Congressional District, where Republican Mike Simpson is facing a tough test from attorney Bryan Smith, and the June 3 GOP Senate primary in Mississippi, which sets six-term incumbent Thad Cochran against state senator Chris McDaniel. In both races, the incumbents have benefited from expensive ad campaigns by the Chamber of Commerce, while the challengers are getting big boosts from national conservative groups such as the Club for Growth and the Senate Conservatives Fund. But apart from select races such as these, Tea Party outfits have struggled in their quest to unseat the cycle\u2019s most vulnerable incumbents in some of the nation\u2019s most conservative states. Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell appears to be coasting toward victory in his primary fight against conservative challenger Matt Bevin. McConnell\u2019s top lieutenant, Sen. John Cornyn, sailed to victory in Texas, and Tennessee\u2019s Sen. Lamar Alexander looks set to do the same. Support for the Senate\u2019s immigration bill hasn\u2019t eaten into Sen. Lindsey Graham\u2019s yawning lead in South Carolina. Revelations about Sen. Pat Roberts\u2019 tenuous claims to residency in Kansas don\u2019t seem to have ruined his quest for a fourth term. And in Georgia, two arch-conservative Tea Partiers are lagging behind the rest of the pack in a messy five-way Senate primary. \u201cThey\u2019ve run weaker candidates,\u201d Scott Reed, chief political strategist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, says of the Tea Party groups. \u201cThey\u2019ve been all talk and very little action.\u201d If the GOP Establishment wins the first wave of primaries Tuesday, it will be a sign that the GOP\u2019s grandees are the favorites in the Republican civil war of 2014.",

        "article": "Recent research finds evidence that optimism pays off in job hunting and promotions. Ron Kaniel, Cade Massey and David T. Robinson studied the effect of an optimistic disposition on M.B.A. students' job searches and then promotions in the two years after they graduated. Kaniel is an associate professor of finance at the Fuqua School of Business at Duke University; Massey is an assistant professor of organizational behavior at Yale School of Management; Robinson is a professor of finance and William and Sue Gross Distinguished Research Fellow at Fuqua. Optimists fared better than their less-optimistic peers in some important ways, the researchers report in their September 2010 National Bureau of Economic Research working paper, \"The Importance of Being an Optimist: Evidence from Labor Markets.\" For one thing, the optimistically inclined MBA students found comparable jobs to their peers--but found them more easily, with less-intensive job searches. What's more, two years after graduation the optimists were more likely than their less-optimistic peers to have been promoted. The better job-hunting performance didn't appear to occur because the optimists had information that might objectively lead them to believe they would do better. For example, when the researchers asked the MBA students about their likely salary package in their first job, the optimists tended to predict that their starting earnings would be higher than average for their peers--but the optimists didn't, in fact, end up with above-average starting salaries. Kaniel, Massey and Robinson also asked the MBA students in the study to identify those students in their MBA section who were the most charismatic, the most likely to become CEOs or the most optimistic--to try to see if optimistic students were optimistic because they were more personable. In general, optimists did turn out to be perceived by their peers as more charismatic, but that accounted for only a fraction--approximately one-third at most--of the optimists' greater success in the labor market. To what is the rest of that success attributable? Kaniel, Massey and Robinson can't say for sure, but they note that other research has suggested that people who are optimistic by disposition are good at coping with problems and flexible about trying new courses of action when needed. And, the authors point out, there is the possibility of self-fulfilling prophecies. Interestingly, the researchers note that their findings suggest that appearing to others to be optimistic if you're not would yield some--though not all--of the job-hunting benefits of a naturally optimistic disposition.

        "article": "On Wednesday, India's Ministry of External Affairs released a video showing President Barack Obama's official visit to the country. The glitzy, eight-minute long video showcased a lot of the political achievements as well as the personal ones (Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi made Obama tea and the U.S. president joked about how little sleep they got). However, there was one major element of Obama's visit to India that went missing. As the Wall Street Journal first noted, when it comes to the U.S. president's final speech to students in Delhi, the MEA was selective: Obama's jokes and platitudes were mentioned, yet more provocative comments that some interpreted as a warning to Modi's Hindu nationalist government were omitted. \"India will succeed as long as it\u2019s not splintered along religious lines,\" Obama had said. \"In our lives, Michelle and I have been strengthened by our Christian faith. Still, as you may know, my faith has at times been questioned \u2014 by people who don\u2019t know me \u2014 or they\u2019ve said that I adhere to a different religion, as if that were somehow a bad thing.\" The president's call for religious freedom was hard to miss. \"Every person has the right to practice their faith how they choose, or to practice no faith at all, and to do so free from persecution and fear,\" Obama said. President Obama's remarks encouraging India to support women seeking an education and to embrace other's religious differences did not make it into the video the India Ministry of External Affairs released on his recent trip. (WH.gov) Modi, who has his roots in the right wing Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) group, has worked hard to escape allegations of sectarianism. Many of India's Muslims, however, find it hard to forget the deadly riots in Gujarat during his time as leader of state. In 2005, the U.S. government revoked a visa for Modi on the grounds that the had was responsible for violations against religious freedom, though as Modi became a national leader his relations with the U.S. improved. Additionally, Obama brought up woman's rights in India, another raw subject given concerns about street harassment and sexual assault in the country. \u201cEvery daughter deserves the same chance as our sons,\u201d Obama had said. \u201cAnd every woman should be able to go about her day \u2013 to walk the street, or ride the bus \u2013 and be safe and be treated with the respect and dignity that she deserves.\u201d While the MEA might like to forget it, Obama's speech in Delhi was perhaps his most high profile and it sparked a wave of debate in India. For many Indians, it may be the part of the trip they remember the most. Adam Taylor writes about foreign affairs for The Washington Post.

        "article": "US stocks have extended their post-US election rally with moderate gains that pushed the Dow above 19,000 and the three major indexes to record closing levels for a second straight day. The S&P 500 ended above 2,200, led by gains in telecommunications, up 2.1 per cent, and consumer discretionaries, up 1.2 per cent. The small-cap Russell 2000 index also set another record high close. Stocks have mostly rallied since the November 8 election. Investors see President-elect Donald Trump's promises of tax cuts, higher spending on infrastructure and less regulation as beneficial to certain industries, including banking, industrials and healthcare. Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth in New York, said the rally that started in financials and industrials just after the election is spreading to other sectors. \"You're seeing some strength across the board. That's a healthy sign and indicates to me that we're in a bull market,\" he said. \"The market started to give up some gains last week, but that didn't increase selling pressure. It actually drew people back in.\" The Dow Jones industrial average ended up 67.18 points, or 0.35 per cent, to 19,023.87, the S&P 500 gained 4.76 points, or 0.22 per cent, to 2,202.94 and the Nasdaq Composite added 17.49 points, or 0.33 per cent, to 5,386.35. All three indexes also hit record intraday highs. The Dow took 121 trading days to reach 18,000 points from 17,000, but has since crawled along, taking another 483 days to breach 19,000. The Dow is now up 9.2 per cent for the year so far, while the S&P 500 is up 7.8 per cent. But some market participants question if the rally is sustainable, with the S&P 500 trading near 17.3 times forward 12-month earnings, above the 10-year median of 14.7 times, according to StarMine data. Dollar Tree, up 8.2 per cent at $US88.68, was the biggest per centage gainer among discretionaries. The dollar-store chain reported a better-then-expected quarterly profit. The healthcare index, which saw a sharp run higher following the election, was off 1.4 per cent, leading the decliners. Medtronic tumbled 8.7 per cent to $US73.60 after the medical device maker reported quarterly revenue that missed expectations and cut its full-year adjusted earnings forecast. About 7.3 billion shares changed hands on US exchanges, compared with the 8.1 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.36-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.64-to-1 ratio favoured advancers. The S&P 500 posted 52 new 52-week highs and 6 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 319 new highs and 22 new lows.",

        "article": "CHICAGO \u2013 If the extreme heat and humidity lingering over much of the nation feels like a steam bath, it's because the same principles are at work in the atmosphere. Vast amounts of warmth and moisture have become trapped under a huge \"heat dome,\" bringing record-breaking temperatures and thick, topical air to scores of cities from North Dakota to the Ohio Valley. Now the system is moving east to spread the misery to some of the country's most densely populated areas through the weekend. As temperatures hovered around 100 near downtown Kansas City, Jeff Grembocki and other construction workers prepared Wednesday to pour concrete. Empty Gatorade bottles lay strewn around their job site. Grembocki said the heat saps his energy so much that he falls asleep soon after getting home. He only rouses for a couple of hours to watch TV before going back to bed. \"The air conditioning, when it hits you, it's all you can do to stay awake,\" he said. The dome forms when a high pressure system develops in the upper atmosphere, causing the air below it to sink and compress because there's more weight on top. That raises temperatures in the lower atmosphere, said Eli Jacks, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Silver Spring, Md. The dome of high pressure also pushes the jet stream and its drier, cooler air, farther north -- it's now well into Canada -- while hot, humid air from the Gulf of Mexico circulates clockwise around the dome, traveling farther inland than normal. Combined with generally clear skies and the sun's higher summertime angle, \"it gets really hot,\" Jacks said. The formation of the dome also explains why conditions in, say, North Dakota aren't much different this week than in Houston. The big difference is that people in Houston are accustomed to hot weather. Those in the north are not. \"In places where the highest temperature you ever expect is in the 80s and you're at 102, there are big health concerns,\" because fewer people have air conditioning or fans, Jacks said. \"Heat is the No. 1 killer out of all weather hazards.\" What's more, because of the humidity, even nighttime brings little relief. Humidity makes the weather feel far hotter because the body, which cools itself by perspiring, has to work harder when the air is already moist. \"It's harder to cool down,\" said Jannie Ferrell, a National Weather Service meteorologist. This difference is expressed by the heat index -- a measure of humidity combined with temperature. On Tuesday, the heat dome produced some eye-popping heat index readings: 129 degrees in Newton, Iowa, 122 in Gwinner, N.D., and 121 in Taylorville, Ill. The sweltering weather served to make life even more uncomfortable for people displaced by the flooding of the Souris River in Minot, N.D., where about 150 people are living in a tent city outside the an ice rink. \"The RVs all have air conditioners, but the tent folks have been moving their tents around trying to find shade,\" said Chuck Emery, manager of the Maysa Arena. The rink's air-conditioned basement has been converted into a kennel for campers' pets. Although heat domes are not rare, this one is unusually large and long-lasting. It began three days ago and may persist for seven to 10 days in some locations, meteorologists said. On Wednesday, it had begun moving out of Texas and the Dakotas, headed east and northeast. By Thursday, temperatures in Washington were forecast to hit 100, and the heat could linger for days along the Atlantic seaboard. Thunderstorms can develop around the perimeter of the dome -- called the \"ring of fire\" -- bringing temporary relief to some areas. But this dome is so large that the heat rebuilds quickly, said Kevin Birk, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Illinois. No widespread deaths have been reported, but the heat sent dozens of people to hospitals and disrupted many routine activities. As hot air blew over the cooler waters of Lake Michigan on Tuesday, a thick fog shrouded many of Chicago's beaches. Lifeguards had to turn away swimmers because they could not see beyond the water's edge. A Veterans Affairs hospital in Fargo, N.D., had to reschedule more than 50 surgeries after cooling systems struggled to keep up with the weather. Some floors and other surfaces became wet, potentially compromising the sterile environment needed to operate. In Detroit, more than 70 schools without air conditioning were to close Wednesday afternoon. Power outages and mechanical problems closed several others. Relief is on the way. Cooler air should begin moving into the Plains states this weekend, as a strong pool of air from the jet stream begins to push hot air out of the way in the Dakotas and into Minnesota before making its way east. By Monday, temperatures in many places will drop into the mid-80s, although cities in the East could still be sweltering. \"This is really an exceptional event, I think it's fair to say ... in terms of scope and duration,\" Jacks said. Back in Kansas City, the construction crew has been starting around 5:30 a.m. to get as much work done before the hottest hours of the day. Crew member Dan Danuser said he guzzles plenty of water while on the job. When he gets home, he retreats to a dark room. \"It's hard with all the asphalt and concrete around,\" Danuser said. \"It's different when you are out on grass and open areas. But when you get in town, there is no breeze, and the asphalt just makes everything hotter.\"",

        "article": "Updated Jun 22, 2010 8:46 PM ET Martin Demichelis and Martin Palermo scored second-half goals Tuesday to help Argentina beat Greece 2-0 at the World Cup and earn the two-time world champions first place in Group B. Argentina will play Mexico in the round of 16 on Sunday, while Greece has been eliminated. \"We are doing our duty. We are defending the Argentine jersey,\" Argentina coach Diego Maradona said. \"Mexico is not going to be easy, a very difficult opponent. But we are calm and we are going to receive Mexico with all the respect Mexico deserves.\" Demichelis scored from short range in the 77th minute after his header bounced off teammate Diego Milito and back into his path. Palermo doubled the score in the 89th from a rebound after Greece goalkeeper Alexandros Tzorvas saved a shot by Lionel Messi. Mnutes earlier, Messi's hard left-foot shot hit the near post. \"A well-deserved victory, no doubt about that,\" Greece coach Otto Rehhagel said. \"We wanted to avoid an early goal, we managed to do that, but of course Argentina has more class and that earned them the win.\" Maradona made seven changes to the lineup that beat South Korea 4-1 five days earlier. Captain Javier Mascherano and strikers Carlos Tevez and Gonzalo Higuain were all benched. However, Messi did start and he was given the captain's armband for the first time. It made Messi, who turns 23 on Thursday, the youngest Argentina captain ever. \"That was something very special,\" Messi said. \"I felt the constant support of my team mates. It was a beautiful experience.\" Midfielder Juan Sebastian Veron returned after missing the previous game with a right-calf injury. Only goalkeeper Sergio Romero, Demichelis, midfielder Maxi Rodriguez and Messi have been in on the team for all three of Argentina's games, ensuring the squad will be well rested for the round-of-16 clash with Mexico. \"They deserve a lot of respect,\" Maradona said of Mexico. \"Even though they lost, they have their identity.\" Although their game was less fluent than in previous matches, the two-time world champions dominated the match, espcially in the first half at the 45,000-capacity Peter Mokaba Stadium, where Argentina fans clearly outnumbered their Greek counterparts. \"My players played with their hearts and with excitement,\" said Rehhagel, who declined to comment on his own future as coach. \"But it was just not enough to cause Argentina much troubles.\" Argentina initially preferred to keep possession instead of pushing to create chances. The first shot on goal came in the 18th minute when Sergio Aguero picked up a pass by Veron and dribbled past two Greece defenders before his left-foot shot forced Tzorvas into a diving save. In the next minute, Tzorvas pushed the ball over the crossbar after a 30-meter (yard) attempt by Veron. In the closing minutes of the first half, Maxi and Messi both saw their powerful shots blocked by the keeper. \"We knew that if we put pressure on Greece, they would finally make a mistake,\" Maradona said. \"We did that very well.\" Aguero, Veron and Messi were the most active players. Milito was well neutralized by Greece's five-man defense, while Sokratis Papastathopoulos committed several minor fouls while shadowing Messi and Georgios Samaras was a lonely striker up front. Rehhagel had urged his players to produce the \"match of their lives\" to get a result against Argentina. However, the 2004 European champions left their defensive tactics in the second half, which soon gave Samaras his team's first chance, though the Celtic striker shot just wide after entering the penalty area from the left wing. Greece: Alexandros Tzorvas, Vangelis Moras, Alexandros Tziolis, Avraam Papadopoulos, Giorgos Karagounis (Nikos Spiropoulos, 46), Loukas Vyntra, Georgios Samaras, Vassilis Torosidis (Christos Patsatzoglou, 54), Sotirios Kyrgiakos, Sokratis Papastathopoulos, Costas Katsouranis (Sotiris Ninis, 54).

        "article": "Giuseppe Carotenuto was in Rome early Wednesday when a magnitude-6.2 earthquake shook the ground in central Italy. The photojournalist already had a go-bag ready: boots for climbing over rubble, a helmet for safety and a keffiyeh to cover his mouth from the dust. He left Rome at 4:30 a.m. and headed for the picturesque small town famous for a pasta dish. He arrived close to 6:30, following updates on the radio along the way. He expected the town, and its centuries-old homes and buildings that likely had not been reinforced, to be completely destroyed. \u201cIt is what I found,\u201d he tells TIME. The earthquake has left at least 250 people dead in the region. Amatrice, where he had visited three years ago for an assignment, is the hardest-hit towns with at least 193 fatalities as of Thursday afternoon. The toll is expected to rise as search-and-rescue operations continue. Carotenuto, from Pompeii, has covered everything from Europe\u2019s refugee crisis and Italy\u2019s army in Afghanistan to the conflict in Libya and 2009 earthquake in L\u2019Aquila that left more than 300 people dead. \u201cThere is one thing in common in all: the death,\u201d he says. \u201cThe death as a result of errors caused by humans.\u201d He began to shoot shortly afterward and worked through the day. Beautiful homes and buildings crumbled onto streets that were no longer recognizable. There were residents looking through the rubble, first-responders hunting for survivors and many people who could not comprehend the scale of the tragedy. \u201cThe survivors I met in the streets of Amatrice [were] shocked. Some did not understand what had happened and why they suddenly found themselves in the street,\u201d he says. \u201cThe silence was broken by the screams of the first rescuers, the phones ringing in the rubble, the smell of cement dust.\u201d One man who Carotenuto met was seated alone on the rubble of his home. He came back following several aftershocks to see what remained, and stayed there for about 10 minutes in silence. \u201cThis man didn\u2019t have words.\u201d Giuseppe Carotenuto is a photographer based in Rome.

        "article": "Scientists have long suspected that the lifespan of parents holds clues to how long their own children will live, and now a new study reveals that parents' longevity is linked to their offspring's heart health, too. So, long-lived parents may reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality in their kids, according to the study, which was published in the \"This research is important, as it shows that knowing the age at which your parents died provides information on your own risk of death and disease,\" said Janice Atkins, a research fellow at the in England and lead author of the study. \"Although people with longer-lived parents are more likely to live longer themselves, there are lots of ways for those with shorter-lived parents to improve their health,\" she added. \"Current public health advice about being physically active, such as going for regular walks, eating well and not smoking are very relevant, and people can really take their health into their own hands.\" The study involved 186,151 non-adopted adults, between 55 and 73 years old, with deceased parents. The researchers analyzed health data on each participant using the , a health resource that collects long-term health information on volunteers. The data were collected over eight years, and the researchers plotted the relationships between the participants' health and their parents' ages of death. It turned out that there was an inverse relationship between the age of a parent's death and the longevity of his or her offspring. When the parents reached about age 70 and older, their offspring's risk of death dropped by about 17%, compared with their counterparts, and continued to fall the longer the parents lived. \"The risk of death was 17% lower for each decade that at least one parent lived beyond the age of 70 years,\" Atkins said. Additionally, participants with longer-lived parents had overall lower incidences of heart disease, heart failure, stroke, hypertension, anemia, high cholesterol and atrial fibrillation compared with their counterparts. \"However, it is important to note that these results are group-level effects, therefore general tendencies, which do not directly apply to individuals,\" Atkins said. \"If people are exposed to the big health risk factors, this will be more important to health than the age at which their parents died.\" Such big health risk factors could include smoking, for instance. Atkins added that these findings should also be applicable to people in the United States. encourages American adults to document the health history of their family members, as family history is an important risk factor for common chronic diseases such as cancer, heart disease and diabetes. \"The relationship between parental age at death and survival and health in their offspring is complex, with many factors playing a role,\" Atkins said. \"The association is partly due to the inheritance of genetic risk factors for blood pressure and cholesterol level, among others,\" she said. \"Shared environment and lifestyle choices also play a large role, including diet and smoking habits.\" The findings add to growing evidence that there are probably genetic, environmental and behavioral factors \"passed down\" from parents to children that influence longevity, said Dr. Kenneth Langa, , who was not involved in the new study. \"The relationships between parental longevity and the health of kids are likely quite complicated and overlapping. I don't think that it is 'all genetics,' although it is likely that genetic relationships are certainly part of the story,\" Langa said. \"The study showed that children of long-lived parents had higher levels of education, income [and] physical activity and lower prevalence of smoking and obesity, suggesting that in addition to genetic links between the generations, there are likely behavioral links resulting from the home, and more general environment, in which one is raised,\" he added. Britt Heidinger, assistant professor in the department of biological sciences at North Dakota State University, agreed that the findings raise interesting questions about how much of the link between parents' and children's longevity is due to shared genetic or environmental backgrounds. \"For example, some of this relationship might be due to inherited factors, but parents and offspring are also likely to share many aspects of their environments that could impact cardiovascular health, including attitudes about diet and exercise,\" said Heidinger, who was not involved in the new study. \"Although studies have shown links between parental age and offspring longevity, more information is critically needed about the underlying mechanisms.\"",

        "article": "ATLANTA \u2014 The Georgia Dome, the host of the men\u2019s Final Four this year, is 21 years old and adequate as a site for major sporting events. But because more money can be made with a new stadium, a path is being cleared for the dome\u2019s extinction. So this is probably the last time a college basketball champion will be crowned at its climate-controlled environs. Better known for football, the Georgia Dome has a basketball history less memorable than that of its concrete cousin in New Orleans, the Louisiana Superdome, home of Keith Smart\u2019s shot and Chris Webber\u2019s timeout and Fred Brown\u2019s errant pass. Some would say the defining Georgia Dome moment came in 1996, when Massachusetts guard Carmelo Travieso leaned back against a curtain being used as a news media backdrop, thinking it was a wall, and fell off a makeshift platform. But such criticism sells the dome short. It has hosted some great college games, including its first one, on Dec. 19, 1992, a doozy between Georgia Tech and Louisville. An announced crowd of 28,885, at the time the largest to attend a basketball game in Georgia, saw the Yellow Jackets win, 87-85, on a 3-pointer at the buzzer by the sophomore James Forrest. The dome has hosted three other Final Fours, including the women\u2019s version. In 2002, the Maryland men\u2019s team capped a run to its lone national title behind the shooting of guard Juan Dixon and the interior play of Lonny Baxter and Chris Wilcox. Merely having the tournament finale in Atlanta that year was something of an uncertainty. The N.C.A.A. had considered moving the Final Four after protests from civil rights groups, including the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, over the flying of a Confederate battle flag over state buildings. After Georgia lawmakers agreed to redesign the flag, the games went on as scheduled. So did the 2003 women\u2019s Final Four, in which Connecticut defeated Tennessee in the championship game. In 2007, the men\u2019s Final Four was back on Northside Drive as Georgia\u2019s border enemy, Florida, came to town for a coronation. Dynastic college teams are seemingly the product of a bygone era, and the Gators of Joakim Noah, Al Horford and Corey Brewer may well be the last the sport will see for some time. The defending champions from Gainesville rolled into Atlanta and roundly dispatched U.C.L.A. and Ohio State, cruising past the Buckeyes despite a dominant performance by center Greg Oden. In 1995, Arkansas fell just short of repeating as national champion. Three weeks before falling in the title game, the Razorbacks were knocked off in perhaps the best game played at the dome, the Southeastern Conference tournament final. Arkansas was new to the conference, and hordes of fans yelling, \u201cWoooo, pig sooie!\u201d followed the team to Atlanta, determined to outcheer fans of Kentucky. The two teams and their vociferous supporters met in a rollicking final. The Razorbacks, using Coach Nolan Richardson\u2019s 40 Minutes of Hell pressure defense, opened a 35-16 lead, but the Wildcats fought back late to force overtime. The extra session featured more of the same. The Hogs jumped out to a 9-point lead, but once again Kentucky rallied, pulling out a 95-93 victory. The words March Madness generally evoke thoughts of opening-round upsets and classic finals, but the best basketball is often played in the regionals. The dome has hosted four regionals, probably none better than the one in 2006. First, Louisiana State knocked off top-seeded Duke, a victory sealed when Tyrus Thomas went end to end for a mammoth dunk. The Duke senior guard J. J. Redick wept as he left the floor, much to the derision of the crowd. In the Round of 16 nightcap, Texas appeared to have been Pittsnogled \u2014 the term ascribed to victims of the West Virginia cult hero and sharpshooting big man Kevin Pittsnogle, who sank his fifth 3-pointer to tie the score at 71-71 in the closing seconds. But the Longhorns senior Kenton Paulino replied with a buzzer-beating 3 to give Texas a victory. The Round of 8 matchup between Texas and L.S.U. two days later featured a memorably wild sequence in the final seconds, with several blocked shots and loose-ball scrambles, before Texas\u2019 Daniel Gibson drilled a 3 to send the game to overtime. But Glen \u201cBig Baby\u201d Davis hit a long shot of his own in the extra period to send L.S.U. to the Final Four. Surely, though, the most lasting memory of basketball at the dome was created five years ago, when a tornado ripped a hole in the roof during an SEC tournament quarterfinal between Alabama and Mississippi State. Nature\u2019s fury struck moments after Alabama guard Mykal Riley rattled home a 3-pointer that sent the game to overtime. Had Riley missed, thousands of fans may have walked directly into the storm, which hammered the dome with a 130-mile-per-hour wind. The damage forced the tournament to move to Georgia Tech\u2019s nearby arena, where only the cheerleaders, the bands and a small contingent of fans saw Georgia complete an improbable run to the SEC tournament title, gaining an automatic N.C.A.A. tournament bid when none was otherwise forthcoming.",

        "article": "Though it may feel out of the way \u2014 far, far east on the Lower East Side \u2014 there\u2019s no missing American Realness once you get there. In its seventh edition, this annual festival of contemporary performance announces itself boldly, its name projected in big block letters on the facade of Abrons Arts Center, home to most of the festival\u2019s 18 boundary-blurring productions. It doesn\u2019t take much to inject new life into an event sometimes at risk of stagnating, even as it champions the fresh, the unseen, the unexpected. At opening night on Thursday, visitors were guided from show to show through stairwells and hallways generally closed to the public. For anyone well acquainted with Abrons, as many Realness-goers are, this proved a simple, effective way to reinvent familiar spaces. Masterminded by Thomas Benjamin Snapp Pryor, Realness coincides with the citywide conference of the Association of Performing Arts Presenters \u2014 international curators and producers in the market for new work \u2014 which returns each year like a recurring dream, or nightmare, depending on your relationship to the idea of shopping for live art. Last year\u2019s festival was full of work bemoaning the economic plight of performers; this year\u2019s first two productions struck out in less sullen directions, while still folding in some self-reflexive critique (also available in the form of Realness swag declaring, \u201cI Suffer From Realness\u201d). First was \u201cCulture Administration & Trembling,\u201d a biodiverse collaboration among the performers Jennifer Lacey, Antonija Livingstone, Dominique P\u00e9trin and Stephen Thompson. Ticket holders were instructed to remove their shoes, then led to the second floor of the arts complex, where a usually drab lobby had been transformed with geometric and botanical designs on the floor and walls. Ms. Lacey, Ms. Livingstone, Mr. Thompson and Dana Michel crawled languidly around the asymmetrical room, the audience huddled around the perimeter, to a soundscape of intermittent bird song. Ms. P\u00e9trin appeared just as calmly immersed in her task of adorning the ground with origami squares. Three live snakes, delivered from offstage, soon joined in. Humans and reptiles slid over and around one another. This was just the first of many tenuously related, increasingly chaotic episodes, including the arrival of two Chihuahuas (the snakes, not to worry, had exited) and a migration into the adjacent black-box theater for a ritualistic ringing of hand-held bells. A mysterious voice, accompanying a video projection, pronounced, \u201cThis piece will not save us.\u201d Ms. Lacey, cradling a small, three-legged dog while bending and stretching her limbs, told a story about an artist and an institution (Realness, perhaps) trying to spice up their relationship like old lovers. What to do with all this information? I thought of dance as undomesticated wildlife, of the predators and prey involved in buying and selling performance. Down one set of stairs and up another, in a tucked-away dance studio not often used for performances, the choreographer Heather Kravas, visiting from Seattle, offered the New York premiere of \u201cdead, disappears.\u201d Ms. Kravas was her own predator and protector in this stark, self-punishing solo, as she put herself through perilous paces inspired by the sculptor Richard Serra\u2019s \u201cVerb List,\u201d a series of actions that he associated with making his pieces. What seemed at first like arbitrary acts of masochism \u2014 walking on tiptoe with a trash bag over her head while barking two-syllable phrases \u2014 deepened into a formidable exploration of language, the female body and the power play between them. Having duct-taped a pillow to a chair, as if it were a prisoner, Ms. Kravas pounded it with a long pole, shouting a list of alphabetized verbs, one per swipe. By the end, in whatever this struggle had been, she had secured the upper hand. American Realness continues through Jan. 17. Most performances are at Abrons Arts Center, 466 Grand Street, Manhattan; 866-811-4111, americanrealness\u00ad.com.

        "article": "A new European digital privacy law could have serious consequences for online advertising in the region, threatening everyone from ad tech middlemen to publishers to Web giants like Google and Facebook, industry executives say. European Union officials reached agreement Tuesday on the pan-European law, creating a strict new legal framework that dictates how companies can use individuals\u2019 personal information. The law requires approval from the EU Parliament and European governments. The new rules could limit the ability for companies to collect and process online data, a practice on which many business-to-business online advertising companies currently rely. Such companies include Google, Yahoo, Criteo, AOL, Rubicon Project, OpenX and many others. The changes could also impact publishers -- from well-known news providers to smaller ad-supported sites -- who buy services and technologies from online ad vendors to help them deliver targeted ads to their readers and otherwise generate revenues from their audiences. Townsend Feehan, chief executive of the European unit of the Interactive Advertising Bureau, an online advertising trade group, described the new law as \u201ca setback\u201d for Europe\u2019s digital economy. \u201cThere\u2019s not yet a clear understanding of what of the consequences will be, but it could mean there are fewer options for publishers in terms of monetization,\u201d Ms. Feehan said. \u201cThe transition to digital for publishers has already been troubling, so to threaten the business model on which they rely seems counterproductive.\u201d Data-driven advertising now forms the backbone of the $59 billion global online ad industry, and hundreds of companies have emerged in the past 20 years offering various services and technologies related to it. Online data collection allows marketers to target ads to specific types of users, and to measure and analyze the results of their campaigns. The practice also helps publishers generate advertising revenue from their digital audiences. According to Ms. Feehan, her primary concern centers on the concept of user consent as it relates to the collection and processing of data. The new laws could result in companies having to gain more explicit consent from consumers for those practices, which could be difficult for third-party companies which don\u2019t have a direct relationship with consumers. For example, a publisher may not be able to use a third-party advertising network to target ads to a user of its website if that third-party does not have permission from the user to do so. Many publishers now work with dozens of different ad networks and ad tech companies to help them generate revenue from their visitors. \u201cB-to-B companies may have a seriously reduced scope,\u201d Ms. Feehan said, while large platforms operated by companies such as Facebook and Google may find themselves at an advantage since they have a direct relationship with consumers in many instances. Google and Facebook declined to comment. That said, those companies also operate as third-parties in many instances, Ms. Feehan pointed out. They help to sell, target, track and measure ads on properties owned by other companies. \u201cThis is awkward for them, too,\u201d she said. Write to Jack Marshall at Jack.Marshall@wsj.com",

        "article": "Jeremy Lin, the NBA journeyman who has produced three 20-point games for the New York Knicks, and who takes the court Friday against the Los Angeles Lakers, is doing something few athletes have ever done. He's getting Harvard all fired up. New York Knicks sensation Jeremy Lin taking on the Detroit Pistons Lin, a 2010 graduate whose game runs on a mix of sneaky speed, fast-paced ballhandling and a mastery of the pick and roll, is one of only three Harvard players to reach the NBA. He has emerged at a time when the school's men's team is ranked No. 25 in the nation and its games are sold out for the rest of the season. Since Lin cracked the starting lineup Monday, Harvard has seen a surge in media requests for basketball coach Tommy Amaker and a rush to watch clips of Lin on the school's YouTube page. Martin Kessler, co-chair of the Harvard Crimson's sports section, said three of the most-read stories on the paper's web site this week have been about Lin. Since Saturday, Lin's Twitter followers have more than doubled. Ratings for Knicks games on MSG Network have jumped 36% since his first start. And in a Twitter post Thursday, Lin's former employer, Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey, wrote that the team should have kept Lin but had \"no idea\" how good he was. \"He's kind of an overnight sensation and I'm just following his progress,\" said Ryan O'Byrne, a defenseman for the NHL's Colorado Avalanche and a Cornell alumnus. \"It's obviously a pretty compelling story.\" \"I watched SportsCenter, I saw his highlights,\" said Harvard's Matt Birk, who plays center for the Baltimore Ravens. \"I thought, 'Right on!'\" Lin's success, and the strong reaction to it, reinvigorates a debate that's been hanging over the Ivy League for decades: Why does a group of schools that offers its students the best of everything in nearly every field muzzle its ambitions in sports? Jeremy Lin in his Harvard days At several key points in their history, the eight schools now in the Ivy League have pulled away from some of the most competitive circles in college sports. Basketball has suffered under this approach, but football has been the most stunted. In 1981, the Ivy League was excluded from Division I-A, college football's premier classification, when other members voted to restrict membership to schools that had 30,000-seat stadiums or had averaged 17,000 in attendance over the previous four years. The Ivies didn't contest the decision. Derek Bok, Harvard's president at the time, told The Journalin 2009 that it was \"clear that's not where the Ivy should be. \"If we have a bit of humility,\" he added, \"we have to understand that nobody can be excellent at everything.\" Ivy League executive director Robin Harris said Thursday that a move away from the conference's current practices is \"not even in the conversation\u2026 We're comfortable with who we are and our principles.\" Unlike most conferences, the Ivies don't offer conventional athletic scholarships. They don't have a conference basketball tournament and they prohibit football teams from competing in postseason games. In the league's last TV deal, only eight football games in two years were televised. \"Much of the university personnel is very intellectual and rooted in academia and maybe there's not an appreciation for athletics,\" said Craig Breslow, the Arizona Diamondbacks pitcher who went to Yale. \"They may be concerned that it's a slippery slope. You start to promote athletics and you start to have some success and that starts to lead to a blurring of the lines or a compromising of standards.\" The Ivies have had a string of high-profile successes in sports lately. Harvard's basketball team is on track to reach the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 1946. Two members of the Super-Bowl-winning New York Giants went to Ivy League schools and former Yale quarterback Patrick Witt, a transfer from Nebraska, has been invited to the NFL's pre-draft combine later this month. Former Ivy League athletes now in the pro ranks said Thursday they're happy for Lin, and they offered some suggestions about how the league could expand its ambitions in sports, the way top schools like Duke and Stanford have, without endangering its academics. O'Byrne, the former Cornell defenseman, said the Ivy League should start its hockey season earlier. As it stands, O'Byrne said, the shorter season is \"a little limiting, and I think they could extend it a little bit for sure.\" Breslow, the former Yale pitcher, said he thinks there are a lot of good athletes who have the means to pay for an Ivy League education\u2014but they don't choose to attend those schools because, on those campuses, \"athletics don't seem to be a priority.\" Asked about Stanford's success in college football, he said he believes it stems from \"an appreciation for what you bring to the school beyond just the $40,000 scholarship. That definitely weighs on the recruits' minds.\" Cleveland Indians pitcher Frank Herrmann, who went to Harvard, said the school's administrators \"really want to win, but it's not a win-at-all-costs thing. Boosters aren't giving their money because the football team had eight wins.\" Larry Scott, the Pac-12 Conference commissioner, is a former Harvard tennis player. He said he likes the Ivy the way it is, but acknowledged that the Pac-12 has the best example of what the Crimson could do if it adopted a more mainstream approach. \"You'd be wrong to say it wasn't possible,\" Scott said, \"because Stanford's doing it.\" Although the Ivy isn't budging from its sports philosophy, Harris, the league's executive director, said the schools are in \"serious conversations\" about pursuing a multisport TV deal.

        "article": "J immy Carter is a southerner who grew up witnessing Jim Crow segregation in all its forms, so when he told NBC News that he believes \"an overwhelming portion\" of the public animosity directed at President Obama recently is \"based on the fact that he is a black man,\" many Americans listened. But pointing at racism as the chief source of rage is a trap into which liberals have fallen too often, for reasons we'd better face quickly. Racism is only one of many factors driving the backlash against the president in town hall meetings and in demonstrations on Capitol Hill. Obama has been right to discount it, because a white president would feel some scorching heat, too. Just hours before Rep. Joe Wilson's brazen \"You lie!\" interrupted Obama's address to a joint session of Congress, the conservative majority on the Supreme Court welcomed arguments against restricting business-corporate funding of \"Hillary: The Movie\" -- a relic of rage on the presidential primary campaign trail that presaged what Hillary Rodham Clinton would be enduring now were she, not Obama, in the White House. But sexism and racism aren't the only pretexts; recall the swift-boating of Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.) during the 2004 campaign and the unending conservative rage against former president Bill Clinton. Republican House leader John A. Boehner got close to the truth when he told ABC News last spring that people he met at \"taxpayer protests\" are \"scared to death . . . about the future . . . and the facts that the American dream may not be alive for their kids and grandkids.\" Boehner lacks credible answers for these Americans, who are viscerally and legitimately afraid that they'll never again make $28 an hour, afford health insurance or own a home after losing the one they're in. It's the absence of honest answers, more than racism, that's turned out people brandishing signs that liken Obama to Hitler and demanding, with stupefying illogic, that government keep its hands off their Medicare. Are liberals going to deliver the answers the other side does not -- or will they be sidetracked, yet again, by their constant preoccupation with identity politics? Fear and rage that ran far deeper than race were palpable at the 2008 Republican National Convention, where Sen. John McCain -- who, to his credit, refused to trade on racism in his campaign -- found himself coping anyway with a large contingent of young delegates whose repertoire of political expression consisted mainly of shouting \"Yoo Es Ay! Yoo Es Ay! Yoo Es Ay!\" No matter how subtle, subdued or dignified McCain's appeals to patriotism in his acceptance speech, the chorus grew so loud and insistent that at times it seemed an eruption of the GOP's militaristic id, and even the war-hero candidate looked annoyed. Yet it would be a mistake to feel disdain for these guys, for their buffoonish chanting was only one side of them, and not necessarily the dominant one. They haven't curdled into fascists, as some on the left seemed to think. More likely, the thwarted decency in them is trying to find a political home, a sense of civic standing that is slipping away. And now, such individuals are looking for someone or something to blame. With encouragement from Rush Limbaugh and some Republican leaders, they're taking the path of least resistance and blaming an easy mark -- a government they can vote out of office, a leader who looks unfamiliar -- rather than the immense, private bureaucracies they're beholden to, can't touch at the polls and will find even harder to resist if John Roberts's Supreme Court voids restrictions on corporate \"free speech\" in campaigns. Some of them listen to Limbaugh while commuting to work or driving anxiously from one job interview to another, and they recycle his wisdom as their own at the bar, the family dinner table or the diner in western Massachusetts where I sometimes have breakfast. Racism, sexism, Islam, \"big government\" -- anything will serve, if it spares them having to face being had by the unaccountable powers and riptides that are destroying their dreams. Wilson's \"conduct was asinine, but I think it would be asinine no matter what the color of the president,\" said Dick Harpootlian, who, far from being Wilson's apologist, is the former chairman of the South Carolina Democratic Party. Condemning racism in this context, as President Carter and many well-meaning liberals do, won't deflect the demagoguery and folly that foreclose bold new strategies in the provision and regulation of capital, health care, energy and defense. The mistake of crying racism is especially tempting to upscale, influential liberals who, no less than protesters on the right, are ducking the true causes of dispossession, fear and rage: the premises and practices of financial capital, predatory consumer marketing and a national-security state boondoggling. Liberals who've done well by those practices aren't always serious about redressing their inequities and disruptions. But they can't bring themselves to defend them very wholeheartedly, either. So they grasp at symbolic gestures against racism that short-circuit political currents for necessary change as surely as Rush does. Remember the moralistic passion plays over the dubious black church \"arson epidemic\"? Or the supposed \"ethnic cleansing\" in congressional redistricting in which black incumbents actually won in majority-white districts? That politics of \"anti-racist\" paroxysm eclipsed the real challenges, which have only worsened since then. Carter is hardly wrong to condemn racism when he sees it in the protests. But to blame racism for an \"overwhelming portion\" of the fear and rage rising around us would be to consign legitimately frightened and angry people to demagogues and shut out real change. That would be a strategic blunder, and ultimately a moral one, too.

        "article": "Ah, the joys of baseball\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trading deadline. No, it is not very dramatic and is painfully lacking in team executives acting like game show contestants (see: N.H.L. and N.B.A. trade deadlines), and as we know, it is not actually a deadline. Trades made before 4 p.m. Eastern time do not require a trip through waivers. We get another month until the waiver trade deadline. And then after that, teams have to have a note from Mom. We all know how complicated that can be. So these are the season\u00e2\u0080\u0099s uncomplicated days. That is unless you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re factoring in how the wave of impending drug suspensions is mucking all this up. That doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to be the case with the Red Sox snagging pitcher Jake Peavy from the White Sox, which seems purely motivated by the Red Sox\u00e2\u0080\u0099 desperation to avoid flirting with the wild-card game, as Jeff Passan writes on Yahoo.com, with the Rays suddenly looking like fierce rivals for the American League East title. Peavy, then, seems like a no-brainer. He has won a Cy Young and pitching\u00e2\u0080\u0099s triple crown. Unfortunately, that was in 2007 and now he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 32 and has a pedestrian 4.28 earned run average. Playing for the currently moribund White Sox, however, has something to do with that and as it turns out, Peavy comes with some added skills. He plays well on the Web, both as part of a scientific experiment (wait until you see what peanut butter does to a fastball) and as a guitar player. Forget five-tool players, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s got tools, instruments and a well-stocked pantry. Feel free to hum along with him here. And best of all, Peavy has never been caught on video celebrating a victory like Miami\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Chad Qualls after polishing off the Mets on Tuesday night. At least, as the announcers say, Qualls stuck the landing. Qualls' overexcitement leads to a tumble The Rays\u00e2\u0080\u0099 relief pitchers don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a lot to brag about in this moment captured on video, when a hard liner scatters them like scared birds while the ball boy calmly makes the catch. Ballboy makes catch, Rays' bullpen runs away But hey, the Rays\u00e2\u0080\u0099 pitchers can all take solace in the fact that they are not Alex Rodriguez. The Yankees\u00e2\u0080\u0099 pariah isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t much of a video star these days, at least until, as expected, baseball drops a suspension on him and the expected legal histrionics begin. That should totally help his reputation. When you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got Roger Clemens stepping up to give you a vote of confidence, well, you know things have sunk to historically low levels. The N.F.L., you may have noticed, does not have these problems. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because it has an almost cosmetic drug-testing program, which players like Denver\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Von Miller still reportedly manage to fail, but not because the league is actually trying very hard. No, the N.F.L.'s most visible issue at the moment is players dropping like arcade ducks in training camp. Receiver Percy Harvin, Seattle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s free agency coup, is the latest, announcing he needs hip surgery. The most surprising part of this is that, if you watch Harvin highlights, almost no one manages to hit him. There is a push to make N.F.L. training camps seem like fun, as opposed to a series of medical emergencies. To this end, we have the helmet-cam, this one worn by the Vikings\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Adrian Peterson, which is brave considering how recently Peterson was being carted off with a knee injury. So far in this one, he shows mainly how hard it is to see out the front of a helmet. Adrian Peterson Helmet Cam + Wired For Sound At least Adrian Peterson won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get traded in a fit of deal-making frenzy. The N.F.L. has an even lamer trade season than baseball.

        "article": "For Donald Trump to win the White House in November, he\u2019ll need the votes of women like Elizabeth Andrus. Yet Andrus, a registered Republican from Delaware, Ohio, sees \u201cbuffoonery\u201d in the presumptive Republican nominee and says \u201cI am not on the Trump train.\u201d With all the trouble in the world, she went on, \u201cyou just don\u2019t want Donald Trump as president.\u201d Her negative impression of Trump was shared by most of the dozens of white, suburban women from politically important states who were interviewed by The Associated Press this spring. Their views are reflected in opinion polls, such as a recent AP-GfK survey that found 70% of women have unfavorable opinions of Trump. Democrat Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign sees that staggering figure as a tantalizing general election opening. While white voters continue to abandon the Democratic Party, small gains with white women could help put likely nominee Clinton over the top if the November election is close. Democrats believe these women could open up opportunities for Clinton in North Carolina, where President Barack Obama struggled with white voters in his narrow loss in the state 2012, and even in Georgia, a Republican stronghold that Democrats hope to make competitive. Patty Funderburg of Charlotte, North Carolina, voted for Republican Mitt Romney in 2012, but says she\u2019s already convinced that Trump won\u2019t get her vote. \u201cHe\u2019s not who I\u2019d want to represent our country,\u201d said Funderburg, a 54-year-old mother of three. Trump insists he\u2019s \u201cgoing to do great with women.\u201d He\u2019s accused Clinton of playing the \u201cwoman\u2019s card\u201d in her bid to become the first female commander in chief. He\u2019s said he will link her aggressively to past indiscretions with women by her husband, former President Bill Clinton. The businessman also has previewed an argument focused on national security, with echoes of the pitch that President George W. Bush successfully made to white suburban women during his 2004 re-election. \u201cWomen want, above all else, they want security,\u201d Trump told The Associated Press recently. \u201cThey want to have a strong military, they want to have strong borders. They don\u2019t want crime.\u201d He said \u201cHillary is viewed poorly on that.\u201d Not so in the AP-GfK poll. About 40% of women surveyed said Clinton would be best at protecting the country and handling the threat posed by the Islamic State group, and about 30% said Trump. Throughout the primary, Clinton has talked about policies meant to appeal to women: equal pay, expanded child care, paid family, and medical leave and more. And Trump has his own complicated past regarding women and has faced criticism for his actions both in his personal life and at his businesses toward them. He\u2019s vigorously defended his treatment of women, as has his daughter Ivanka Trump, who said her father \u201chas total respect for women.\u201d A super political action committee backing Clinton has released its first television advertisements featuring Trump\u2019s contentious statements about women. \u201cDoes Donald Trump really speak for you?\u201d the super PAC ad asks. For many of the women interviewed, the answer appears to be no. Andrus, a Republican who nevertheless voted twice for Obama, praised Trump\u2019s political skills and argued his business career indicates an intellect and ability that could benefit the nation. But his temperament, she said, is somewhere between \u201cbuffoonery\u201d and \u201ccomplete narcissism.\u201d \u201cIt would be like having Putin for president,\u201d she added, referring to Russia\u2019s sometimes belligerent president, Vladimir Putin. Erin Freedman, a 38-year-old from Reston, Virginia, said Trump scares her. While she\u2019s an enthusiastic backer of Clinton\u2019s primary rival, Bernie Sanders, she said she\u2019d have no problem backing the former secretary of state against Trump in a general election. Even some reluctant Trump supporters say they want him to dial back the braggadocio and caustic insults, and engage people more seriously. \u201cHe\u2019s the nominee, so I\u2019ll vote for him,\u201d said Renee Herman, a 45-year-old from Sunbury, Ohio, who preferred retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and her home-state governor, John Kasich, in the GOP primary field. \u201cBut it\u2019s time we get past all this showmanship and hear from him what he actually wants to do and his plans for how to do it.\u201d Trump\u2019s best opening is that Clinton, who is on the cusp of clinching her party\u2019s nomination, would enter the November race with a majority of Americans taking a dim view of her candidacy. Fifty-five percent have a negative view of Clinton, including 53 percent of women, in the AP-GfK poll. \u201cAnybody but Hillary,\u201d said Carolyn Owen, a 64-year-old educator from Clayton, North Carolina, near Raleigh. She said Trump wasn\u2019t her first choice, \u201cbut it\u2019s better than the alternative.\u201d While Obama won the support of women overall in his two White House campaigns, white women have increasingly been shifting toward the Republican Party in recent elections. Obama only won 42% of white women in 2012. Romney won 56% of white women, more than Bush and the party\u2019s 2008 nominee, Sen. John McCain. Clinton\u2019s hopes will largely hinge on replicating Obama\u2019s coalition of blacks, Hispanics and young people. In both of his elections, Obama earned near-unanimous support from black women, while drawing the votes of roughly 7 in 10 Hispanic women. But she would have more room for error with those groups if she can increase Democrats\u2019 share of white women. Another potentially favorable scenario for Clinton involves Republican and independent women who can\u2019t stomach a vote for Trump but also don\u2019t want to vote for a Democrat. Maybe they simply stay home, keeping the GOP nominee\u2019s vote totals down. For Angee Stephens of Indianola, Iowa, that seems to be the only option at this point. She\u2019s wary of Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state, which is the subject of an FBI investigation, and her past political decisions. But \u201cTrump sort of scares me,\u201d Stephens said. In Georgia, Trump supporter Sue Everhart said she talks regularly with suburban Republican women struggling with whether to vote for Trump, and said some cite his boorishness. The former state party chairwoman said she tries to bring the conversation back to Clinton and remind Republicans \u201cwho we are running against.\u201d As for Trump\u2019s penchant for controversial statements about women, Everhart said, \u201cI learned a long time ago that most any man over 50 in this party, they like you as long as you\u2019re making the cookies.\u201d \u201cI should probably be offended,\u201d she added. \u201cBut I\u2019m not.\u201d",

        "article": "One year after Sri Lanka\u2019s president, Mahinda Rajapaksa, declared victory and hailed his military for ending a decades-long separatist rebellion by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, a British news organization aired new accusations that the country\u2019s soldiers committed war crimes during the war\u2019s final months. On Tuesday, Britain\u2019s Channel 4 News presented what it said was testimony from two former members of Sri Lanka\u2019s military who claim that the government ordered the execution of Tamil prisoners captured at the end of a separatist rebellion last year. The two men, both said to be in hiding, were granted anonymity by Channel 4 News. While The Lede has not been able to independently verify the accusations made by the men \u2014 one a former commander, the other a front-line soldier \u2014 Channel 4 News has produced credible reports on apparent human rights violations in Sri Lanka in the past. Amateur video obtained by Channel 4\u2019s Jonathan Miller last year \u2014 which showed, according to the exiled Sri Lankan journalists who smuggled it out of the country, the execution of Tamil prisoners by government forces \u2014 was later deemed authentic by a panel of experts who studied the footage for the United Nations. Mr. Miller\u2019s new report, embedded below, also contains what he says are photographs taken by Sri Lankan soldiers last year of captured Tamil men and boys, including one image of the dead body of the leader of the Tamil Tigers. (Be advised: the video report below contains distressing images.) The man identified in Mr. Miller\u2019s report as a soldier who served on the front line against the Tamil Tigers said that when members of the rebel force surrendered with their families, \u201cour commander ordered us to kill everyone.\u201d Among those executed after surrendering was the 13-year-old son of the rebel leader, according to the man identified as a senior commander in the report. The High Commission for Sri Lanka in London issued a statement denouncing the report, which was published on the Web site of Channel 4 News. The statement said, in part: The High Commission of Sri Lanka in the United Kingdom totally deny the allegations made against the Government of Sri Lanka and its armed forces. As it has been repeatedly stressed and supported by evidence, Government\u2019s security forces were engaged in a humanitarian operation with the objective of rescuing the civilians held as human shields by a terrorist outfit. [...] The President of Sri Lanka has established the \u201cLessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission\u201d of eight eminent persons reflecting all ethnic groups in Sri Lanka to inquire and report institutional administrative and legislative measures which need to be taken in order to prevent any recurrence of such concerns in the future, and to promote further national unity and reconciliation among all communities. The Sri Lankan government insists that the presidential commission is sufficient to look into all accusations of atrocities that may have been committed by both sides during the war, but human rights groups and the United Nations have called for an independent inquiry. As my colleague Lydia Polgreen wrote on Sunday, a new report by the International Crisis Group released on Monday, \u201cwhich cites witness testimony, satellite images, documents and other evidence, calls for a wide-reaching international investigation into what it calls atrocities committed in the last months of the Sri Lankan government\u2019s war against the Tamil Tiger insurgency.\u201d The International Crisis Group\u2019s president, Louise Arbour, who is a former chief prosecutor for the International Criminal Tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and for Rwanda, explained to Channel 4 News why \u201ca credible, fair, independent, international investigation,\u201d is necessary because \u201cSri Lanka has a very long history of impunity and any national initiative in Sri Lanka would be bound to fail and certainly would carry no credibility.\u201d Following Ms. Arbour\u2019s appearance, Palitha Kohona, the Sri Lankan ambassador to the U.N., disagreed sharply with her assessment that the presidential commission would not give a credible account of atrocities carried out by both its own forces and the Tamil separatists. Mr. Kohona said, \u201cSri Lanka has a history of a very highly respected judicial system and I have no doubt that this commission of inquiry will conduct its inquiries in a satisfactory manner \u2014 and to suggest that anybody from outside can do a better job, I think is simply colonialist. That era is gone now.\u201d",

        "article": "Andy, a 32-year-old IT consultant, is used to people laughing at him when he tries to explain his crippling fear of buttons, specifically those on shirts and jackets. \u201cI\u2019ve worked in corporate environments, full of people in suits, and there are buttons everywhere you look. This situation is to me what other people may feel being locked in a burning building, or drowning and not be able to swim to the surface,\u201d he says, his voice audibly shaking at the mere thought of rooms full of shirt buttons. Andy\u2019s condition is called koumpounophobia. It is not as common as some phobias \u2013 but still affects around one in every 75,000 people. Sufferers report losing contact with family and friends because they are unable to attend weddings and funerals, or abandoning their careers and doing jobs that allow for remote working or casual clothing. Phobias are irrational fears which are classified as either simple \u2013 of a particular object, such as in Andy\u2019s case \u2013 or complex, when they pertain to a circumstance or situation. Because of the ridicule sufferers are often met with, people tend to suffer in silence and phobias go untreated. \u201cI thought I\u2019d be laughed out of a GP\u2019s office,\u201d says Andy. \u201cI knew this was a real thing, but didn\u2019t know how to explain it without feeling like an idiot.\u201d Another reason many people don\u2019t seek help is because of what the treatment entails. The NHS offers cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) to people with phobias, which includes \u201cexposure\u201d to the object of the fear. A person develops a phobia when their brain has learned to respond to certain non-dangerous situations (such as seeing a small spider) with a \u201cfight-or-flight\u201d response, which causes symptoms that include panic attacks, palpitations, hysterical crying, and the urge to run. Exposure can work because if patients slowly learn to respond to seeing, say, a spider in a calm way \u2013 eventually even holding one in their hands \u2013 they can essentially \u201crewire\u201d their brains. But the thought of facing a phobia in such a way can, understandably, be terrifying. Around 10 million people in the UK suffer from phobias, yet research into causes and treatments is incredibly limited compared with other mental health conditions. Nicky Lidbetter, chief executive of Anxiety UK, has herself suffered from phobias and is a keen supporter of CBT treatment, but argues it needs to be improved and that further research is crucial. \u201cI remember when anxiety used to be bundled in with depression, despite being a very different condition. We worked hard to raise the profile of anxiety as a separate disorder that could be just as crippling. This is what we need to do with phobias,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause they often seem comical and irrational, the media doesn\u2019t take them seriously and I think this mentality has seeped into the medical world, which is why there\u2019s so little funding and research.\u201d Amy is a 25-year-old marketing manager based in Leeds. She says: \u201cI knew that if I told a doctor I was scared of heights they\u2019d make me go on a rollercoaster or something. Just seeing a long flight of stairs was making my heart race. I\u2019d start to shake, and couldn\u2019t stop myself from running away.\u201d Amy eventually sought help when she and her boyfriend were looking to move in together and it became too limiting to find a ground-floor or basement flat. Her treatment involved various exercises, such going up in a lift every day and getting off one floor higher each week. She is now able to manage her phobia, although it hasn\u2019t disappeared. CBT and exposure therapy has been proven effective in a lot of cases, but some experts disagree with the way it is applied across-the-board to all patients. Guy Baglow is the director of Mindspa Phobia Clinic in Harley Street, London. \u201cCBT is about correcting thinking patterns, and it works really well for a lot of conditions, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s effective in treating phobias,\u201d he says. \u201cWe deal with a lot of clients who have had exposure therapy, and it has actually reinforced the patterns we want to break. CBT tackles the conscious mind, trying to teach us to reason against our phobias, but most people know their phobias are irrational to begin with, so this doesn\u2019t feel helpful.\u201d Despite being overwhelmed at the prospect of exposure, Andy did eventually see his GP, who referred him to a counsellor. \u201cShe was really friendly but I had to wait a month for a half-hour phone consultation, and then all I was going to have was one 45-minute session every two weeks. By this point I was too terrified to leave the house.\u201d Even at home, Andy was in a constant state of alert. TV and movies were impossible, in case a close-up of a button appeared onscreen. He needed urgent help. \u201cI moved back in with my parents and spent hundreds of pounds on intensive private therapy, but after a couple of sessions they tried to make me look at some pictures of shirts, and I started panicking. I couldn\u2019t get the image out of my head for weeks and it made me constantly terrified. I couldn\u2019t go back.\u201d More recently, though, life has become a little easier, and he recently bought his first ever pair of button-fly jeans. \u201cI\u2019m so lucky to have had the support system I do, because without my family I really think I might have considered taking my own life,\u201d he says. \u201cLooking back, it\u2019s so tragic to realise that while my friends were joking about my weird little quirk and playing pranks on me, on the inside I was battling my own brain every minute of every day. It was so exhausting and stressful, I can\u2019t imagine anyone would find it funny if they knew what it was really like.\u201d",

        "article": "A California mom says her public school administrators violated her daughter's First Amendment rights when they ordered the seventh-grader to take off her pro-life T-shirt. Anna Amador has gone to court on behalf of her daughter, who she says was ordered by her principal to change her shirt on \"National Pro-Life T-Shirt Day.\" The shirt the girl was wearing displays two graphic pictures of a fetus growing in the womb. The incident occurred in April 2008 at McSwain Elementary School, a K-8 school in Merced, Calif. Amador alleges in her legal complaint that school Principal Terrie Rohrer, Assistant Principal C.W. Smith and office clerk Martha Hernandez mistreated her daughter and denied the girl her First Amendment rights when they ordered her to leave the cafeteria and change her shirt. \"Before Plaintiff could eat [breakfast] she was ordered by a school staff member to throw her food out and report immediately to Defendant Smith's office, located in the main office of McSwain Elementary School,\" the complaint reads. \"Upon arriving at the main office, Defendant Hernandez, intentionally and without Plaintiff's consent, grabbed Plaintiff's arm and forcibly escorted her toward Smith's office, at all times maintaining a vice-like grip on Plaintiff's arm. Hernandez only released Plaintiff's arm after physically locating her in front of Smith and Defendant Rohrer... \"Smith and Rohrer ordered Plaintiff to remove her pro-life T-shirt and instructed Plaintiff to never wear her pro-life T-shirt at McSwain Elementary School ever again... \"Completely humiliated and held out for ridicule, Plaintiff complied with Defendants' directives and removed her pro-life T-shirt, whereupon, Defendants seized and confiscated it. Defendants did not return Plaintiff's property until the end of the school day.\" The school administrators dispute some of the allegations, said Anthony N. DeMaria, attorney for the McSwain Union Elementary School District. \"I think the school district has a very strong defense,\" DeMaria said. \"The complaint does not properly characterize the events that happened. Certainly we dispute some of the events.\" He said he was unable to reach the administrators to determine which parts they say are incorrect, because school is out for the summer. Rohrer, the principal, told FOXNews.com on Monday that she could not issue a statement without consulting with the school superintendent and their attorney. The other defendants and school district employees did not respond to calls and e-mails from FOXNews.com. The school district sought to get the case thrown out due to \"failure to state a cognizable claim,\" but a U.S. Eastern District Court judge ruled last month that all but one of Amador's claims could go forward. The complaint quotes school district officials saying that they ordered Amador's daughter to remove the shirt because it constituted \"inappropriate subject matter\" in violation of the school's dress code, which bans clothing with \"suggestion of tobacco, drug or alcohol use, sexual promiscuity, profanity, vulgarity, or other inappropriate subject matter.\" Amador claims in the legal complaint that other students at the school have been allowed to wear expressive shirts, and she blames the school for \u201cinconsistently applying their Dress Code based upon subjective determinations as to which messages are acceptable and which messages are not.\u201d One of the girl's lawyers, Mark A. Thiel, said that the images on her shirt of a fetus in the womb were same as those in her science textbooks. He said no student had complained about the shirt, and he said the girl's parents were not called when the incident took place. \"This was a young girl, not even in high school. But they didn't call,\" he said. A spokeswoman for the local Planned Parenthood chapter declined to take sides in the case. \"Even offensive speech is protected as long as it doesn\u2019t impinge upon the rights of others,\" said Deborah Ortiz, vice president of public affairs for Planned Parenthood Mar Monte. \"School administrators have a mission to educate, and the student\u2019s right to political speech should be protected in balance with this education mission.\" UCLA law professor and First Amendment expert Eugene Volokh said Supreme Court precedent appears to support the girl's case. \"During the Vietnam War, the Supreme Court ruled that wearing black arm bands [at school, to protest the war] was OK,\u201d Volokh said. \u201cIf students can wear armbands in protest, why can't they wear a pro-life shirt?\" He said the case would be different if there was evidence that the shirt could have led to disruption or fighting. \"Schools have a lot more authority than the government does in regulating speech,\u201d he said. \u201cIf someone is speaking on a street corner and it looks like other people are going to start a fight over it, the government's job is to protect the speaker. That is not the case in schools. We need to make sure students learn. So if speech is highly disruptive, well \u2026 in that case we can suppress it. \"But the school's position that they can restrict speech just because they find it inappropriate is not correct.\" But the fact that it's a K-8 school with very young children could change things, said Brooklyn Law School professor William Araiza. He pointed to the 2007 Supreme Court decision in Morse v. Frederick, where the court allowed a high school to suspend students in Juneau, Alaska, who waved a banner that read \u201cBong hits 4 Jesus\u201d from across the street during an Olympic torch relay, because it was seen as promoting illegal drug use. \u201c[The school] could almost use a \u201cbong hits\u201d kind of rationale about protecting students from inappropriate messages,\u201d Araiza said. \u201cFor instance, would you allow a 4th grader to wear a gruesome picture of a bomb scene? You probably wouldn't.\u201d First Amendment attorney William Becker, who represents Amador, disagreed that the shirt could be seen as containing inappropriate messages. \"The message of the T-shirt is that life is sacred,\" he said. \"One would be very hard pressed to find anything wrong with that particular idea, except that some people do object to the political message.\u201d",

        "article": "By Doyle Rice, USA TODAY Tropical Storm Danielle formed Sunday afternoon in the far eastern Atlantic, the fourth named storm of the 2010 season, according to the National Hurricane Center. Monday morning, the storm's sustained winds were 65 mph. It was about 2,700 miles southeast of Miami and was heading west-northwest at about 16 mph. The hurricane center predicted that Danielle will become the Atlantic's second hurricane of the season by late Tuesday. Its potential effect on the USA is uncertain, although the latest forecast is for the storm to curve out to sea later this week. Regardless of what Danielle does, the Atlantic hurricane season, which includes the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, is entering the traditional peak period in what is predicted to be a very active year for tropical storms and hurricanes. \"There are signs that the Atlantic is acting like it should in August and September,\" says Rick Knabb, a meteorologist and tropical program manager at the Weather Channel. \"We're seeing more activity than we did earlier in the season.\" Danielle could be the start of what AccuWeather hurricane expert Joe Bastardi calls \"an upcoming frenzy of storms, days with two or three storms on the chart.\" Knabb says tropical waves are starting to move from Africa into the Atlantic with more regularity. \"Tropical waves are the seedlings for the hurricanes that move across the Atlantic,\" he says. In a typical year, about 60-70 tropical waves form off the West African coast, but only a small fraction become hurricanes, reports Dennis Feltgen, a meteorologist for the hurricane center. This is the prime time of year for storms to develop from those waves because of the warm ocean water and absence of strong wind shear that can shred even the strongest hurricane. Most major hurricanes that have struck the USA have come after mid-August, Knabb says. Officials in Florida, the most hurricane-prone state in the nation, stress preparedness. \"It only takes one storm to cause a loss of lives and devastating property damage,\" says Lauren McKeague of the Florida Division of Emergency Management. Before Sunday, there had been three named storms: Hurricane Alex and tropical storms Bonnie and Colin. Alex lashed the southern Texas and northeastern Mexican coasts in June. Predictions by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration are for 14 to 20 named storms in the Atlantic, of which eight to 12 would become hurricanes. In a typical season, 10 tropical storms form, of which six become hurricanes. AccuWeather says the main reasons for the active season include warm weather along the East Coast, a La Ni\u00f1a trend that is producing weaker winds in the upper atmosphere and warm water temperatures in the tropics. Meanwhile, in the Pacific Ocean, Tropical Storm Frank is developing off Mexico, the Associated Press reported. The National Hurricane Center said the storm had maximum sustained winds of 60 mph. Mexico issued a tropical storm warning for the coast from Puerto Angel to Tecpan de Galeana. You share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

        "article": "Most of us put a good deal of thought into the food we put in our bodies. But do we ever consider the food in our medicine? That's right, the food in our medicine. While television and print ads alike are loaded with messages about potential serious side effects, prescription drug disclaimers are issued to warn against possible unintended consequences resulting from a drug\u2019s active ingredient(s). But what you may not know is that the bulk of your prescription pill is made up of inactive ingredients, known as \u201cexcipients,\" and that your drugs couldn\u2019t be made without them. Quite simply, excipients are what encapsulates your capsule or forms your pill into a solid as opposed to a powder. Here\u2019s the rub: One of the most common excipients used is gelatin, which is almost universally of animal origin. This presents a problem, as you might imagine, to those living within religious or dietary restrictions. According to a new study released Monday in the BMJ Postgraduate Medical Journal, 43.2% of the study population \u201cwould prefer not to take animal product-containing medication, even if no alternative were available.\u201d 500 people participated in the study. Of the study participants with dietary restrictions, 88% said they would prefer to take oral medication containing only vegetable products. Of the patients who preferred vegetarian-only treatment, 85.2% said they would not take any oral medication which contained animal products, though more than half said they would do so if no alternatives were available. Perhaps most surprising, less than a quarter of those patients with dietary restrictions specifically asked the doctor who prescribed the drug or the pharmacist who dispensed it about its composition. Previous studies have shown that doctors do not regularly discuss a medication's inactive ingredients with their patients, and very few patients think to ask. Of the participants who were surveyed, those who followed a Halal diet and those who designated themselves as pure vegetarian/vegan were far more like to ask about a drug\u2019s constituents than those who avoided only certain animal foods, such as chicken, beef, or pork. The data from the study shows that the majority of the people who were surveyed found it completely acceptable that their medications contained gelatin, an animal by-product. But if it's important for you to know and to control exactly what food is entering your body, the takeaway here is simple: ask your doctor - or your pharmacist.

        "article": "Fifteen years after the debut of Gilmore Girls, creator Amy Sherman-Palladino knows she captured lightning in a bottle. \u201cToday, you don\u2019t sell Gilmore Girls,\u201d Sherman-Palladino said during Saturday\u2019s ATX Festival panel, moderated by EW\u2019s own Danielle Nussbaum. \u201cNobody would buy it. It wouldn\u2019t happen.\u201d Gilmore Girls, which debuted in 2000, starred Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel as the fast-talking dynamic duo of the title, Lorelei and Rory Gilmore. The key to bringing the show to life in that era was timing. \u201cThey kind of just left us alone, which also never happens anymore,\u201d said Sherman-Palladino, who is currently writing the book to an original musical as well as a pilot for Amazon. \u201cWe ran wild like crazy meth kids around the WB lot, inventing things.\u201d Here are some of the highlights from the panel: On Gilmore Girls standing the test of time: \u201cAs a writer, you expect to be fired before it gets on the air,\u201d Sherman-Palladino said, noting they were up against tough competition in Friends and Survivor when they launched before being moved against American Idol. Still, years later\u2014especially now that the show is on Netflix\u2014there\u2019s a whole new generation of Gilmore Girls viewers. \u201cNow there are 20 year olds coming up to me, \u2018You\u2019re so young and full of hope. Why?\u2019\u201d On Gilmore Girls\u2019 pop culture references: While new viewers may not understand some of the older pop culture references, the writers tried not to alienate viewers. \u201cI wanted it to be something everyone would enjoy,\u201d she said. If Gilmore existed now, however, Sherman-Palladino said she would\u2019ve loved to riff on Amanda Bynes. On filming Gilmore Girls: \u201cIt started with the necessity of not being in Toronto,\u201d Sherman-Palladino said, recalling moving the show to the WB backlot, where she envisioned a \u201cwarm and candy-colored\u201d Stars Hollow. \u201cYou want that feeling of warmth.\u201d On the speed of Gilmore Girls: While the network never asked Sherman-Palladino to slow the dialogue down, the creator did learn the hard way that her scripts needed to be longer. \u201cBecause we were so fast, our page count was very long,\u201d she said. \u201cOn Gilmore, I turned in a pilot that was like 60-something pages. I knew I needed to get it down to 50, but I was just feeling internally that this was right. We shot it and we were 15 minutes short. Legally you cannot put the program on when it\u2019s that short. We had to shoot four extra scenes.\u201d As she explained to the network, \u201cThe way it\u2019s written, if you say this stuff slow, it\u2019s going to blow.\u201d On casting funny gal Melissa McCarthy on Gilmore Girls: \u201cTo get Melissa, I had to fight,\u201d she said. \u201cShe had a different energy. The part was written for a woman, there was no body type. They just weren\u2019t sure. It was a tricky sell. It took a while. Everybody came around. It just took a few shows. She is different and different is sometimes not the easiest thing to embrace, but that\u2019s true of life. If we want people to embrace more Melissa McCarthys and more complicated parts\u2026 we have to keep writing the parts, fighting the fights and be willing to be fired to say, \u2018Mr. Person with Money, you\u2019re wrong.\u2019\u201d On the end of Gilmore Girls: \u201cAll good things must die,\u201d she said. \u201cThe last season was the last season. Shit happens. We left it in the hands of our writers. We had good, smart, strong writers who had trained with us. We felt like if we can\u2019t be there, at least it\u2019s in the hands of people who would honor the spirit of what we set up. It\u2019s always a bummer when you don\u2019t get to end it. I hoped there would be a call, \u2018Hey, it\u2019s the last episode, do you want to come back?\u2019 But there wasn\u2019t. I\u2019m so incredibly amazed at what we got to do. The legacy is there. I\u2019m still on speaking terms with the entire cast. When does that happen?\u201d This article originally appeared on EW.com",

        "article": "When it\u2019s time to protect our skin from the sun, we usually work from the outside in: diligently applying (and reapplying) sunscreen, donning our cover-ups, and creating our own shady oasis beneath wide-brimmed hats. But what if we could get that same effective protection from the inside out? That question is at the center of two new studies published in The Journal of Photochemistry and Photobiology and The Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology. The first study tested citrus extract, rosemary extract, and a combination of both extracts in skin cells and in 10 human volunteers. After 85 days of treatment, the combined supplements increased the amount of UV exposure needed to cause sunburn by 56 percent. In the second, a group of 20 volunteers took a blood orange supplement and saw protective effects after only 15 days. By the end of the study, researchers concluded that the supplement reduced the risk of sunburn by 40 percent. Most impressively, patients were asked to avoid wearing sunscreen during testing, meaning the skin-saving results appear to be the work of the supplements alone. MORE: 5 Best Vitamins For Beautiful Skin What is it about these particular plants that make them so effective? In a word: antioxidants. Environmental stressors like UV radiation cause our cells to churn out free radicals--highly reactive molecules with an imbalance of electrons. These wayward particles tear through the body as they try to regain molecular harmony, damaging cells, DNA, and proteins along the way. Antioxidants--like the ones found in citrus and rosemary--neutralize free radicals and halt the kind of damage that can cause premature aging and skin cancer. These studies add to a growing body of research suggesting that the antioxidants we eat can have a profound effect on our outermost layer. (If you're still skipping on sunscreen, you better think again. Here are the Sunscreen Excuses Even Smart Women Make.) The specific supplements used in these studies are not available for purchase in the U.S., but until they're proven to work in larger groups of patients, that\u2019s probably a good thing. \u201cThese are small studies that help reinforce what we commonly advise our patients: Oral antioxidants help minimize UV damage to the skin,\u201d said Dr. Joshua Zeichner, director of cosmetic research at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City. He stresses that more research needs to be done before he'd recommend such supplements to his patients. While we wait, Zeichner said, we can prevent damage with a combination of smart eating, protective clothing, and, of course, good old sunscreen. \"In general I recommend a balanced diet, with plenty of brightly colored fruits and vegetables, which are rich in antioxidants,\" he advised. And, most importantly, \u201cMake sunscreen a part of your daily regimen, just like brushing your teeth.\" It\u2019s not quite as easy as swallowing a supplement, but hey--we\u2019ll gladly spend the interim rocking some glamorous (and protective!) hats and shades.

        "article": "A mass bleaching event on the Great Barrier Reef this year killed more coral than ever before, scientists have revealed. Last month, researchers said the wonder of nature was \u201cdead\u201d : today they have found the murder weapon. The 1,400-mile long reef - the world's biggest - suffered its most severe bleaching in recorded history due to warming sea temperatures during March and April, with the northern third bearing the brunt. Underwater surveys revealed a 700-kilometre stretch of reefs in the less-accessible north lost two-thirds of shallow-water corals in just nine months. \"Most of the losses in 2016 have occurred in the northern, most-pristine part of the Great Barrier Reef,\" said Terry Hughes, head of the Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies at James Cook University. \"This region escaped with minor damage in two earlier bleaching events in 1998 and 2002, but this time around it has been badly affected.\" Further south over the vast central and southern regions, including major tourist areas around Cairns and the Whitsunday Islands, there was a much lower toll. Bleaching occurs when abnormal environmental conditions, such as warmer sea temperatures, cause corals to expel tiny photosynthetic algae, draining them of their colour. Algae are vital to the coral, which uses the organic products of photosynthesis to help it grow. The loss of algae makes the host vulnerable to disease and means it will eventually die. However, coral can recover if the water temperature drops and the algae are able to recolonise them. Environmentalists blame the burning of fossil fuels for global warming and repeated calls Tuesday for Australia to abandon coal mining to help prevent further bleaching disasters. \"This is the devastating price we are paying for the Australian government propping up the coal industry,\" said Greenpeace Australia reef campaigner Shani Tager. \"A credible plan to protect the reef must address climate change and start with a ban on new coal mines.\" Canberra insists it is doing more than ever to safeguard the reef, which is also under pressure from farming run-off, development and the coral-eating crown-of-thorns starfish, committing more than Aus$2.0 billion (US$1.50 billion) over the next decade. Scientists estimate the northern region, which teems with marine life, will take at least 10-15 years to regain lost corals, but are concerned that a fourth major bleaching event may occur before that, hampering the recovery. The reef studies centre warned earlier this year that if greenhouse gas levels keep rising, similar events would be the new normal, occurring every two years by the mid-2030s. Given reefs need so long to recover from severe bleaching, it said \"we are likely to lose large parts of the Great Barrier Reef in just a couple of decades\". That study noted climate change had added 1.0 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming to ocean temperatures off the Queensland coast in March, when corals were first seen turning white. There had been fears that the bleaching would badly hurt the tourism industry but Andrew Baird, who led teams of divers to re-survey the reefs in October and November, said the more accessible parts had not suffered as badly. \"The good news is the southern two-thirds of the reef has escaped with minor damage,\" he said. \"On average, six percent of bleached corals died in the central region in 2016, and only one percent in the south. The corals have now regained their vibrant colour, and these reefs are in good condition.\" Tourism on the World Heritage-listed reef employs 70,000 people and generates Aus$5 billion in income each year. Australia last year narrowly avoided UNESCO putting the site on its endangered list and must report to the World Heritage committee by December 1 on the progress being made to rescue the reef.

The performance was for an enactment of \u201cJack and the Beanstalk,\u201d which took place in her Nashville home as she was putting her 4-year-old daughter, Sunday, to bed. She also impersonated the fairy tale\u2019s stem-climbing hero while her husband, the country singer Keith Urban, played the magic beans. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018I can\u2019t read this book again for the hundredth time,\u2019 so I said, \u2018We\u2019re going to do it!\u2019 \u201d Ms. Kidman, 45, said. (The couple also has a 19-month-old daughter, Faith, and Ms. Kidman has a daughter, Isabella, 19, and a son, Connor, 17, from her marriage to Tom Cruise.) \u201cSunday sat on her bed and watched us. She was into it,\u201d she said. Then she laughed. \u201cWell, she didn\u2019t tell us to stop.\u201d After nearly 30 years of making movies, no one is telling Ms. Kidman to stop taking on roles that challenge both her and what moviegoers think they know about her. Over a cappuccino at a Manhattan hotel last month she discussed her career and her latest unlikely role: as a Southern floozy in the intentionally pulpy drama \u201cThe Paperboy,\u201d opening Oct. 5. Directed by the maker of \u201cPrecious,\u201d Lee Daniels, the film earned both cheers and jeers for its audacity when it was shown at the Cannes Film Festival in May. Ms. Kidman, an elegant blonde, is strikingly tall (she\u2019s nearly 5 foot 11) and looked even taller in a chic black pantsuit. She spoke precisely but with an easy sense of humor. \u201cYou can ask me pretty much anything,\u201d she volunteered. \u201cThere\u2019ll be things I\u2019ll go, \u2018That feels a little too personal.\u2019 But most things I don\u2019t have a fear of being asked about.\u201d She said her career was founded on a drive to get inside the characters she plays. When she was younger, acting was about escaping her own insecurities by becoming someone else. Now, she said, \u201cit\u2019s the desire to study the human condition, the desire for collaboration, to learn and absorb, and to lead a well-examined life.\u201d Asked to name a role model for the next decade or two of her career, she instantly picked the French actress Isabelle Huppert. \u201cI love the danger in her career,\u201d Ms. Kidman said. The director Baz Luhrmann, her friend, fellow Aussie and two-time collaborator (\u201cMoulin Rouge!\u201d and \u201cAustralia\u201d), said that Ms. Kidman was a rare breed. \u201cNicole is a serious actor and an iconic movie star,\u201d he wrote in an e-mail. \u201cThis combination doesn\u2019t come along all that often.\u201d Off screen, he said, \u201cshe can be fantastically down to earth, straight to the point, and a whole lot of fun, with a particularly Aussie sense of humor that doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously.\u201d Another close friend, the actress Naomi Watts, praised Ms. Kidman\u2019s way of navigating between commercial and independent films. \u201cI think Nic has a wild streak in her and a very practical streak, and she manages to balance both very well, and that\u2019s evident in her work,\u201d Ms. Watts said in a phone interview. \u201cShe\u2019s a fascinating and complicated woman full of contradictions, and that\u2019s what makes her work so deep and interesting.\u201d Put \u201cThe Paperboy\u201d in the wild streak column. Based on the 1995 novel by Pete Dexter, the movie features Ms. Kidman as a seemingly hot-to-trot woman named Charlotte, a resident of a small town in Florida in 1969. She writes romantic letters to prison inmates and cavorts about in derri\u00e8re-hugging gold lam\u00e9 pants, tight tops and straightened, teased blond hair. \u201cI think straight hair gives me class,\u201d Charlotte mistakenly observes. Ms. Kidman\u2019s risqu\u00e9 \u201cPaperboy\u201d scenes include a steamy jailhouse make-out session, sans physical contact, with Charlotte\u2019s fianc\u00e9, a condemned murderer (played by John Cusack), and an already much-discussed beach scene in which she urinates on a worshipful young man (Zac Efron) in an effort to counteract his jellyfish stings. (In a line likely to become an instant camp classic, Charlotte, in shooing away other female, would-be Good Samaritans, proclaims that if anyone is going to urinate on the young man, \u201cit\u2019s gonna be me.\u201d) \u201cI wanted something raw, and I wanted to work with a director who was going to access something different in me,\u201d Ms. Kidman said of taking the part. \u201cThe script was really strong, so I was grateful to get the role.\u201d Mr. Daniels, who had directed only \u201cPrecious\u201d and \u201cShadowboxer\u201d (2005) before \u201cThe Paperboy,\u201d said that Ms. Kidman\u2019s formidable r\u00e9sum\u00e9 had him feeling intimidated initially. (Besides an Academy Award for her role as Virginia Woolf in \u201cThe Hours\u201d from 2002, she has earned two more Oscar nominations and worked in nearly 40 films). But \u201cshe said, \u2018Lee, if you\u2019re going to direct me, you\u2019ve got to understand that I\u2019m just a plain working girl,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cAnd she was.\u201d On the first day of shooting \u2014 Mr. Daniels doesn\u2019t believe in rehearsals \u2014 he had Ms. Kidman and Mr. Efron jump straight into the jellyfish scene. \u201cYou just go for it,\u201d she said. \u201cI think we did three takes, but it felt like a hundred.\u201d Mr. Efron said he admired Ms. Kidman\u2019s willingness to go full throttle in that scene \u2014 she slapped him so hard trying to revive him that she apologized afterward for hurting him \u2014 and the ones that followed. As a young actor he found it inspiring and instructive to see her \u201cgo unabashedly into a part like this and just let go,\u201d he recalled. \u201cShe\u2019s so unafraid. There are no walls up.\u201d",

        "article": "CHICAGO \u0097 Paul Volcker, who helped tame runaway inflation in the 1980s during two terms as chairman of the Federal Reserve, has agreed to lead a new White House economic advisory committee, President-elect Barack Obama said on Wednesday. He praised Mr. Volcker as \u201cone of the world\u2019s foremost economic policy experts.\u201d \u201cPaul has served under both Republicans and Democrats and is held in the highest esteem for his sound and independent judgment,\u201d Mr. Obama said, as the 6-foot 7-inch Mr. Volcker towered nearby. \u201cHe has a long and distinguished record of service to our nation, and I am pleased that he has answered the call to serve once again.\u201d Mr. Obama made the announcement at his third news conference in three days. The public appearances by the president-elect are intended to show Americans that his team is focusing on resolving the financial crisis, which Mr. Obama said Wednesday demands \u201cfresh thinking and bold new ideas from the leading minds across America.\u201d Mr. Volcker, 81, has been providing Mr. Obama with advice on the economy for months. After briefly considering him for Treasury secretary, Mr. Obama instead asked Mr. Volcker to lead the President\u2019s Economic Recovery Advisory Board, a new panel to be comprised of leading figures from a variety of business sectors. The group is supposed to advise Mr. Obama on how to jump-start the economy and stabilize the financial markets. Austan Goolsbee, a University of Chicago economist who was a leading economic adviser to the Obama presidential campaign, will lead the staff of the advisory board, the president-elect said, calling him \u201cone of America\u2019s most promising economic minds, known for his path-breaking work on tax policy and industrial organization.\u201d Mr. Volcker became chairman of the Federal Reserve in August 1979 as President Jimmy Carter was fighting to rein in the inflation caused by the oil shocks of 1973 and 1978. Mr. Volcker, who led the Fed until 1987, often used tactics that were unpopular, like rapid increases in interest rates. Criticized at the time for causing a recession, Mr. Volcker was later praised for the effectiveness of his efforts. The president-elect\u2019s decision to name Mr. Volcker to a new economic panel was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. \u201cThis board will provide that fresh perspective to me and my administration, with an infusion of ideas from across the country and from all sectors of our economy, input that will be informed by members\u2019 firsthand observations of how our efforts are impacting the daily lives of our families,\u201d the president-elect said. He said he would announce other members of the board in the coming weeks, and that he wanted the panel to be \u201ccandid and unsparing\u201d in its assessments. In a brief question-answer session, Mr. Obama said his call for new ways of thinking should not be interpreted as a reflection of frustration and disappointment with the Bush administration\u2019s recent economic-recovery efforts. Rather, Mr. Obama said, his proposals reflect frustration over \u201ceight years in which middle-class wages have gone down or, in real terms, their family incomes have been reduced.\u201d \u201cIt speaks to my frustration about all the families that I\u2019ve met over the last two years who have lost their health insurance, or their pensions are in danger, young people who can\u2019t afford to go to college,\u201d the president-elect said. \u201cIt expresses frustration about our inability to tackle some of the long-term problems that we\u2019ve been facing, and have been talking about for decades, whether it\u2019s health care, energy, an education system that\u2019s been slipping behind in critical areas like math or science,\u201d he said, \u201cand, most of all, I think, frustration with the incapacity of Washington to take bold, clear, decisive steps to deal with our economic problems.\u201d Responding to a question about the holiday shopping season, which many retailers predict will be a dismal one, the president-elect said, \u201cWhat we don\u2019t want to do is get caught up in a spiral, where people pull back from the economy, businesses then pull back, jobs are reduced, and we get into a downward spiral.\u201d \u201cWhat we want to do is to be sober, to be clear, to recognize that we\u2019ve got some real adjustments that have to be made,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cThat\u2019s true with \u0097 in individual businesses. It\u2019s true in terms of individual family budgets. It\u2019s also true for the economy as a whole. \u201cBut we continue to have the best workers in the world. We continue to have the most innovation in the world. We continue to be in possession of extraordinary resources that, if we harness properly, will get this economy moving over the next couple of years but also over the next two decades or three decades.\u201d David Stout contributed reporting from Washington.",

        "article": "A new report from Human Rights Watch paints a grim picture of child labor in the United States, something that most Americans probably believe was banned years ago. Children as young as 7 are working on tobacco farms in North Carolina, Kentucky, Tennessee and Virginia, and many are said to suffer from the symptoms of acute nicotine poisoning. There are no good estimates of how many youngsters work on tobacco farms, but Human Rights Watch said it interviewed 140 children, most of whom work alongside their parents, who are migrant farmworkers, during the summer and on weekends. Their stories, some recorded on video, highlight gaping flaws in how America regulates child labor on farms. Under federal laws and regulations, children can work on any farm, not just those owned by their families, outside school hours and in hazardous conditions if their parents let them. And there are no restrictions on how many hours they can work. By contrast, the government has far stricter rules for teenagers who work in retail stores and restaurants. There is little doubt that the work is backbreaking and dangerous. Some of the children interviewed by Human Rights Watch say they often vomit, lose their appetites, have nausea and suffer from headaches \u2014 symptoms associated with nicotine poisoning. The children absorb nicotine through their skin when they handle tobacco leaves in the process of cutting, weeding and harvesting plants. One 13-year-old in North Carolina, Elena G., told Human Rights Watch: \u201cI felt like I was going to faint. I would stop and just hold myself up with the tobacco plant.\u201d Most cigarette companies do not insist that the farms they buy tobacco from refrain from employing children. Worse still, in 2012 the Obama administration abandoned regulations that would have restricted children younger than 16 from \u201cparticipating in the cultivation, harvesting and curing of tobacco\u201d after Republican lawmakers opposed the proposal by falsely claiming that the rules would keep children from working on family farms. The Human Rights Watch report should be a loud alarm for the tobacco industry and lawmakers in Washington. Philip Morris International says it is working to eliminate the use of child labor for a list of hazardous tasks on the roughly 500,000 farms around the world that it buys tobacco from, but most other companies have not made similar commitments. For example, a spokesman for Altria told NPR recently that restrictions on young people \u201chandling or coming into contact with tobacco is counter to a lot of farming practices that currently take place in the U.S.\u201d All cigarette companies should use their buying power to make sure tobacco growers stop hiring children under 18 to work in their fields. But the country cannot simply rely on industry promises. The tobacco companies\u2019 long history of marketing their products to teenagers is good reason to question their commitments on health issues. Congress and the Obama administration should change the law to restrict child labor in hazardous agricultural work. A version of this editorial appears in print on May 18, 2014, on page SR10 of the New York edition with the headline: Children Don\u2019t Belong in Tobacco Fields.

        "article": "Among the occupants of Vienna's new pedestrian \"Golden Quarter\": Herm\u00e9s and Louis Vuitton. VIENNA \u2014 As luscious and curvaceous as on the day that she was sculpted, the naked lady adorns the 1900 building in Vienna\u2019s central square. But now this sinuous symbol of the historic Austrian city is being offered luxurious new clothes. Lots of them. A new pedestrian shopping area, to be known as the \u201cGolden Quarter,\u201d is still under construction. But even before its completion, scheduled for 2014, Louis Vuitton has taken over a historic building, with Emporio Armani and Miu Miu up the road and a stream of international names from Brioni through Roberto Cavalli to Prada and Saint Laurent lined up to arrive next year. The refurbished area, nestled between St. Stephen\u2019s Cathedral and the stock exchange in the Unesco World Heritage area of Vienna, includes a building from a century ago located at the Am Hof square and the historic Hochholzerhof building in the Tuchlauben area. The area\u2019s transformation into a pedestrian zone will include a five-star Park Hyatt hotel and luxury apartments, as well as the high-end stores. Wealthy Russians looking to invest in bricks and mortar and a swelling number of Chinese visitors have inspired this gilded shopping area in the heart of a city that has been rejuvenated by the opening up of Eastern Europe. But affluent consumers and the super rich are not alone in wanting something new out of old Vienna. Far from the touristy central part of the city, with its grandiose fountains and glorious buildings, there is another mini-shopping revolution: an outbreak of small stores that are tucked behind the major shopping roads or in areas that the locals define as \u201cBobo\u201d for \u201cBohemian bourgeois.\u201d One such area is the seventh district, west of central Vienna. \u201cWe started in the seventh district, which once housed textiles, silk and embroidery,\u201d said Barbara Irma Denk, whose mission is to open up to visitors a more contemporary vision of art, craft and fashion than the city\u2019s usual offerings of Gustav Klimt\u2019s paintings, cream pastries in period tea shops and upgrades on the classic dirndl skirts. With the encouragement of the district mayor, Thomas Blimlinger, Ms. Denk founded 7tm (www.7tm.at), a company that helps promote the fashion and design shops in the seventh district. (The 7 in the company stands for the district and the tm stands for trademark.) The company started in 2007 by representing 20 to 30 shops and has expanded to cover an area with 57 stores, with names like Disaster Clothing, Common People and Less is More. These indie stores have a flavor of back-street Berlin and this area of the city, known as Neubau, has a young, liberal, urban population. Ms. Denk has mapped out a route in the district that gives \u201cadventurous consumers\u201d bespoke tours of the city. \u201cWe changed focus from just textile designers to furniture, which is an interesting and good combination,\u201d Ms. Denk said. Her group of independent retailers, following the Viennese tradition of cobblers, craftspeople and textile designers, are often housed in part of the solid and spacious buildings created by the architect Otto Wagner when the city was at a pinnacle of prosperity. The Internet has helped these fledgling companies to expand beyond their local areas, so that the bag designer Ina Kent (inakent.com) gets orders from distant places. \u201cBags tell stories\u201d is the designer\u2019s mantra \u2014 and her tale is of transformation: colorful purses that can be attached to larger bags that, in turn, can morph, with the twist of twin straps, into a backpack. As with so many of these homegrown companies, the prices are way down on the luxury labels: from less than \u20ac100, or $130, to \u20ac350 for the Ina Kent bags. With Austria and Germany founding many \u201cgreen\u201d movements, Vienna\u2019s indie brands are often striving for good social and environmental practices, a feeling that runs through the 7tm fashion collective and is encouraged by Ms. Denk herself. One store in the district, Madame with a Mission (www.mwam.at), supports a local social-economic women\u2019s company where the collection is produced. The company\u2019s founder, Susanne Kreuzberger, says the organization\u2019s motto is: \u201cKeep it simple and sophisticated.\u201d",

        "article": "New Jersey governor Chris Christie sought on Thursday to dampen growing expectations about a presidential campaign, warning that fevered speculation over national elections in 2016 risked hurting Republican chances in the 2014 mid-terms. Speaking as he assumed chairmanship of the politically influential Republican Governor's Association, at its annual conference in Arizona, Christie also tempered his message on national political issues. He has been increasingly vocal and combative since his landslide re-election two weeks ago. The search for potential presidential nominees has dominated this year's RGA conference and chairmanship of the body has in the past provided a useful springboard to meetings with potential donors. But the New Jersey governor appears to have recognised that it is time to project a more collegiate face, if he wants to avoid alienating the party's base before he even gets to a primary race. \u201cWe have 36 [gubernatorial] races and 20 incumbent governors standing in 2014 and anyone of us in our individual capacity or as leaders of this organisation start thinking about 2016 at our own peril and worse, at the peril of our colleagues,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cMy focus is going to be on raising funds to get their stories out. 2016 is a long way away and I am two weeks out of a campaign. I am not looking to start speculating about other campaigns already.\u201d Christie's national prominence has irritated some at the conference in Scottsdale, where attempts to contrast the relative success of state governors with dysfunction in Washington have been overshadowed by jockeying for the White House. \u201cThey all think they are important and they hate to see someone stealing all the limelight,\u201d said one party official, in private. Christie teased a reporter who asked him whether governors made good presidents, joking: \u201cI am stunned that we have gotten that question right out of the box. We are ill-prepared. I will try my best to deal with it.\u201d Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal, who has also made no secret of his presidential ambitions, was similarly dismissive as he stood down as RGA chairman. \u201cPeople want to focus on 2016, but there are a lot of elections we need to focus on first in 2014,\u201d he said. But CNN reported on Thursday that Christie and Jindal fought an at-time acrimonious battle to decide which of them would run the governors' association during this crucial preparatory year \u2013 a personal rivalry driven in large part by their competing presidential considerations. The RGA raises money on a national stage and gives governors a chance to meet potential backers for their own race in a way not available to rivals in Congress. Growing competition with potential Republican rivals in Washington is already apparent in the behaviour of Christie and Jindal, who spent much of the conference arguing that governors had much more practical experience than Senate-based rivals such as Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz and Rand Paul. \u201cWhat you have seen over the last two days is the incredible contrast between what you see being discussed here and accomplished as opposed to what you see going on in Washington DC,\u201d said Christie. \u201cWhat I've heard from governors and what we've accomplished \u2026 is going to be a strong and compelling message for people across the country.\u201d But the New Jersey governor shied away from expressing his normally forthright opinions on national political issues which might alienate Republican voters in a primary election, refusing to say, for example, whether he now backed immigration reform. \"How it needs to be fixed will be determined by the national leaders. What that solution contains is going to be up to them to determine,\" he said, during tetchy exchanges with a reporter asking for a yes or no answer. \"I don't have to answer the question you want me to.\"",

        "article": "There is the Mark Zuckerberg of \u201cThe Social Network.\u201d At least based on press reports, he is a paranoid \u201cinsecure jerk\u201d pressing his nose against the window of Harvard\u2019s finals clubs, whose entree into fame was Facebook. Then there\u2019s the real-life Mr. Zuckerberg, who\u2019s \u2026 well, for anyone outside his small coterie of friends, it\u2019s hard to say. Based on The New Yorker\u2019s long profile of the Facebook founder this week, however, there are a few elements to go on. He apparently isn\u2019t motivated by money; he\u2019s better socially adjusted than you think, but not by much; and he really believes in a less private world. Facebook has strenuously (and Mr. Zuckerberg more quietly) asserted that the portrayal of the company\u2019s founding in \u201cThe Social Network\u201d is fiction. That may not necessarily matter in the end: it may be the most the general public ever tries to find out about Mr. Zuckerberg, and Media Memo\u2019s Peter Kafka says he\u2019ll watch the movie again. But what comes across in The New Yorker profile is that Mr. Zuckerberg is a talented programmer who insists on following through on his vision for Facebook. The magazine recounts the surprising number of times that Mr. Zuckerberg declined an early payout for his site, even as the numbers reached 7 digits: In 2005, MTV Networks considered buying Facebook for seventy-five million dollars. Yahoo! and Microsoft soon offered much more. Zuckerberg turned them all down. Terry Semel, the former C.E.O. of Yahoo!, who sought to buy Facebook for a billion dollars in 2006, told me, \u201cI\u2019d never met anyone\u2014forget his age, twenty-two then or twenty-six now\u2014I\u2019d never met anyone who would walk away from a billion dollars. But he said, \u2018It\u2019s not about the price. This is my baby, and I want to keep running it, I want to keep growing it.\u2019 I couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d That also apparently applies to him in other areas as well. He\u2019s found all his abodes via Craigslist \u2014 and rents; he drives an Acura TSX; and plays bocce a lot with his girlfriend. While Mr. Zuckerberg disputes the characterization of him in the movie, he cops to having indulged in a bit of sophomoric arrogance. The New Yorker confirms the authenticity of several instant messages obtained by Business Insider earlier this year. Mr. Zuckerberg pleads that he\u2019s grown since then, and backers like Jim Breyer of Accel Partners profess support for him still. The New Yorker also made a strangely moving, if also awkward, connection between Mr. Zuckerberg and Aaron Sorkin, the writer of \u201cThe Social Network:\u201d I told Sorkin that his TV series was one of Zuckerberg\u2019s favorites. He paused. \u201cI wish you hadn\u2019t told me that,\u201d he said finally. When I asked Sorkin to guess the episode that Zuckerberg liked best, he said, \u201cThe Lemon-Lyman episode\u201d\u2014the one in Season Three where Josh Lyman, the deputy chief of staff, played by Bradley Whitford, discovers that he has a following on an online message board and unwisely interacts with its members. Actually, Zuckerberg\u2019s favorite episode, he told me, was \u201cTwo Cathedrals,\u201d at the end of Season Two, in which Martin Sheen, who plays President Josiah Bartlet, grieves at the death of his longtime secretary and, after disclosing that he has multiple sclerosis, ponders whether he should seek re\u00eblection. He is inside the National Cathedral and orders that it be temporarily sealed. He curses God in Latin and lights a cigarette. \u201cIt\u2019s, like, even in journeys like Facebook, we\u2019ve had some very serious ups and downs,\u201d Zuckerberg said. Zuckerberg says that many of the details he has read about the film are just wrong. (He had, for example, no interest in joining any of the final clubs.) When pressed about the movie and what it means for his public persona, he responded coolly: \u201cI know the real story.\u201d A few days after we spoke, Zuckerberg changed his Facebook profile, removing \u201cThe West Wing\u201d from his list of favorite TV shows. Speaking of Facebook profiles, The New Yorker delves into the thorniest issue confronting the social networking giant today: privacy. Mr. Zuckerberg is sincere about promoting what he calls \u201copenness\u201d among the site\u2019s users; his critics call the stance invasive. But at the least, it seems Facebook has more than a little self-awareness of what it calls the \u201cthird-rail issue.\u201d An employee, addressing the constant criticism of the site\u2019s privacy settings, had written, \u201cHow do I delete my post??? Why don\u2019t you care about my privacy? Why is the default for this app everyone??\u201d Inside is a giant sea of desks\u2014no cubicles, no partitions, just open space with small conference rooms named after bands (Run-DMC, New Edition, ZZ Top) and bad ideas (Knife at a Gunfight, Subprime Mortgage, Beacon\u2014a controversial advertising system that Facebook introduced in 2007 and then scrapped).

        "article": "This week\u2019s news of Microsoft\u2019s $26.2 billion plan to buy LinkedIn and Symantec\u2019s decision to purchase Blue Coat for $4.65 billion means that the floodgates for software M&A are opening. And, when I say \u201csoftware\u201d I mean \u201ccloud.\u201d Because increasingly companies are buying software that flows over the Internet to their computers or other devices and is managed by the software provider at its own data centers. As Fortune\u2019s Dan Primack pointed out Thursday, these two deals show that buying publicly held software companies is now more doable than it has been for a while. Why? Prices have come down considerably. For the past few years, the price-to-earnings ratios on these public companies were nuts. Now? Less nutty. So, expect some action. There\u2019s been considerable speculation that SAP sap , the enterprise software giant that is trying to boost its cloud business, is looking for opportunities. Its last big acquisition was of Concur, the expense accounting and travel management software maker, two years ago for $8.3 billion. Possible candidates? The Street posited that Workday wday (human resources software) or Cornerstone on Demand csod (talent management software) are possible targets, but SAP already dropped $3.4 billion in cash to buy SuccessFactors, a power in that space, five years ago, so there would be considerable overlap. Jive jive a maker of business-focused collaboration and messaging software, also mentioned in that piece, might make more sense. Here\u2019s the broader story. Legacy software companies\u2014from Adobe adbe Systems to IBM, Oracle, and Microsoft msft \u2014are all negotiating the same nail-biting transition from selling expensive software that runs at the customer\u2019s site to selling the aforementioned software-as-a-service which streams over the Internet but which basically runs on the software provider\u2019s data center. That provider, not the customer, handles all the hardware, software updates and patching. \u201cThose old-line companies desperately need to finesse the transition from on-premise software to cloud and the easiest way to do that is to buy more cloud companies,\u201d said Joshua Greenbaum, principal of Enterprise Applications Consulting. You have to pity those companies, according to Greenbaum. \u201cThe street wants them to grow like cloud companies but generate profits like enterprise software companies. It\u2019s a dance with the devil.\u201d To be clear there have been some acquisitions in recent months leading up to the Microsoft and Symantec symc frenzy. In April, Oracle oclcf announced the purchase of construction and project management software company Textura txtr for $663 million. A month later it followed with news of plans to buy OPower, opwr for its energy management expertise for $532 million. But these are niche, mid-sized deals aimed to boost Oracle in vertical markets, not the blockbuster purchases of the sort pundits now expect (want?) to see. For more on Microsoft and LinkedIn, watch: Other potential targets include NetSuite n , which sells accounting software and ServiceNow servicenow , which specializes in IT service management. Both are in the hot software-as-a-service category, the subscription sales model which has become the delivery model of choice of businesses. It\u2019s also possible that Box box and even Salesforce crm might draw serious interest. (Salesforce has a market cap of about $55 billion, so that would be a very large deal.) Get Data Sheet, Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter. Speculation has swirled that IBM ibm which is in the midst of a difficult transformation, may get truly bold with an acquisition there. Box would get IBM in front of corporate end-users which would be useful for a company that sells to C-level executives, but has become nearly invisible to consumers since it sold its PC business 12 years ago. And tighter ties between public cloud giant Amazon and Salesforce have fueled speculation that Amazon might just buy Salesforce to boost Amazon amzn Web Services in big accounts where Salesforce is strong. It\u2019s a reach, but stranger things have happened. Remember AOL and Time Warner?",

        "article": "Members of the NASA control room team in Pasadena, Calif., celebrated after the rover Curiosity landed on Mars. More Photos \u00bb PASADENA, Calif. \u2014 NASA followed up its picture-perfect landing of a plutonium-powered rover Sunday night with a picture of the balletic Mars landing \u2014 as well as some well-earned self-congratulation about what the accomplishment says about NASA\u2019s ingenuity. \u201cThere are many out in the community who say NASA has lost its way, that we don\u2019t know how to explore \u2014 we\u2019ve lost our moxie,\u201d John M. Grunsfeld, associate administrator for NASA\u2019s science mission directorate, said at a post-landing news conference, where beaming members of the landing team, all clad in blue polo shirts, crammed in next to the reporters. \u201cI want you to look around tonight, at those folks with the blue shirts and think about what we\u2019ve achieved.\u201d That achievement, in the early hours of Monday morning Eastern time, was indeed dramatic: with the eyes of the world watching, the car-size craft called Curiosity was lowered at the end of 25-foot cables from a hovering rocket stage, successfully touching down on a gravelly Martian plain. For the world of science, it was the second slam-dunk this summer \u2014 the first one being the announcement last month that the Higgs boson, a long-sought particle theorized by physicists, had likely been found. But while the focus of high-energy physics world has shifted overseas to CERN, the European laboratory, the United States remains the center of the universe for space, ahead of Russia, Europe and China, and for NASA, it was a chance to parry accusations of being slow, bloated and rudderless. \u201cIf anybody has been harboring doubts about the status of U.S. leadership in space,\u201d John P. Holdren, the president\u2019s science adviser, said at the news conference, \u201cwell, there\u2019s a one-ton automobile-size piece of American ingenuity. And it\u2019s sitting on the surface of Mars right now.\u201d Now that it has reached Mars, Curiosity ushers in a new era of exploration that could turn up evidence that the Red Planet once had the necessary ingredients for life \u2014 or might even still harbor life today. Far larger than earlier rovers, Curiosity is packed with the most sophisticated movable laboratory that has ever been sent to another planet. It is to spend at least two years examining rocks within the 96-mile crater it landed in, looking for carbon-based molecules and other evidence that early Mars had conditions friendly for life. On Monday, NASA released a photograph taken by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, showing Curiosity still encased in the descent capsule as it sailed under a parachute 210 miles below. \u201cYou can see the lines on the parachute,\u201d said Sarah Milkovich, a NASA scientist who works with the orbiter camera. NASA officials were working to give Dr. Holdren a framed print of the photograph to show President Obama. Only one other country, the Soviet Union, has successfully landed anything on Mars, and that spacecraft, Mars 3 in 1971, fell silent shortly after landing. So far, this rover appears to be healthy. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot ahead of us, but so far we are just ecstatic about the performance of the vehicle,\u201d said Jennifer Trosper, one of the mission managers.As the spacecraft sped toward its destination on Sunday, the pull of Mars\u2019s gravity accelerating it to more than 13,000 miles per hour, officials tried to tamp down concerns that a crash would entirely derail future plans. \u201cA failure is a setback,\u201d said Doug McCuistion, the Mars exploration program director. \u201cIt\u2019s not a disaster.\u201d The Curiosity landing seemed particularly risky. Engineers chose not to use the tried-and-true systems used in the six previous successful landings, neither the landing legs of the Viking missions in 1976 nor the cocoons of air bags that cushioned the two rovers that NASA placed on Mars in 2004. Those approaches, they said, would not work for a one-ton vehicle. Instead, for the final landing step, they came up with what they called the sky crane maneuver. The rover would be gently winched to the surface from a hovering rocket stage. As the drama of the landing unfolded, each step proceeded without flaw. The capsule entered the atmosphere at the appointed time, with thrusters guiding it toward the crater. The parachute deployed. Then the rover and rocket stage dropped away from the parachute and began a powered descent toward the surface, and the sky crane maneuver worked as designed.

        "article": "CreditRebecca Smeyne for The New York Times At 5 p.m. Sunday, much of West 51st Street was shut down. Japanese tourists stood behind barricades. Comic-book fanboys carried Sharpies. Ben Affleck and Henry Cavill were set to arrive for the premiere of \u201cBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.\u201d It felt like a giant commercial, particularly with a new Jeep Renegade parked in front of the hangar-size media tent outside Radio City Music Hall, as executives from Turkish Airlines ambled up to reporters, requesting interviews. Both brands had sponsored the movie and its premiere in exchange for being written into the plot. Among the first to make her way down the carpet was Diane Lane, who wore black stiletto boots and a green-and-yellow printed dress from Naeem Khan. She plays Superman\u2019s mother, a casting choice that maybe says something depressing about older women in Hollywood. Her onscreen son, played by Mr. Cavill, is just 18 years younger than her in real life. \u201cWe did some funny math for sure,\u201d Ms. Lane said. Next came Holly Hunter, who plays a senator investigating whether Superman is Gotham\u2019s great hope or a narcissistic terrorist, followed by Amy Adams, who plays Lois Lane. Mr. Affleck arrived moments later, looking well coifed, if somewhat leaner than his buff character. \u201cThe hardest thing was the training,\u201d he said, standing on the carpet in a dark green Gucci suit, as he talked on-camera to a Variety reporter. \u201cIt took a year.\u201d Will Smith also showed up, perhaps to promote his own superhero franchise. He rushed past reporters just as the screening was about to begin, wearing a blue Kangol-like hat. Someone yelled out, \u201cTeam Batman or Team Superman?\u201d \u201cTeam Deadshot,\u201d he replied, referring to a character he plays in the DC Comics film \u201cSuicide Squad.\u201d Interest in the Batman film has been intense, in part because Warner Bros. has been selective about inviting critics to early screenings and has been warning reporters not to reveal the plot. This audience seemed less interested, judging by the frequency of bathroom breaks during the 2-hour-33-minute movie. One woman could be seen texting during one of the pivotal action scenes. The after-party was at Guastavino\u2019s under the Queensboro Bridge, where a virtual film set had been built to evoke Gotham, complete with panoramic skylines and life-size figures of Batman and Superman standing over a bar. \u201cThis is insane,\u201d said the film\u2019s director, Zack Snyder, who has directed other blockbusters like \u201c300\u201d and \u201cSuperman: Man of Steel,\u201d adding that this premiere was by far the biggest any of his films had received. Nearby, Jesse Eisenberg posed for selfies with fans and said he was pleased to play Lex Luthor, another tortured character that he acknowledged was an extension of the sort of Baumbachian antiheroes for which he\u2019s known. Ms. Adams was perched near the bar, as was Gal Gadot, who plays Wonder Woman. But the biggest crowd still formed around Mr. Affleck and Mr. Cavill, who arrived around 10 p.m., looking like overhandled sheep in a petting zoo as photographers (professional and otherwise) mobbed them, angling for pictures.

        "article": "The Los Angeles city attorney is calling on the City Council to implement a \u201cgentle ban\u201d on marijuana dispensaries that would forbid businesses from selling the drug \u2013- but still allow patients who are seriously ill and their caregivers to cultivate it. At a council committee meeting on Friday, City Atty. Carmen Trutanich and several of his top lawyers recommended that officials revoke the current ordinance regulating marijuana dispensaries, which calls for a lottery to choose which dispensaries to allow. In October, the 2nd District Court of Appeal in Los Angeles ruled that Long Beach, which carried out a lottery similar to the one proposed in L.A., violated federal law on the grounds that the city was, in essence, sanctioning the distribution of an illegal drug. Jane Usher, a special assistant city attorney, told the Public Safety Committee that the decision, which Long Beach has appealed to the state Supreme Court, limits what municipalities can do to control dispensaries. \u201cThey left very, very little for cities to lawfully do,\u201d she said. Usher said L.A.'s ordinance has been challenged in more than 60 lawsuits filed by marijuana dispensaries and patients, and has cost the city millions of dollars to fight. She warned that if the city does not revoke the ordinance \u201cit is simply a manner of time, from a risk management point of view, before we have a ruling against the city of Los Angeles on the same grounds.\u201d Under Trutanich's proposal, the city would not prosecute ill patients or their caregivers who were growing marijuana, as long as there was no third party involved and no money was changing hands. The proposal will come before the full council eventually, but not before it is first heard in the Planning and Land Use Management Committee. One medical marijuana dispensary worker decried the proposal and said she and others have been trying for years to get the city to adopt a workable ordinance. Sarah Armstrong, a medical marijuana advocate who helps run a dispensary in Reseda, said hundreds of \u201crogue\u201d dispensaries that have opened up in recent years have given a bad rap to older, more responsible operations that want to follow the law and cooperate with the city. At the meeting on Friday, police officers and other city officials gave testimony about crime surrounding some dispensaries. \u201cWe\u2019re tired of being tarred with the same brush,\u201d she said. She dismissed the proposed prohibition as politically motivated -- Trutanich is considering a run for Los Angeles County district attorney -- and said medical marijuana activists were prepared to resort to a voter referendum to reaffirm the right to use dispensaries. Armstrong said \u201cthere\u2019s no such thing as a gentle ban,\u201d since many primary caregivers don't have the time to grow marijuana.

        "article": "The Leadership Insider network is an online community where the most thoughtful and influential people in business contribute answers to timely questions about careers and leadership. Today\u2019s answer to the question \u201cWhat advice would you give your 22-year-old self today?\u201d is written by Ashley Goldsmith, chief human resource officer at Workday. One of my favorite quotes has always been, \u201cluck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.\u201d It\u2019s something I\u2019ve been able to relate to throughout my career, from my first job at Home Depot hd to my current role as CHRO at Workday. And it\u2019s something that every 20-something should understand. Companies today are really excited about the energy and ideas that this next generation brings to the table. But it\u2019s up to these young professionals to seize the opportunity and make the most of it. Here\u2019s my best advice for millennials seeking success: Gain credibility early on Making a good first impression is important, and especially crucial when you\u2019re first starting out. Jump in and roll up your sleeves \u2014 regardless of whether it\u2019s part of your job description. You\u2019ll get noticed for stepping up, and others will know they can count on you to deliver. Reliability can also go a long way in building credibility. If you say you\u2019ll keep something in confidence, put it in the vault, and throw away the key; if you say you\u2019re going to call someone back, do it. Mastering these skills will earn you trust and establish a work ethic you\u2019ll carry with you to your next role. See also: The One Thing I Regret Not Doing in my 20s Study your environment In my first job at Home Depot, I paid close attention to what other people did in the workplace. I noticed that there are so many nuances at work \u2013 from office norms and behavior in meetings to how colleagues communicate when questioned or challenged. These experiences aren\u2019t taught in school, so learning to navigate these situations early on will help you adapt to the company culture and be more effective. Asking for feedback is also a way to help you acclimate to a new work environment. Knowing what\u2019s working and what\u2019s not will help you improve yourself for future opportunities. Be confident Confidence is something that typically builds over time as you start to get positive feedback about your work, but you have to start somewhere. If you speak with authority and have the facts to back up what you\u2019re saying, people will listen. Take the time to learn your industry and prepare ahead of meetings. Stay on top of the latest company news and industry headlines so if you get two minutes in the elevator with the CEO, you can say something intelligent and memorable. Embrace new opportunities When I first started working, I was placed in several roles at Home Depot that I felt were beyond my scope of experience, but in the end I succeeded. When people are given an opportunity, most of the time they\u2019ll rise to the occasion. It pays to take risks early on, so don\u2019t be afraid to apply for a job that may be a stretch for you, take on a new project, or embrace a role in a different department \u2014 a lateral move can be just as developmental as a promotion. It\u2019s also very rare that someone is 100% ready to take on a new role or responsibility, so don\u2019t be scared to take a leap into unknown waters. If you do your best to prepare and master it, the odds are you won\u2019t fail. Find your passion Sometimes it takes a while to find a role and a company culture that taps into your passions. In my early 20\u2019s, I didn\u2019t initially look at my career as something that would be one of the best parts of my life, but today it\u2019s an integral part of who I am and how I contribute to those around me. Family will always come first, but work can be a special part of your life as well. If you find yourself in a position where your job doesn\u2019t quite suit your personality and personal goals, it may be time to switch careers.",

        "article": "\u201cLA has a river?\u201d That was the incredulous reaction I got when I told friends I was planning to kayak the Los Angeles River \u2013 that and jokes about polluted water and mutated fish. Despite living in a city that\u2019s steeped in Hollywood history, Angelenos seem have a short memory: the waterway, after all, has made appearances in films such as Grease, Chinatown and Terminator 2: Judgment Day, as well as in countless TV shows. It also turns up on the news occasionally, when firefighters pull unlucky people from its rushing water during rainstorms. Films tend to feature the river\u2019s concrete-lined, graffiti-covered sections (after a series of deadly floods in the 1930s, the US Army Corps of Engineers turned much of the waterway into a flood-control channel), but in actuality, the Los Angeles River is a whopping 51 miles long, running from Canoga Park in the San Fernando Valley, along the edge of downtown LA and all the way to the ocean at Long Beach. And the whole river is enjoying a renaissance as restored park-like sections are now open for kayaking \u2013 at least for a short window in the summer months, between July and September. When I arrived at the Balboa Boulevard bridge, located about 15 miles northeast of downtown LA, I had a hard time imagining I was in kayaking country. Then, down a sloping path, I spotted water surrounded by plants and bushes, and an egret flew overhead. There was indeed life in this urban waterway. I\u2019d signed on for a group kayaking trip with LA Conservation Corps, an organization that educates and employs people in a variety of conservation projects, including building parks, planting trees, refurbishing hiking trails and forming community gardens. They and several other groups are allowed to lead kayaking tours along the river; going by yourself is illegal. As our group of 10 paddled downstream, the hum of traffic was replaced with the sounds of birds, buzzing insects and splashing water. Reeds, bushes and sunflowers appeared at the river\u2019s edge. The riverbed was a mix of mud, gravel and sand, peppered with algae-covered utility pipes and the odd lost golf ball from a nearby course. This two-and-a-half mile section of the river cautiously opened to the public in 2011 as part of a pilot programme. Three years before, environmentalist Joe Linton, George Wolfe of LA River Expeditions, and a few others had trespassed onto the then-closed river in an attempt to prove that the waterway was navigable by kayak. Though much of their three-day journey was accomplished on foot, their adventure convinced the Environmental Protection Agency to deem the waterway navigable, and thus subject to a variety of environmental regulations. Linton was among the group kayaking with me, and he explained that Los Angeles gets some of its usable water from the river, and has for years. The river was one of the reasons that the first Spanish settlers \u2013 and the native peoples before them \u2013 planted roots here. As we paddled on, majestic herons flew overhead. We spotted the blue flash of a kingfisher, a sure sign that edible fish resided below. At the newly christened Rocky Rapids we took a stop-start, bumpy slide down a tiny rocky waterfall, while at the section of the river called Lake Balboa Ledge, we had to get out and walk among huge boulders. I loved it \u2013 and felt a world away from the busy city. Egrets stalked the water for minnows as we passed through the Grand Canyon, a mini-version of the Colorado landmark, where craggy earthen walls towered over us \u2013 the result of erosion caused by non-native plants. Then we bumped and floated down Cattail Shoot, another jumble of water and huge stones. As we neared the end of our journey, back at the Burbank Boulevard bridge, we were reminded of the challenges still facing the river: a shopping cart was partly submerged and dirty plastic bags clung to tree branches on the riverbank. \u201cThey\u2019re swept into the drains from all over the city, and they\u2019re the river\u2019s worst enemy,\u201d said Linton, adding that the plastic bags never biodegrade and can kill larger animals on shore. We passed someone fishing from the riverbank (you can catch catfish, tilapia and carp here) and a couple of sunburnt sunbathers in the dense growth at the river\u2019s edge. Before hitting land, we gathered our kayaks and talked about the river\u2019s future. In 2014, the US Army Corps of Engineers proposed a $1 billion revitalisation plan for an 11-mile stretch of the river between downtown Los Angeles and Griffith Park \u2013 a stretch that\u2019s not yet accessible or open to the public. The plan has yet to be approved, but it did prompt the Los Angeles City Council to promise to restore the 30 or so river miles that run through Los Angeles County, from downtown to Canoga Park. Among other things, that could lead to the construction of wider bridges and the re-greening of park areas, as well as the addition of bike lanes, walkways and cafes along the riverbanks. One of the earliest written records of the Los Angeles River was by penned Father Juan Crespi, the diarist for the Spanish expedition led by Gaspar de Portola. In 1769, Crespi noted that the area was a \u201clush and pleasant space\u201d. Now, nearly 250 years later, Angelenos hope it will become that once again.",

        "article": "Lydia Cuomo had been preparing to start her dream job as an elementary school teacher at a Bronx charter school in August 2011 when she was forced into anal and oral sex by a cop who threatened her with a gun. It's been nearly a year since a schoolteacher sat in a Manhattan courthouse and learned that parts of a gunpoint sexual assault she endured at the hands of a city cop were not considered rape. Lydia Cuomo, using her name and speaking out in her first major interview since the attack on Aug. 19, 2011, was the young woman dragged into a courtyard in Inwood and brutalized as she waited for a ride to work. It was supposed to be her first day at her dream job, teaching second-graders at a Bronx charter school. Michael Pena, a drunken off-duty cop, asked her for directions to the subway about 6:15 a.m., as she waited for her principal to pick her up. Suddenly, the predator pointed his department-issued 9-mm handgun at Cuomo\u2019s face. Then Pena threatened to kill the teacher before violating her in every way imaginable. The cop was convicted at trial last year of forcing anal and oral sex on Cuomo \u2014 but not of rape. Now Cuomo, 26, is fighting back. She\u2019s lending her voice to a legislative effort to change state law to put forced oral and anal sex under New York\u2019s rape statute. \u201cI feel like essentially I had a silver platter of a rape case,\u201d she told the Daily News. \u201cI had witnesses, I had DNA, I had my own testimony, I had two cops. I had them saying, \u2018We admit he sexually assaulted you,\u2019 and I didn\u2019t get the verdict I needed the first time, and that just highlights to me the problem in the system.\u201d The verdict led to a News front page demanding \u201cWhat does a woman have to do to prove she was raped?\u201d Cuomo still has that front page. As she focuses on the battle in Albany, Cuomo recalled the joy of landing the Bronx teaching gig. As her start date approached, she was so happy about the job that she could barely sleep. \u201cI was ecstatic,\u201d Cuomo told The News. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how excited I was the night before.\u201d Hours later, her life would be changed forever . When the case came to trial last year, Cuomo was shocked to learn that New York state requires vaginal penetration for a rape conviction. The other assaults against Cuomo were criminal and predatory sex charges under the law \u2014 not rape. In a 20-minute interview with The News last week, Cuomo said she was going public in an attempt to urge Albany to ensure that \u201crape is rape.\u201d Cuomo is set to travel to Albany on Tuesday to speak out in favor of a bill by Assemblywoman Aravella Simotas (D-Queens) that would add forced oral and anal sex to the state\u2019s rape statutes. The bill, after being first introduced last year by Simotas in response to the Cuomo case, went nowhere.",

        "article": "He is the shadowy figure who praised Anthony Bosch as \u201cthe best at what he does\u201d when he introduced the steroid supplier to Alex Rodriguez in a Tampa hotel room in July 2010. He was also A-Rod\u2019s bagman, delivering thousands of dollars in cash every month to Bosch in return for the drugs that helped make Rodriguez one of the most feared batters in baseball. And when the Biogenesis scandal erupted in January 2013, the steroid matchmaker allegedly became A-Rod\u2019s muscle, delivering threats of violence intended to keep the founder of the notorious Coral Gables anti-aging clinic silent about Rodriguez\u2019s use of banned drugs. Meet Jorge (Oggi) Velazquez, a 43-year-old South Florida resident who helped Rodriguez obtain testosterone, human growth hormone and other performance-enhancing drugs from 2010 to 2012, according to the report written for Major League Baseball and the MLB Players Association by arbitrator Fredric Horowitz. RELATED: LUPICA: NO EXPLAINING AWAY BOSCH, EVIDENCE Sources familiar with MLB\u2019s Biogenesis investigation, as well as the arbitration report that became public when Rodriguez filed a complaint in Manhattan federal court on Monday seeking to have his 162-game suspension overturned, say Velazquez for years played a major role in helping Rodriguez beat baseball\u2019s drug testing program. He played a big part in Rodriguez\u2019s attempts to control the damage from the Biogenesis scandal, too. \u201cHe was the primary player in terms of transmitting threats\u201d after Bosch agreed to cooperate with MLB\u2019s Biogenesis investigation, one source told the Daily News. RELATED: DIRTY BIG SECRETS: A-ROD LAWSUIT EXPOSES SHADY DEALINGS IN DOPING STORY Velazquez, a former liquor store owner who later operated his own now-defunct anti-aging clinic called the Boca Body Rejuvenation Center, has a criminal record that stretches back more than 20 years and includes arrests on charges of grand theft, drug offenses and burglary. His most recent arrest came on Dec. 10, after a domestic violence incident with his live-in girlfriend. Velazquez was arrested on charges of domestic battery by strangulation and simple battery. Documents from the Miami-Dade State Attorney\u2019s Office say prosecutors dropped the case because the victim refused to cooperate with authorities. Velazquez declined to comment when contacted by the Daily News on Monday, saying he wanted to speak to his attorney and other advisers before issuing a statement. He did not return subsequent phone calls. RELATED: PLAYERS ASSOCIATION SLAMS A-ROD OVER 'BASELESS' LAWSUIT Velazquez had been a Bosch client in 2009 or early 2010, according to the arbitration report, when he introduced the self-styled \u201cbiochemist\u201d to Yuri Sucart, the infamous \u201ccousin\u201d Rodriguez claimed helped him score the steroid that prompted his 2003 positive drug test. Bosch helped Sucart shed weight and address other health issues, in part by providing him with testosterone lozenges known as troches. \u201cSucart added that Rodriguez had also used one and loved it because of its explosive effect,\u201d the report said. Velazquez introduced Bosch to the aging superstar in Rodriguez\u2019s hotel room in July 2010, following the Yankees game with the Rays in Tampa. According to the report, Bosch told Rodriguez that he could develop a drug protocol that could not be detected by testing. RELATED: ON \u201860 MINUTES,\u2019 BOSCH DETAILS DRAWING A-ROD'S BLOOD IN STALL, GETTING DEATH THREATS \u201cVelazquez described Bosch as the best at what he does and said Bosch could provide Rodriguez with everything he needed,\u201d the arbitration report said. Rodriguez agreed to become a Biogenesis client, and Velazquez and Sucart accompanied Bosch later that summer, when the Biogenesis founder traveled to A-Rod\u2019s New York apartment to draw blood from Rodriguez to create a PED program. He was there the following week, too, when Bosch returned to New York to explain the protocol to Rodriguez and Sucart, who would administer the drugs to his famous relative. \u201cVelazquez gave Bosch $8,000-$10,000 in cash for payment, saying the money was from Rodriguez,\u201d the arbitration report said. RELATED: PLAYERS ASSOCIATION RIPS MLB FOR '60 MINUTES' REPORT ON A-ROD The payments continued until late 2012 or early 2013, when Bosch learned that former Biogenesis investor Porter Fischer had stolen notebooks linking Rodriguez and other players to performance-enhancing drugs and planned on sharing them with the Miami New Times. The first call he made was to Velazquez. Velazquez, the arbitration report said, was upset but told Bosch he would take care of the matter. Velazquez later told Bosch that then-A-Rod attorney Roy Black or someone in his office had bought the notebooks from Fischer \u2014 and demanded $10,000 from Bosch to cover the cost of the documents. The Biogenesis scandal, however, continued to explode, and in May 2013, Velazquez arranged for Bosch to meet with Andrew O\u2019Connell, a private investigator working for Rodriguez. O\u2019Connell wanted Bosch to sign a document that said he had never supplied the infielder with banned drugs. Bosch refused, and a few weeks later, he agreed to cooperate with MLB if baseball officials agreed to drop him and his brother from the tortious interference lawsuit MLB had filed against the Biogenesis principals that spring. RELATED: INDEPENDENT TEAMS ALL BUT RULE OUT SIGNING A-ROD DURING MLB SUSPENSION One reason why Bosch agreed to the deal: He feared for his life, and MLB agreed to pay up to $2,400 a day for a security detail. Bosch said he had been the target of a series of disturbing threats, including a text message to a former girlfriend that claimed he would not live to see the end of 2013. In an explosive \u201c60 Minutes\u201d report that aired on Sunday, MLB chief operating officer Rob Manfred told CBS journalist Scott Pelley the threats that came from a \u201cknown associate\u201d Rodriguez were especially disturbing. \u201cI don\u2019t know what Mr. Rodriguez knew,\u201d Manfred said after Pelley asked him if Rodriguez and/or his associates were behind the death threats. \u201cI know that the individual involved has been an associate of Mr. Rodriguez for some time.\u201d Sources say that individual was Velazquez. \u201cHe was the person transmitting the threats,\u201d one source said.",

        "article": "Bryce Harper declined an invitation to participate in this year\u2019s Home Run Derby for understandable reasons, which means Nationals fans won\u2019t have an obvious rooting interest in the event for the 10th time in the team\u2019s 11 seasons. Harper became the first (and still only) Nationals player to participate in the derby in 2013. His 25 home runs this season are the second-most by a Nationals player before the all-star break, and he has three games to match (or break) Alfonso Soriano\u2019s mark of 27 set in 2006. Here\u2019s a year-by-year look at the Nationals\u2019 most prolific first-half home run hitters in team history. Many of these guys were derby worthy. One was not. 2005: Jose Guillen Guillen, who led the Nationals with 24 home runs in their inaugural season, would\u2019ve been the obvious choice to represent D.C. in the derby. Guillen hit 18 home runs before the all-star break. The Nationals\u2019 second-best home run hitter in 2005 (Nick Johnson) finished the year with 15. Vinny Castilla had lost the power that helped him to a third-place finish at the 1998 Home Run Derby at Coors Field. 2006: Alfonso Soriano Soriano hit 27 of his career-high 46 home runs before the break but was not in the home run derby field, which included Jermaine Dye, Troy Glaus and Miguel Tejada among others. Ryan Howard edged David Wright to win the event at Pittsburgh\u2019s PNC Park. 2007: Ryan Zimmerman Zimmerman led the Nats with 11 home runs before the break. He played in every game in 2007 for the only time in his career and finished the year with 24 home runs. 2008: Lastings Milledge (Injury Replacement) Somehow, Zimmerman led the 2008 Nats in home runs in the first half with eight, despite not playing after May 25 with a shoulder injury. Come on down, Mr. Milledge! The former first-round pick of the Mets hit seven home runs before and after the break, tying Zimmerman for the team-high. That\u2019s right, the Nationals\u2019 leading home run hitter for the season hit 14 home runs in 2008. Elijah Dukes and Willie Harris both hit 13, while Ronnie Belliard added 11. Throw in Wily Mo Pena and you\u2019ve got one heck of a derby field. 2009: Adam Dunn The Big Donkey hit 23 of his team-high 38 home runs before the all-star game. 2010: Adam Dunn Dunn hit 38 homers again in 2010, with 22 coming before the break. He never participated in a home run derby. 2011: Michael Morse Morse led the team with 15 home runs at the all-star break en route to a career-high 31. 2012: Adam LaRoche LaRoche hit a team-leading 15 of his 33 home runs in the first half. 2013: Bryce Harper With his father, Ron, serving as his pitcher, Harper finished second to Yoenis Cespedes at New York\u2019s Citi Field. 2014: Ian Desmond Ah, the good old days. Despite a .243 average in the first half, Desmond led the Nats with 16 home runs and 57 RBI. 2015: Bryce Harper Don\u2019t worry. Harper is all in for the 2018 Home Run Derby. Who would win a home run derby featuring the nine players above? Assuming his dad is pitching, I think you\u2019ve got to go with Harper. Scott Allen writes about all things D.C. sports.

        "article": "\u201cI believed in you. I bet on you,\u201d Obama said. \u201cI\u2019ll make that bet any day of the week, and because of that bet, three years later that bet is paying off for America. The American auto industry has come roaring back.\u201d On the campaign trail, Obama has included the bailout in his stump speech in appeals to Rust Belt voters in states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan and, especially, Ohio, where the president has appeared 11 times this year. Democrats are expected to showcase the bailout during their national convention in Charlotte this week, showing a short film that features remarks from United Auto Workers President Bob King, according to the Detroit News. But the tableau in Charlotte is complicated by protests from other unions, who are upset that Democrats chose to have their convention in a right-to-work state that bans collective bargaining agreements that require workers to join unions. Unions have contributed far less money to the convention than in past years, and some workers held an alternative gathering in Philadelphia last month. Some union protests were scheduled for Monday in Charlotte. Still, labor leaders, including King and AFL-CIO chief Richard Trumka, were on-hand to help introduce Obama in Toledo. Last year, Trumka had expressed frustration with Obama for not pushing more strongly for a jobs program, but he grew more supportive after Obama used a Labor Day address last year in Detroit to launch a national tour for a jobs bill in the fall. Trumka delivered a passionate speech Monday criticizing Romney as trying to pit voters against each other in an effort to win the election. \u201cWhat Mitt Romney is doing is wrong,\u201d Trumka said. \u201cThose are not the values I grew up with. What he\u2019s doing is beneath the dignity of the American people and we won\u2019t let him win. There\u2019s something we should do about it . . . We should support President Obama because he supports us.\u201d Vice President Biden hammered the same theme as Obama on Monday, on his third trip in recent weeks to Detroit. He dropped in on the Metro Detroit AFL-CIO Labor Day Rally to again slam Romney\u2019s stance on the auto bailout. \u201cFolks, you can\u2019t say you\u2019re going to create jobs in the United States of America when you\u2019re willing to let 1 million jobs go under with the liquidation of the automobile plants that he suggested,\u201d Biden told about 3,500 union workers, many wearing Tigers ball caps, firefighter helmets or American Federation of Teachers t-shirts. Romney has said Democrats are distorting his position, explaining that he favored a managed bankruptcy and might have offered government aid after such a process was completed. In a statement Monday, Romney said Labor Day is a chance to \u201ccelebrate the strong American work ethic.\u201d But he added that with 23 million Americans unemployed, \u201ctoday is another day of worrying when their next paycheck will come.\u201d Obama also visited a Toledo diner to have breakfast with three auto workers who say the bailout saved their jobs. At the event, Obama recalled his first automobile, a Jeep, as \u201cbright and shiny,\u201d with comfortable seats. At the high school, Obama was greeted by a crowd that chanted, \u201cFired up, ready to go!\u201d and \u201cWe are the 99 percent!\u201d while awaiting the president. Obama, in his remarks, obliquely refered to the battle in Wisconsin where Republican Gov. Scott Walker pushed successfully to limit collective bargaining rights and then won his recall election after union workers sought to remove him from office. \u201cWhen [Republicans] try to pass right-to-work laws, which really mean right-to-work for less and less. . . they hope unions like yours unravel,\u201d the president said. He also used an extended football metaphor to strike back at Romney\u2019s remark two days ago that the country needs \u201ca new coach.\u201d Obama said that on first through third downs, Romney would raise taxes on the middle class, roll back financial reforms and then call a Hail Mary pass by turning Medicare into a voucher system that could raise costs for seniors. \u201cI have one piece of advice,\u201d Obama said. \u201cPunt it away. It won\u2019t work. It won\u2019t win the game. You don\u2019t need that coach. It\u2019s a losing season.\u201d Krissah Thompson also contributed to this story.",

        "article": "A great divide exists in the voting power of shareholders in the United States. The majority of American companies have one share, one vote, but more and more companies are going public with a dual-class stock structure. Here, the voting power rests in the hands of the founders or another group of shareholders. It\u2019s time to consider an alternative: \u201ctenure voting,\u201d a system in which shareholders accumulate more votes the longer they hold stock. Dual-class stock, which must be adopted in the initial public offering stage, is all the rage and is not just found at Google and Facebook. Pure Storage, First Data and Square have all gone public with dual-class stock. Last year, some 13.5 percent of I.P.O.s included some type of dual-class stock, according to Dealogic As I\u2019ve written before, this creates a culture of \u201chaves\u201d and \u201chave-nots.\u201d The haves with dual-class stock are protected from shareholder activism and insulated from shareholder demands. The have-nots are on the run \u2014 in constant fear of demands from activist investors. The difference comes down to the value of a vote. In the case of dual-class stock, either your vote is worth nothing or everything. The founders essentially control the company and wield influence more or less with impunity. This insulates the company from shareholder activism and indeed from the other shareholders. The other shareholders, meanwhile, have worthless votes. The idea can work well in principle. Concentrating voting power with the founders allows them to steer the corporate culture and look to the long term. But there are examples where it has gone horribly awry, as with Sumner Redstone at Viacom and CBS. Mr. Redstone has refused to give up control of the companies despite his apparent ill health at age 92. In the rest of corporate America, shareholders have one vote for every share. This has the same flaws as American democracy. Too often your vote doesn\u2019t count and many shareholders don\u2019t bother to vote. Everyone also has the same kind of voting power, from an index fund that can hold a stock for decades to day traders who care only about the next five minutes. In other words, neither model works in all cases. In addition, this binary world does not reflect an increasingly complicated reality. Today, founders reflexively go about adopting dual-class stock whether it is good or bad for the company. Dual-class stock may work well at Facebook, but whether it does at Fairway Group Holdings, the struggling grocery store chain that appears to be heading for default on its loans, is another story. The one-share, one-vote companies, meanwhile, are vulnerable to being pushed into quick fixes at the expense of the business long term. Activist hedge funds press companies to enact spinoffs, big share buybacks or other financial engineering tricks to generate a pop in the stock price. And then the activists walk away. This can be a real problem. After all, how else can we explain a Rube Goldberg-type transaction like the merger of Dow Chemical and DuPont, to be followed by a split of the combined company into three different ones? Such a complex and potentially risky transaction would not have happened if the two companies had not been pushed by shareholder activists. The charge is heatedly disputed by the activists, who contend that they are simply making companies more efficient. They have a point: Activists have successfully overhauled many staid companies like Darden Restaurants, owner of Olive Garden, where the chief executive was accused of spending several months a year serving on other boards while his own business declined. There is, however, a potential middle ground in shareholder voting \u2014 a system that diverts power from founders while allowing companies to reward longer-term shareholders. Enter tenure voting. In a paper I released this week with David J. Berger and Aaron J. Benjamin of the law firm Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, we outline the potential of this system. In tenure voting, more votes are given to shareholders the longer they hold shares. So for example, if you hold shares for three years at the company you will have three votes per share. The award of more votes for a longer holding period is intended to empower those shareholders who stick with the company. They will presumably have a greater stake in the welfare of the company. It can also provide a counterweight in a dual-class setup. The founders may still have a larger voting bloc, but the power held by long-term institutional investors would grow over time. That would allow some measured shareholder activism, while limiting founder power. The beauty of tenure voting is that it is devised to address short-termism while rewarding all shareholders. Blockchain technology can make it easier to track ownership of everyone\u2019s shares to ensure they are given the right number of votes. (Blockchain technology, which is used by Bitcoin, would create a public ledger of all transactions.) Will long-term shareholders value their new voting power? It is possible that such shareholders may become like sheep, never complaining and never trying to influence the company. They will hold and hold and sell only when the news is very bad. Still, there are some indications that shareholders value the power to vote: Google\u2019s \u201cno vote\u201d shares, for example, trade at a small discount to its one-vote shares. Tenure voting is not a cure-all, to be sure. It may turn out that one share, one vote is best and we should simply reward whoever has the most shares. Yet American companies are in a straitjacket because of the current Wall Street obsession on short-term methods and results. They dare not give shareholders any more voting power if they can help it. Otherwise, though, there are no checks on founders and management. A middle path \u2014 tenure voting \u2014 seems worth trying.

        "article": "Several teams participating in this year\u2019s World Cup have team-wide bans on having sex before games, because coaches believe it could interfere with performance. \u201cThere will be no sex in Brazil,\u201d Safet Susic, the coach of Bosnia-Herzegovina\u2019s national soccer team told reporters. \u201cI am not interested what the other coaches do. This is not a holiday trip, we are there to play football at the World Cup.\u201d Abstinence is not a phenomenon reserved for the World Cup; several Olympic teams have taken temporary vows of celibacy during the games (though that has not stopped Olympic villages from running out of thousands of condoms). It\u2019s even reported that boxer Muhammad Ali refused to have sex six weeks before a match. However, there\u2019s a lack of evidence proving sex makes people worse\u2014or better\u2014at sports. \u201cIt\u2019s often talked about, but it has not been shown to be true,\u201d says sports medicine physician Dr. Jordan Metzel. \u201cThere are lots of factors that could account for how a player performs.\u201d For instance, doing the deed can take time away from getting enough shuteye, and getting enough sleep is non-negotiable for peak performance. (French players are allowed to have sex, but \u201cnot all night,\u201d the team\u2019s former doctor told 20Minutes.fr) The authors of a 2000 study note that former New York Yankees manager Casey Stengel once said: \u201cIt\u2019s not the sex that wrecks these guys, it\u2019s staying up all night looking for it.\u201d There have been few studies looking specifically at sex and athletic performance but results were inconclusive. For example, a mid-90s study looked at the effects of sex on measures like aerobic power and oxygen pulse among 11 men running on treadmills. The men were tested twice, once having sex 12 hours before and once without sex. Putting aside the fact that it was a very small sample size with limited testing, the data came back showing the results from both experiments were no different. Another review of 31 studies on sex and athletics published in the Clinical Journal of Sports Medicine found weak evidence that having sex the night before competition affects performance. Exhaustion cannot be a great factor since most sexual intercourse burns only 25\u201350 calories\u2014the equivalent of walking up two flights of stairs. The authors of that research conclude that it likely just depends on the person. Some may feel that sex helps them relieve anxiety, while for others it becomes a distraction. There\u2019s also the possibility that sex during major athletic events leads to distractions. Some teams, like Nigeria, only allow players to have sex with their wives. Perhaps it\u2019s because the hook-up scene can becoming distracting. \u201cThere was a point where I had to be like OK, this is way too distracting. I deleted my [Tinder] account to focus on the Olympics,\u201dAmerican snowboarder Jamie Anderson told reporters. However, no studies have looked at the psychological effects of having sex before a game and whether athletes believe sex helps or harms them, which may be more important. \u201cIn sports, people have all kinds of theories, even if it\u2019s not medically substantiated. For instance: compression gear for speed and titanium necklaces for performance,\u201d says Dr. Metzel. \u201cWe don\u2019t have scientific evidence to back those claims, but if players think abstaining from sex helps them, it may give them a psychological edge.\u201d Many athletes have pre-game rituals, or lucky tokens, and some research has shown that these superstitions actually improve performance. So perhaps a team sex-ban technically isn\u2019t doing much for performance on the field, but when it comes to getting in the right mindset, it\u2019s not out of the question that it could make all the difference for some players.",

        "article": "Washington (CNN) \u2013 President Obama was wrong when he promised, \"If you like your health insurance, you can keep it.\" But lawmakers promising legislation to reinstate some of those plans cancelled because of the Affordable Care Act might be making an equally hollow promise. Follow @politicalticker Follow @AdamATCNN There are multiple proposals on Capitol Hill aiming to fix this broken promise of Obamacare. But even if Congress can come together to pass a bill that would help the president keep his pledge, there's little indication it would have any immediate effect on those cancelled insurance plans. One proposal introduced by Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-Louisiana, would require insurance companies to continue offering plans so long as customers stayed up to date with their payments. Another put forward by Rep. Fred Upton, R-Michigan, would give health insurance companies the option to continue offering plans currently available on the individual market, while also allowing customers to continue to enroll in those plans. Republicans in the House of Representatives plan to hold a vote on Rep. Upton's proposal on Friday. Robert Zirkelbach, a spokesman for the trade association America's Health Insurance Plans, says both of these proposals leave many questions unanswered. \"Health insurance is regulated at a state level,\" Zirkelbach said. Any federal mandate to offer certain insurance plans - or even a law allowing companies to continue plans - may contradict decisions by state regulators. Reconciling these contradictions would complicate any proposal to address these problems, Zirkelbach said. And requiring companies to continue to offer certain plans, as Sen. Landrieu's proposal would do, would be \"incredibly disruptive.\" \"Health plans can't arbitrarily decide what coverage they want to offer in a marketplace,\" he said. \"Health insurance is regulated at a state level. States' rules determine what health insurance companies can offer.\" The state-level approval process can take several months, and health care industry advisor Robert Laszewski told NPR on Tuesday that it's too late for insurers to change their offerings. \"It's not at all feasible,\" Laszweski told NPR, because companies have spent much of the past year preparing for the new regulations under the Affordable Care Act, and all of the plans that kick in on January 1 have undergone a thorough rate review process with state regulators where they're available. \"Even if you decide to go 'never mind' about all these cancellations, how is the insurance company going to send out letters to all these people within the space of a couple of weeks, rejigger all of their computer systems that took months to redo in the first place, and get these people to decide whether they want to try for Obamacare, which is the only place they can get subsidies, or try to stay on their own policies?\" Laszewski asked.",

        "article": "JERUSALEM \u2014 The prime minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, stood firm Friday on his government\u2019s policy of continued building in East Jerusalem, a major point of contention with the Obama administration. His office said the policy remained unchanged. The prime minister then met for about five hours with his top ministers to discuss the government\u2019s next moves, but there was no indication that the differences with the United States had been resolved. Also Friday, an Israeli officer and a soldier were killed in a clash with Palestinian militants along the Gaza border, the Israeli military said. The military said two of the Palestinians were also killed. Hamas, the Islamic group that controls Gaza, said in a statement that its gunmen had confronted an Israeli force that crossed into the Palestinian territory east of Khan Yunis, and that it did so for purposes of defense. According to the military, the Palestinian fighters were planting explosives along the border fence. A Palestinian doctor at a Khan Yunis hospital said two Palestinian civilians were also wounded in the ensuing clashes, one of them a boy aged 10. Hamas declared a unilateral cease-fire at the end of Israel\u2019s three-week military offensive in Gaza in January 2009. The border, while relatively quiet since then, remains volatile. There was no immediate statement from the Israeli government after the lengthy cabinet meeting. But the Israeli defense minister, Ehud Barak, said in an interview on Channel 2 news on Friday night that there were still differences with the United States. Mr. Barak, who leads the center-left Labor Party that sits in the coalition, said Israel could agree to some of the American requests for steps to enable the start of indirect Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. But he said there were others that the ministers did not agree to, and that there was an uneasy feeling around the cabinet table that the American demands would only serve to harden Palestinian positions. Mr. Netanyahu convened his senior cabinet ministers, known as the Forum of Seven, a day after he returned from Washington. In hours of talks with President Barack Obama, he failed to reach agreement on curbing construction in the contested territory of East Jerusalem. At home, the prime minister appeared to be struggling to reach consensus within his own government on how to respond to American requests for confidence-building gestures toward the Palestinians, how to move forward with peace-making while holding together his mostly right-leaning coalition. Some Israeli commentators predicted that might prove impossible. \u201cIt is politics time now,\u201d wrote Ben Caspit in Friday\u2019s Maariv newspaper. \u201cEven if the magic formulas are found that will make it possible to square the circle and keep bumbling on, Benjamin Netanyahu knows that he is on a collision course.\u201d Mr. Netanyahu could change the composition of his ruling coalition by inviting the centrist Kadima party, led by former Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni, to join him in a unity government. Yohanan Plesner, a Kadima parliamentarian, told Army Radio here on Friday that his party would consider joining the government provided it formulated a new program, but that it would not come in on the right-wing parties\u2019 terms. As rightist politicians urged Mr. Netanyahu not to cave in to American pressure, senior aides of the prime minister said the policy of building in Jerusalem was not a matter of catering to the government\u2019s right flank \u2014 Avigdor Lieberman\u2019s Yisrael Beiteinu party and the ultra-Orthodox Shas, led by Eli Yishai \u2014 but was a continuation of the policy of all Israeli governments since 1967. \u201cThe prime minister\u2019s commitment to Jerusalem is not less than that of anyone else in the cabinet,\u201d a senior official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the issue. Israel annexed East Jerusalem soon after capturing it from Jordan in the 1967 war and views the entire city as its sovereign capital. But the annexation was never internationally recognized, and the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state. Some Israeli officials have suggested a compromise formula that would include a commitment to build only in the post-1967 Jewish neighborhoods of East Jerusalem, not in the Arab-populated ones. Mr. Netanyahu has also set up a committee to work on improving government control over the planning and approval processes for construction there. An Interior Ministry announcement of plans for 1,600 new apartments in Ramat Shlomo, an ultra-Orthodox neighborhood of East Jerusalem, upset a visit here earlier this month by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., infuriated the Obama administration and threw a spotlight on the issue. The Israelis have proposed some gestures to ease the way back to peace talks, including releasing some Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails and loosening restrictions on the entry of goods into Hamas-run Gaza. But if pushed to make too far reaching concessions, some observers warned, Mr. Netanyahu could also face a rebellion within his own conservative-leaning party, Likud. In a hard-hitting interview published in Friday\u2019s Yediot Aharonot newspaper, Moshe Yaalon, a Likud minister and one of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s inner circle, said, \u201cNobody in the Forum of Seven thinks that we can reach an agreement with the Palestinians.\u201d He added that based on recent experience, he would not be willing to divide the land to make way for a Palestinian state.

        "article": "ORLANDO, Fla. \u2014 Thirteen people were criminally charged on Wednesday with hazing in the death of a Florida A&M University marching band member who was beaten after a football game last fall. Of those charged in the death of the band member, Robert Champion, 11 were charged with felonies and 2 with misdemeanors, said Lawson Lamar, the state attorney for the Ninth Judicial Circuit of Florida, in a news conference here. More than 20 people will also face misdemeanor charges in the hazing of other students at Florida A&M, he said. The Champion case is one of the largest criminal cases ever built on a hazing death, legal experts say. Prosecutors would not say whether all of the suspects are fellow students. \u201cHazing is something that will continue to happen out of sight until a student like Robert Champion pays the ultimate price,\u201d Mr. Lamar said. Police officers across the state are working to arrest the suspects, who have not been identified. A charge of felony hazing carries up to six years in prison. The case, which turned a national spotlight on hazing within elite marching bands, grew out of a beating that Mr. Champion, 26, received in Orlando on Nov. 19 after a football game against a rival school, Bethune-Cookman University. Prosecutors said Mr. Champion was beaten, kicked and suffocated by fellow band members during a hazing ritual aboard a bus. Under a tradition known as \u201cCrossing Bus C,\u201d students would walk down the aisle of the bus while classmates punched them. Mr. Champion was found lifeless on the bus and pronounced dead at a hospital. Florida passed a strict antihazing law in 2005 after a college student drowned during a fraternity event. The law makes it easier for prosecutors to treat hazing as a felony. The Champion family had hoped for the state to bring murder or manslaughter charges, said their lawyer, Christopher M. Chestnut. \u201cThis is bittersweet for them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were hoping for more severe charges.\u201d That would have been a legal challenge, said George R. Dekle, a law professor at the University of Florida. With so many students participating in the hazing, he said, it would be difficult to persuade jurors that one person\u2019s actions caused Mr. Champion\u2019s death, as a murder charge requires. Mr. Chestnut said he planned to sue the university and possibly the band director. The family has already sued the company that owns the bus, saying the driver stood by while hazing took place. The university said in a statement that it was working to prevent another tragedy. It has formed an antihazing committee and designated a $50,000 grant for faculty members to research the nature and extent of hazing on campus. Mr. Champion, a clarinet player from Decatur, Ga., had dreamed since high school of attending Florida A&M, a 13,000-student historically black university in Tallahassee. The school\u2019s famed band, known as the Marching 100, has performed at Super Bowl halftime shows and President Obama\u2019s inauguration. Mr. Champion tried out twice before being selected as one of six drum majors in 2010. His death resulted from \u201cblunt force trauma\u201d that caused hemorrhaging and left deep bruises on his chest, arms, shoulders and back, according to a medical examiner\u2019s report. His parents say he was beaten so severely because he had voiced concerns about the band\u2019s hazing culture. They also say he was bullied because he was gay. Since Mr. Champion\u2019s death, Florida A&M has faced a series of reports of abuse and hazing. In December, three band members were arrested and charged with beating a female classmate so severely that her thigh was broken and she had blood clots in her legs. And last month, two music professors resigned after being accused of participating in hazing fraternity pledges in 2010. The university has suspended the band and said it might not perform during this fall\u2019s football season. The band\u2019s director, Julian White, was initially fired and then placed on paid administrative leave. The case has raised awareness at universities across the country that hazing can bring criminal and legal repercussions, said Susan Lipkins, a psychologist who specializes in college hazing. \u201cIt\u2019s getting more common to see these issues handled in court,\u201d she said. \u201cUniversities have turned a blind eye for a long time. But they can no longer afford to do that.\u201d",

        "article": "IN northern Uganda, the dry season is used to burn bushes; the fire drives snakes and other predators away. On the Ugandan side of the border with South Sudan, below a mountainous ridge along the Nile, is a village called Odrupele by locals. It is a place teeming with snakes. Until a few years ago, children walking along the village\u2019s paths were stalked by a greater threat lurking in the bushes \u2014 possible abduction by members of the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army, whose leader, Joseph Kony, started a brutal campaign in the late 1980s to overthrow Uganda\u2019s government by using child soldiers. The dry season was better; but like serpents, L.R.A. fighters returned with the rains. That cult of fear was immortalized earlier this month when the film \u201cKony 2012\u201d went viral on the Internet. But long before Mr. Kony, people in northern Uganda were preyed upon \u2014 by the armies of King Leopold of Belgium, the dictator Idi Amin, and later Ugandan governments. Violence is an enterprise that does not involve one man or his organization alone, no matter how cruel. The village of Odrupele (also called Dufile), near where I went to primary and secondary school, once served as an inland port for cargoes of ivory and slaves. By a twist of history, Mr. Kony is now in the Democratic Republic of Congo, King Leopold\u2019s old playground, having relocated there in late 2005. Carving his own bloody path with rope, knives and guns, he is surviving on low-tech methods while 100 members of the world\u2019s most advanced army have joined the effort to kill or capture him. While the evil methods of men like Mr. Kony are easily understood by millions, the politics so crucial to sustaining their brutal campaigns are harder to grasp. Mr. Kony sees himself as a liberator and he\u2019s always had allies in unlikely places. Mr. Kony, like other villains in the region who have been indicted for war crimes, has thrived most as an agent of other interests. In the 1990s, he was adopted as a proxy by the Sudanese government in Khartoum, which was then fighting a war with the Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Army in southern Sudan. Uganda supported the S.P.L.A. and considered northern Uganda as collateral in a bigger war. When the two Sudans signed a peace deal in 2005, Mr. Kony\u2019s license almost expired. Campaigns like \u201cKony 2012\u201d aspire to frame the debate about these criminals and inspire action to stop them. Instead, they simply conscript our outrage to advance a specific political agenda \u2014 in this case, increased military action. African leaders, after all, are adept at pursuing their own agendas by using the resources that foreign players inject and the narratives that they prefer \u2014 whether the post-9/11 war on terror or the anti-Kony crusade. And these campaigns succeed by abducting our anger and holding it hostage. Often they replace the fanaticism of evil men with our own arrogance, and, worse, ignorance. Moreover, they blind us by focusing on the agents of evil and not their principals. Mr. Kony has continued to benefit from the patronage of Sudan\u2019s president, Omar Hassan al-Bashir, but even more so from the rivalry between Congo\u2019s president, Joseph Kabila, and the Ugandan president, Yoweri Museveni. That rivalry can be traced to the late 1990s, when Uganda occupied Congo before being forced to finally withdraw in 2003 under international pressure and accusations of plunder and rape. Mr. Kabila has turned a blind eye to the L.R.A. because it serves as a counterweight against Ugandan influence in eastern Congo. Mr. Kony\u2019s relocation to Congo followed many failed attempts to uproot him, including Operation Iron Fist and the establishment of the Ministry for the Pacification of the North. Meanwhile, accusations abounded of members of the Ugandan Army\u2019s top brass enriching themselves, including through the padding of payrolls with dead \u201cghost soldiers,\u201d as billions were spent on defense. A scorched-earth policy that drove Mr. Kony\u2019s victims into camps for \u201cinternally displaced persons\u201d led to thousands of deaths from disease while L.R.A. fighters snaked back during the rainy season, under bush cover, to abduct and kill. When \u201cKony 2012\u201d was shown in northern Uganda, people reacted to it with anger, frustration and fear. Aside from the fact that Mr. Kony was no longer in the country, many Ugandans did not want to be reminded of him. The locals never forgot that Mr. Kony\u2019s nine lives were licensed by the politics of the posse that has been hunting for him. Some northern politicians accused the Ugandan government of criminal negligence or settling old political scores. Others, outraged by the conditions the government had subjected them to, sympathized with Mr. Kony. Most were simply tired of war and supported peace talks to end the conflict. If America backed an ambitious regional political solution instead of a military one, it is quite possible that the L.R.A. and other militant groups would cease to exist. But without such a bargain, the violence won\u2019t end. Killing Mr. Kony may remove him from the battlefield but it will not cure the conditions that have allowed him to thrive for so long.",

        "article": "J. F. terHorst, a reporter who in August 1974 was appointed White House press secretary by an old friend, President Gerald R. Ford, but who resigned less than a month later when Ford granted former President Richard M. Nixon an unconditional pardon in connection with the Watergate scandal, died Wednesday in Asheville, N.C. He was 87. The cause was congestive heart failure, said his son, Peter. Mr. terHorst\u2019s resignation was \u2014 and still is \u2014 considered a rare act of conscience by a high-ranking public official, and the circumstances in which it occurred were extraordinary. He was a veteran newsman, the Washington bureau chief of The Detroit News and a respected member of the White House press corps when he was named press secretary by Ford. He had known Ford since he covered his first Congressional race in 1948 for The Grand Rapids Press, and at the time he was writing his biography. For four weeks reporters credited Mr. terHorst (pronounced terHORST) \u2014 and the new president and his staff \u2014 with restoring openness and honesty to the White House after having dealt with a Nixon administration that they had often felt was deliberately misleading them. The Watergate affair \u2014 the break-in at the offices of the Democratic opposition by a White House team of burglars and the Nixon administration\u2019s attempts to cover up that crime \u2014 had its roots in this culture of suspicion and secretiveness that was fostered by the Nixon White House, and it was still being investigated by an independent prosecutor when Ford took office. Indeed, a number of top administration officials, including Attorney General John N. Mitchell; the White House chief of staff, H. R. Haldeman; and Nixon\u2019s top domestic policy adviser, John D. Ehrlichman; went to prison for Watergate-related crimes. In early September, however, Ford announced that he was pardoning Nixon, saying that to pursue criminal charges against the former president would be detrimental to the interests of the country. Mr. terHorst felt not only that the decision was wrong \u2014 the president should not be held to a different standard of justice than people of a lesser station, he said \u2014 but also that he had been kept in the dark about it, which he said had undermined his credibility. \u201cI cannot in good conscience support your decision to pardon former President Nixon even before he has been charged with the commission of any crime,\u201d Mr. terHorst wrote to Ford in his resignation letter on Sept. 8, 1974. \u201cAs your spokesman, I do not know how I could credibly defend that action in the absence of a like decision to grant absolute pardon to the young men who evaded Vietnam military service as a matter of conscience and the absence of pardons for former aides and associates of Mr. Nixon who have been charged with crimes \u2014 and imprisoned \u2014 stemming from the same Watergate situation.\u201d Jerald Franklin terHorst was born in Grand Rapids, Mich., on July 11, 1922, the son of Dutch immigrants. He did not speak English until he was 5. He dropped out of high school at 15 to work on his uncle\u2019s farm but was eventually persuaded to resume his education by the high school principal. He went on to earn an agriculture scholarship to Michigan State University, where he worked on the school newspaper. Before finishing college, he joined the Marines and served in the Pacific at the end of World War II, then completed his college career at the University of Michigan. After graduating he took a job as a reporter for The Grand Rapids Press. His wife, the former Louise Roth, whom he had met at Michigan State and married in 1945, took a job at the rival paper, The Grand Rapids Herald. He subsequently worked for The Detroit News, first in its Lansing bureau, then in the city room and finally the Washington bureau. The paper granted him a leave of absence to take his White House job, and after his resignation he returned to the paper as a columnist. His book about Ford, \u201cGerald Ford and the Future of the Presidency,\u201d was published at the end of 1974, with an epilogue about Mr. terHorst\u2019s resignation. Ron Nessen, a correspondent for NBC News, succeeded him as White House press secretary. In 1981, Mr. terHorst left journalism to work for the Ford Motor Company as Washington public affairs director. Louise Roth terHorst died last year. In addition to his son, who lives in Asheville, Mr. terHorst is survived by three daughters, Karen Morris, of Decatur, Ga.; Margaret Robinson, of Alexandria, Va.; and Martha Lubin, of St. Petersburg, Fla.; and eight grandchildren. Shortly after his resignation, Mr. terHorst was asked by The New York Times to elaborate on his reasons. \u201cIf justice is to be even-handed and administered to the rich and the poor, the weak and the powerful alike,\u201d he replied, \u201cthen mercy, I thought, when administered by a president who sets the tone for the country, also should be an act of similar kind.\u201d",

But Democrats said Monday they were trying to change that, making their convention in Charlotte, which begins Tuesday, one of the most accessible and inclusive ever. That includes an outdoor party open to the public beginning today, and a speech by the president in a stadium that seats 70,000. If only the weather holds up. The big event of the convention is the president\u2019s speech Thursday evening in Bank of America Stadium, which will be able to fit 65,000 people. Tickets were given to volunteers who promised a certain amount of time to the campaign. Lines to pick up those tickets were a half-mile long at some places, the campaign said. Yet forecasts call for scattered thunderstorms Thursday, which could make for a very unpleasant time, since umbrellas aren\u2019t allowed for security reasons. PHOTOS: The protests of the DNC Convention CEO Steve Kerrigan said the event would go forward \u201crain or shine,\u201d but that the committee was monitoring the forecast daily and had a contingency plan, if need be. \u201cWe want to make sure everyone\u2019s safe,\u201d he said at a morning news conference. Moving the speech inside to a smaller venue would mean the DNC would have to turn away thousands of voters who donated time and money, and in some cases, traveled from neighboring states to attend. \u201cIt will be there rain or shine, obviously if there\u2019s very severe weather, we\u2019d be prepared for that as well,\u201d Obama campaign spokesman Ben LaBolt said. As they did during the 2008 convention, Democrats are hoping to use the Charlotte gathering to recruit volunteers and to influence voters in North Carolina and in neighboring Virginia, LaBolt said. \u201cIn Denver we registered 25,000 volunteers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll do more than that here.\u201d The convention will bring 5,556 delegates and 407 alternates to Charlotte, 27% of whom are African American and 50% of whom are women, said DNC secretary Alice Germond. The oldest delegate, Elzena Johnson, was born in 1914 and the youngest was born in 1994, she said. \u201cYou\u2019ll see people from every walk of life,\u201d she said. Indeed, there are specific convention events for nearly every group one could think of, including Native Americans, Pacific Islanders, people with disabilities, and a vague \u201cEthnic Council,\u201d presumably for people who don\u2019t fit into any other group. The convention will also feature Americans who were helped by the president's policies, including a GM worker who was laid off and then reemployed thanks to the bailout of the auto industry.

This convention is the most open and accessible convention in history.\u201d Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa tried to emphasize the convention\u2019s diversity by giving a quick welcoming speech to the press in Spanish, after his English version.

I was lucky to give birth in New York City, so I didn\u2019t have to worry about whether my child and I would survive. I am grateful to be a maternal health advocate. It\u2019s something that gives me so much back. T.T.: You have a starring role in a film coming out soon called \u201cBlack Gold.\u201d You recently wrapped two other films. Is acting something you are passionate about and want to continue to pursue? L.K.: I love acting! So, yes, I\u2019d like to continue to explore and grow as an actress. I am very excited to discover this part of myself. T.T.: Are there particular actresses you admire? L.K.: I would say Kate Winslet and Cate Blanchett. Those two are magnificent \u2014 from their beauty to their talent. T.T.: You still keep busy modeling. You have had an impressive career. Do you have some special early memories you can share? L.K.: Modeling still excites me. It is a great form of expression for me. I have been lucky enough to work with incredibly talented people. I\u2019ll never forget seeing my first French Vogue cover and spread. Seeing all those images of myself in a magazine like that \u2014 it gave me such a thrill! Another exciting moment was my first American Vogue shoot. It was a big group shot, of all top models, by Steven Meisel. I was in awe. And smitten with the profession. T.T.: What side of you does teaming up with L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris connect to? L.K.: The side that is a believer in individuality and self-confidence. L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris is a great promoter of this and many other great concepts. Our vision about beauty and women is very compatible. They embrace putting out products that enable women to express their own unique beauty. Their taste is modern, the quality is high, and the price is affordable. T.T.: Who is your beauty icon? L.K.: I think Jane Birkin is my favorite. She was creative, fearless and fully embraced her individuality. T.T.: Looking at you, I do not detect makeup, only gorgeous skin. What foundation and concealer do you use? L.K.: I now use the True Match line by L\u2019Or\u00e9al, because it matches my skin tone perfectly and is very blendable. That is one key to a flawless yet natural-looking complexion. T.T.: Plus good skin care helps. What is your regimen? L.K.: Very minimal. I figure, Why mess with a good thing? For me less is more. Products that are gentle and simple, such as Cetaphil, Aveeno or Neutrogena are great. I am not one for facials, either. T.T.: Do you have a favorite salon for blow-outs? L.K.: I can\u2019t give the name away, or else I won\u2019t be able to get in to my standing twice-a-week appointments. It is a Dominican salon in Harlem. They get my hair. T.T.: What hair products work well for your hair? L.K.: I find K\u00e9rastase products work best. They have great hair masks too, for when my hair has been overworked. When I need hair spray, Elnett is No. 1. T.T.: What is your diet and workout philosophy? L.K.: Yoga is my favorite. For my diet, I choose mostly organic. But in general, I am a big believer in trying to strike a balance with everything. T.T.: I\u2019ve always admired your style. What is the most important wardrobe staple for you? L.K.: Jeans! I am all about comfort. T.T.: How about designers? Whose style works for you? L.K.: I tend to gravitate toward Proenza Schouler and Alexander Wang. Their designs are accessible and easy. T.T.: And my favorite question: what are your must-have cosmetics? L.K.: Without a doubt, L\u2019Or\u00e9al Colour Riche Le Gloss in Natural Nude. It makes my lips so soft and adds a hint of shine. And my lashes would be so sad without a coat of Voluminous Mascara, by \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 L\u2019Or\u00e9al! Just as I was about to take Liya\u2019s photo, I rimmed her eyes with L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s Extra Intense Liquid Pencil Eyeliner in black. She looked in the mirror and exclaimed, \u201cI just found another must-have!\u201d This post has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this post mistakenly identified the name of her upcoming film as \"Desert Flower.\" Her next film is \"Black Gold.\"",

        "article": "(BURNS, Ore.)\u2014 One of the last holdouts in the armed takeover of an Oregon wildlife refuge said Thursday the remaining five occupiers will leave if they receive assurances none of them will be arrested. In a video posted on the YouTube channel \u201cDefendYourBase\u201d that the group has been using to issue updates during the nearly 4-week-old siege, a speaker believed to be David Fry said the occupiers have been told by authorities that \u201cout of five people left here, four of us are allowed to leave.\u201d The FBI had no immediate comment on the demand. It has said only that it is trying to \u201cempty the refuge of the armed occupiers in the safest way possible.\u201d The FBI has set up checkpoints around the refuge that was taken over on Jan. 2 by ranchers and others demanding the federal government turn public lands over to local control. The group\u2019s leader, Ammon Bundy, and 10 others have been arrested over the past couple of days, most of them in a traffic stop Tuesday night that erupted in gunfire and left one follower dead. Fry has been posting frequent online updates from the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. In the video, a speaker whose face was not visible said an FBI official told him one of the remaining occupiers faces a felony count of conspiracy to impede federal officers from carrying out their duties through force, intimidation or threats. That\u2019s the same charge 11 people already arrested in connection with the occupation face. The spokesman said he doesn\u2019t think the individual still at the camp should face charges because he had limited involvement in the standoff. \u201cWe are willing to stay here\u201d unless authorities agree not to charge anyone, the voice on the video said. On Wednesday, three other members of an armed group surrendered to authorities after Bundy issued a statement urging his followers to end the standoff. \u201cPlease stand down. Go home and hug your families. This fight is now in the courts,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, Bundy followers gave conflicting accounts of how Robert Finicum, a spokesman for the group, died in the confrontation Tuesday night on a remote highway. One said Finicum charged at FBI agents, who then shot him. A member of the Bundy family said Finicum did nothing to provoke the agents. Raymond Doherty, an Oregon man who said he witnessed the clash, told Portland TV station KOIN that he heard about a half-dozen shots over 12 to 15 seconds and couldn\u2019t see exactly who was shooting. But he added: \u201cI saw them shooting at each other.\u201d FBI agent Greg Bretzing defended the FBI-led operation: \u201cI will say that the armed occupiers were given ample opportunities to leave peacefully.\u201d Finicum\u2019s daughter called him a martyr. \u201cHe loved freedom obviously more than his life,\u201d Challice Finch told Dallas-Fort Worth TV station KXAS. Bundy is the son of Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy, who was involved in a tense 2014 standoff with the government over grazing rights. The group came to the frozen high desert of eastern Oregon to decry what it calls onerous federal land restrictions and to object to the prison sentences of two local ranchers convicted of setting fires. In a criminal complaint unsealed Wednesday, federal authorities said the armed group had explosives and night-vision goggles and was prepared to fight. The charges against Bundy and others say that the refuge\u2019s 16 employees have been prevented from reporting to work because of threats of violence.",

        "article": "While filming in a desolate area of Australia for Animal Planet's \"River Monsters,\" a television crew spotted a man who had become separated from his boat and spent days trapped on a deserted island. (Animal Planet) Temperatures had hit triple digits when the camera crew spotted a sun-soaked man stranded on an island surrounded by rough waters off Australia\u2019s northern coast. Animal Planet host Jeremy Wade and his crew were searching for a rare fish called the Queensland grouper, for a segment for the documentary series \u201cRiver Monsters,\u201d when the man emerged from a cave on an uninhabited island in the Gulf of Carpentaria, some 60 miles from land. The castaway \u2014 dehydrated and disoriented \u2014 heard the engines and ran toward them. He started shouting and then waving for help. \u201cHe immediately came down to the water, and he\u2019s yelling out, \u2018Give me something to drink, give me something to drink,'\u201d Wade said in the segment, which aired on Animal Planet last week. [Three men rescued from remote island after writing \u2018H-E-L-P\u2019 on the sand] The crew members found him in November on the Sir Edward Pellew Group of Islands after they took a turn to find calmer waters for the shoot. \u201cWe first of all saw a cooler on the rocks and then one of us spotted \u2014 so there\u2019s somebody there, there\u2019s somebody there,\u201d Wade said in the segment, adding that the man was \u201cpretty desperate.\u201d The man was identified by the film crew only as Tremine, a hobby fisherman from Borroloola, a tiny town in Australia\u2019s Northern Territory. They estimated he had been alone on the island for more than two days. Upon spotting him, the crew sent a support vessel to bring him back to their boat. Stephen Shearman, the episode\u2019s director, told The Washington Post that the man told the crew members: \u201cYou\u2019re a lifesaver, you\u2019re a lifesaver!\u201d \u201cI was up in here and down here because I seen turtle nests and heaps of empty bottles,\u201d Tremine told the \u201cRiver Monsters\u201d crew moments after his rescue. \u201cSo I was hoping that one of the bottles might have a bit of water in it. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t see no water in it.\u201d Shearman said he told crew members that he had been \u201cpreparing to die.\u201d \u201cHe had said his last prayer,\u201d Shearman told \u201cInside Edition.\u201d \u201cHe was prepared to die and meet his maker.\u201d [Haunted by cannibalism: \u2018I will never forget that first incision\u2019] Tremine had gone fishing in the Barranyi (North Island) National Park and left his boat behind to scout out a beach nearby, Shearman said. \u201cAfter an hour, he reached a beach, which he didn\u2019t recognize,\u201d Shearman told The Post in an email. \u201cHe tried to walk back but the effects of heat stroke had begun to take a toll on him and he was disoriented. \u201cHe set out again but was beaten back by the sun. He then decided to spend the night on the beach. The next morning, he was swinging from freezing to over-heating \u2014 classic heat stroke symptoms.\u201d Shearman said Tremine told them he tried to eat some oysters, but couldn\u2019t keep them down. \u201cHe spent the whole of the second day and second night in a small cave,\u201d he said. \u201cThe morning of the third day is when we discovered him.\u201d In the \u201cRiver Monsters\u201d segment, Tremine was seen sweating and sipping water on the film crew\u2019s boat. They gave him water and rehydration tablets, Shearman said, but he immediately threw them back up. [The wondrous survival of a 72-year-old woman and her dog, lost 9 days in the Western wilderness] Shearman said the crew members took Tremine to their lodge to rest, and the next day he went home. \u201cI remember that evening when we were all back in the lodge how quiet he was \u2014 just kept shaking his head,\u201d Shearman said. \u201cHis life hung by the thinnest of threads.\u201d \u201cRiver Monsters\u201d airs on Animal Planet at 10 p.m. EDT on Thursdays.

Favorite show of all time, and why? \u201cThe Adventures of Robin Hood,\u201d starring Richard Greene. I wish I had a sexier answer for you, but I don\u2019t. I was more passionate about that show than any other among television\u2019s offerings. In my childhood home our set picked up two channels. So we took what we could get. Because of that I watched more \u201cLove Boat\u201d than is good for a young man. But at 5 p.m. in the afternoon, \u201cThe Adventures of Robin Hood\u201d came on, and I saw the world I was meant to be a part of. It cultivated my taste for the medieval. Even now, when I see a Tudor home in the New Jersey suburbs I instinctively reach into my quiver for an arrow that isn\u2019t there. Favorite show right now, and why? \u201cLouie\u201d is a favorite. I\u2019m generally on the lookout for people/characters/strangers-on-the-subway who successfully represent the pain and possibility of post-divorce life. Louis C.K. has done good work for me in this regard. After the end of a first marriage, it\u2019s all different. Parenting changes. Sex changes. You\u2019re a little older and a little younger at the same time. Not everyone seems to know this. Louie does. And with Steven Wright\u2019s occasional involvement, a cherry is added to the sundae of the creator\u2019s vision of single parenthood. Favorite bad TV, and why? I\u2019m reluctant to say that \u201cGilligan\u2019s Island\u201d is bad TV, but only because it meant so much to me growing up (and what would the show\u2019s poor quality suggest about me, if indeed I was among the show\u2019s most dedicated viewers?). So what was I drawn to? It may have been that the obviously insular nature of that community \u2014 they were on an island, for God\u2019s sake \u2013 reflected what I was dealing with at home. My family was the island I couldn\u2019t leave, and I was their Gilligan. I kept looking for ways off the island, but every morning I found my brother in the hammock below mine. What\u2019s at the top of your Have-To-Watch list? \u201cThe Leftovers.\u201d I\u2019ve read several of Tom Perrotta\u2019s novels and have great appreciation for the darkness and the humor therein, particularly when the two come together as gracefully as they often do. He\u2019s a sensitive writer. His involvement is enough to push that show to the top of my Have-To-Watch list. Which show\u2019s world would you want to live inside? I\u2019d like to live in the world of \u201cMad Men,\u201d if only so that I can track down Don Draper and shake some sense into him. I found myself surprised that I kept going back for more with the \u201cMad Men\u201d series. Draper is so wooden, and his issues so unchanging. The only personal growth I saw was in the man\u2019s bank account. A few episodes in, I understood that he couldn\u2019t keep his tallywacker to himself \u2014 so what kept me watching? There was some repetition compulsion that kept both of us going, I guess. But maybe that\u2019s what marks the whole of my experience with television.",

        "article": "Mortimer B. Zuckerman, the longtime owner of The Daily News in New York, is exploring the possibility of selling the newspaper, opening a new chapter for a nearly century-old publication that has struggled amid changes buffeting the industry. In a memorandum to the staff on Thursday, Mr. Zuckerman said that he was approached recently about selling The News, which he has owned since 1993. \u201cAlthough there were no immediate plans to consider a sale, we thought it would be prudent to explore the possibility,\u201d he wrote. To that end, he added, he has retained the financial advisory firm Lazard. \u201cI have not come to this decision easily,\u201d Mr. Zuckerman, 77, said. He said he believed \u201cthe immense hard work in turning the business around in an extremely challenging period for the industry\u201d had put the newspaper in as strong a position as it had ever been, particularly online. A spokesman for the newspaper declined to make Mr. Zuckerman or any Daily News executives available for interviews, or to comment further on the memo. Lazard also declined to comment. At its peak, The News had a circulation in the millions, and along with its tabloid rival, The New York Post, helped set the pulse for the city. Its provocative, colorful coverage was pored over both in lavish Manhattan apartments and the delivery trucks outside them. But both The News and The Post have been hit hard by sharp declines in advertising, the rise of online outlets and dwindling newsstand sales across the industry. The bread and butter of the New York tabloids \u2014 gossip, sports, provocative photographs \u2014 is now available instantly and without cost to most of the city\u2019s residents on their smartphones. The News\u2019s print and digital circulation was 427,452 on weekdays and 558,057 on Sundays for the six months ending in September, the most recent figures available, according to the Alliance for Audited Media. The Post had a circulation of 497,878 during the week and 454,007 on Sunday, by the same measure. Word of a potential sale was greeted with resignation in the paper\u2019s newsroom, said one staff member who did not want to be named discussing a delicate matter. Reporters and editors have already been strained by cutbacks as the paper tried to adapt to a changed marketplace, and recently went through another round of staff reductions. There had long been speculation that Mr. Zuckerman, who made a fortune in real estate estimated in the billions, wanted to sell The News, or even come to a joint operating agreement with The Post, owned by Rupert Murdoch, the executive chairman of News Corporation. The Post and The News have, in recent years, talked at length about such an agreement, according to two people with knowledge of the discussions, who declined to be named outlining confidential matters. The reason for the collapse of the talks is disputed. As news of Mr. Zuckerman\u2019s intentions spread, there were suggestions online that Mr. Murdoch, known to be passionate about muckraking tabloid newspapers, might even buy The News. But two people with knowledge of internal discussions, who declined to be named because they were not permitted to reveal the information publicly, said Mr. Murdoch was not the potential buyer who had prompted Mr. Zuckerman to explore a sale. The purchase would likely raise regulatory and other issues for News Corporation. Martin Dunn, who edited The News twice, most recently during a seven-year stint that ended in 2010, said he was initially shocked to hear that Mr. Zuckerman was exploring a sale. But he added: \u201cMort has always like to have a seat at the political influence table in New York, and The Daily News had provided that. Obviously as circulations have declined over the years, that influence has declined too.\u201d Correction: February 26, 2015 An earlier version of this article misstated the time frame for the circulation figures for the Daily News and The Post. They represented the period ending September 2013, not 2014. The figures now cited in the article cover the six months ending September 2014.

        "article": "Updated SEP 05, 2014 2:50a ET SAN ANTONIO -- Nick Wilson is off to a fast start for the Arizona Wildcats. The freshman ran for 174 yards on 30 carries, and his go-ahead touchdown changed the momentum in Arizona's 26-23 victory over Texas-San Antonio on Thursday night. Wilson gave Arizona a 20-16 lead with a 2-yard run with 26 seconds left in the first half. \"Every touchdown, every score, every point helps,\" said Wilson, who ran for 104 yards on seven carries last week in the Wildcats' season-opening victory over against UNLV. \"We definitely had momentum going into the locker room. We made a few adjustments and a few changes and we pulled the win out.\" Cayleb Jones had an 85-yard scoring reception for Arizona on the first play from scrimmage, and redshirt freshman Anu Solomon was 17 of 32 for 231 yards after throwing for 425 yards and four touchdowns against UNLV. UTSA coach Larry Coker, who started the school's program in 2011 after his national-title stint at Miami, thought Arizona's touchdown at the end of the half changed the game. \"We had momentum, and they had that last score in the first half and got it back,\" Coker said. \"If we had gone in ahead like we were, it could have changed the outcome. It was a very key time in the football game.\" Casey Skowron made four field goals, converting from 44 and 28 yards in the third quarter to make it 26-16. \"We settled for way too many field goals and didn't execute down in the red zone,\" Wildcats coach Rich Rodriguez said. \"There are so many things we need to clean up and get better at. But I didn't see anyone lose their poise. We took their best shot.\" The Roadrunners, coming off a 20-point victory in their opener at Houston, pulled within three on David Glasco II's 3-yard run midway through the fourth quarter. Arizona intercepted two of Tucker Carter's passes in the final 1 1/2 minutes to seal the game, though the final pick-off was nullified by a penalty. The Wildcats had 452 yards of offense after setting a school record with 787 yards against UNLV It looked as if it would be another blowout shortly after the opening kickoff. On the next play, Solomon flared a conservative sideline pass at Jones close to Arizona's 30. Jones eluded a tackle and scored on the 85-yarder 18 seconds into the game. Jones was back in his home state after sitting out last season following his transfer from Texas. In Austin, he received a two-year probated sentence for misdemeanor assault for punching a Longhorns tennis player in 2013. Jones caught four passes for 143 yards. He caught two passes in 10 games for Texas. Arizona scored on the next possession as well after holding UTSA to three plays and a punt. The Wildcats got inside the 20 before Solomon was sacked by defensive tackle Ferrington Macon, which brought out Skowron for a 38-yard field goal and a 10-0 lead less than 5 minutes into the game. UTSA responded by going 85 yards for a touchdown, using 11 plays and 5 minutes off the clock just before the end of the first quarter. Carter, who ran twice during the drive for 28 yards, got the Roadrunners on the board with a 10-yard scoring completion to tight end David Morgan II. Carter finished with 228 yards and a TD on 22-of-33 passing. After giving up Skowron's 23-yard field goal, the Roadrunners took a 14-13 lead on Kam Jones' 18-yard run. It went to 16-13 with 4:43 before halftime when the spread-offense deep snap was high to Solomon, who scooped up the loose ball in his own end zone and was chased out of the end zone for a safety.",

        "article": "For anyone who has ever been told by a smarty-pants 7-year-old, \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as Brontosaurus; it\u2019s called Apatosaurus\u201d \u2014 it is payback time. \u201cWe have good evidence now for the resurrection of Brontosaurus,\u201d Emanuel Tschopp, a paleontologist with the New University of Lisbon, said on Tuesday. He was referring to the name, not to the creature itself, of course, and to an exhaustive study of 80 or so fossils in a group of long-necked giants called the Diplodocidae, familiar from natural history museums the world over. These plant-eaters grew to lengths of more than 100 feet and weighed thousands of pounds, and it is thought they could crack their long tails like bullwhips, creating sonic booms to scare away predators. The name Brontosaurus was first used in the late 1800s to describe fossils of a dinosaur now on display at the Yale Peabody Museum, but by 1905 it had been reclassified as Apatosaurus, because it was so similar to another sauropod dinosaur of that name. Dr. Tschopp and his colleagues Oct\u00e1vio Mateus at the New University and Roger B. J. Benson at the University of Oxford in England decided that although Brontosaurus and Apatosaurus are similar, there are actually two different genera and the Yale specimen is really a Brontosaurus after all. So are several other museum specimens, they said, including one at the University of Wyoming, and a baby Apatosaurus at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh. Their paper, released online on Tuesday in the journal PeerJ, with all of its nearly 300 pages freely available to anyone, will not be the last word on whether the Brontosaurus name should come back into scientific use. Names of species and genera are matters of expert opinion. There is no national or international board of official dinosaur names that decides who is right. \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting to me is that Brontosaurus and Apatosaurus are still extremely close,\u201d said Matthew T. Carrano, a curator at the Smithsonian Institution\u2019s National Museum of Natural History. \u201cThis provides a lot of new information for the argument, but the argument will continue.\u201d Dr. Tschopp and his colleagues looked at 477 distinct traits that could be identified on the fossil bones and then analyzed them in several ways to look for differences. Dr. Benson said they set a standard based on the differences between two well-known species of similar long-necked dinosaurs, Diplodocus and Barosaurus. \u201cBrontosaurus is at least as different from Apatosaurus as Diplodocus is from Barosaurus,\u201d he said. Dr. Benson pointed out that \u201cthe names are just handles\u201d that help scientists study how life evolves into different forms. Most of the differences are highly technical and noticeable only to anatomists, said Dr. Tschopp. To pick one understandable example, he said, \u201cApatosaurus has a relatively wider neck than Brontosaurus.\u201d But it is the number of differences that is important, he said. Jeffrey A. Wilson, a paleontologist at the University of Michigan, said that he did not have a position on whether the name should be resurrected but that he found the criteria for distinguishing between Apatosaurus and Brontosaurus arbitrary. It was a matter of judgment that involved deciding how different was different enough to justify two distinct genera. \u201cIt\u2019s as if they had a pizza,\u201d he said, and \u201ccut it in six pieces.\u201d Why not cut it into four pieces? he asked. The name game is played not only by scientists. There are pitfalls for parents and children doing their obligatory museum visits. The Apatosaurus on display at the American Museum of Natural History is probably still an Apatosaurus, said Dr. Tschopp, as is the adult skeleton at the Carnegie Museum. In the end, it may be too complicated for parents to remember which is which. So the 7-year-olds may continue to rule.

        "article": "Tennessee Lt. Gov. Ron Ramsey, lagging in polls in the Republican gubernatorial primary race, according to Talking Points Memo, says he's not sure if Constitutional guarantees of freedom of religion apply to Islam, since, he says, Islam may be a cult, not actually a religion. Now, you could even argue whether being a Muslim is actually a religion, or is it a nationality, way of life, cult whatever you want to call it. Ramsey did not dispute the video of his remarks posted at TPM and answered its request for comment with an email: My concern is that far too much of Islam has come to resemble a violent political philosophy more than peace-loving religion. It's time for American Muslims who love this country to publicly renounce violent jihadism and to drum those who seek to do America harm out of their faith community. So, are the vast majority of U.S. pastors who would never dream of burning a Quran going to call out the Dove World Outreach Center? That's the Florida church, which calls itself \"a New Testament, Charismatic, Non-Denominational Church that believes in the whole Bible,\" which posted a roadside sign this month, \"Islam is of the Devil\" and has now stepped up its campaign against Islam. According to Religion News Service, the church is planning \"International Burn A Quran Day,\" on the ninth anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks this year -- smack during Eid al-Fitr, the Islamic feast days at the conclusion of the Ramadan fast. The Friendly Atheist blogger Hemant Mehta called up Jones to ask what's behind the burn. Jones tells him this is not about hate but about Christian truth -- and bringing Muslims to convert. Says Jones: We love the Moslems and hope that they would come to true salvation. What we are attacking is Islam, the religion, and Sharia law, the political system. Brent Michael Dykes, blogging at Yahoo's The Upshot, observes Christians might be surprised to discover the Quran mentions Jesus 25 times and considers him a prophet, great spiritual leader and teacher. This also adds fuel to the anti-Islamic fires evident at mosque-building protests in New York this month. And Ramsey may have been playing to the crowd opposing a new Islamic center planned for Murfreesboro, Tenn., according to TPM. Is hate a way to show love? Do you think anyone will be drawn to accept Jones' version of Christianity? Should the government be evaluating the validity of religions? NOTE: All views, respectfully presented, are welcome.

        "article": "Peter DaSilva for The New York Times Expectations of intensity \u00e2\u0080\u0094 all while having fun \u00e2\u0080\u0094 are found throughout the Googleplex. Blaise Pabon, an engineer, uses a bicycle to dart among the company's buildings. More Photos \u00bb MAYBE it\u2019s no surprise that a yellow-brick road winds through the Googleplex. Step onto Google\u2019s campus here \u2014 with its indoor treehouse, volleyball court, apiaries, heated toilet seats and, yes, Oz-style road \u2014 and you might think you\u2019ve just sailed over the rainbow. But all the toys and perks belie the frenetic pace here, and many employees acknowledge that life at Google can be hard on fragile egos. Sure, the amenities are seductive, says Blaise Pabon, an enterprise sales engineer, but \u201cwhen you get to a place like this, it can tear you apart\u201d if you don\u2019t find a way to handle the hard-driving culture. Employees coming from fast-paced fields, already accustomed to demanding bosses and long hours, say Google pushes them to produce at a pace even faster than they could have imagined. Google\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, Larry Page, recently promised on the company Web site to maintain \u201ca healthy disregard for the impossible.\u201d Little wonder, then, that among the hundreds of free classes that Google offers to employees here, one of the most popular is called S.I.Y., for \u201cSearch Inside Yourself.\u201d It is the brainchild of Chade-Meng Tan, 41, a tall, thin, soft-spoken engineer who arrived at Google in 2000 as Employee No. 107. Think of S.I.Y. as the Zen of Google. Mr. Tan dreamed up the course and refined it with the help of nine experts in the use of mindfulness at work. And in a time when Google has come under new scrutiny from European and United States regulators over privacy and other issues, a class in mindfulness might be a very good thing. The class has three steps: attention training, self-knowledge and self-mastery, and the creation of useful mental habits. If it sounds a bit touchy-feely, consider this: More than 1,000 Google employees have taken the class, and there\u2019s a waiting list of 30 when it\u2019s offered, four times a year. The class accepts 60 people and runs seven weeks. Richard Fernandez, director of executive development and a psychologist by training, says he sees a significant difference in his work behavior since taking the class. \u201cI\u2019m definitely much more resilient as a leader,\u201d he says. \u201cI listen more carefully and with less reactivity in high-stakes meetings. I work with a lot of senior executives who can be very demanding, but that doesn\u2019t faze me anymore. It\u2019s almost an emotional and mental bank account. I\u2019ve now got much more of a buffer there.\u201d Mr. Tan says the course has received good reviews. \u201cIn anonymous surveys, on average, participants rated it around 4.75 out of 5,\u201d he says. \u201cAwareness is spread almost entirely by word-of-mouth by alumni, and that alone already created more demand than we can currently serve.\u201d Mr. Tan\u2019s first book, \u201cSearch Inside Yourself: The Unexpected Path to Achieving Success, Happiness (and World Peace),\u201d is out this month, with a foreword by his friend and S.I.Y. collaborator Daniel Goleman, author of \u201cEmotional Intelligence.\u201d In addition to its United States publication by HarperOne, the book is to be published in 17 markets worldwide, from South Korea to Brazil to Slovenia. \u201cAs technology pushes us faster, we have to adapt to new ways of doing business in this new millennium,\u201d says Mark Tauber, senior vice president and publisher at HarperOne. \u201cWe believe that Meng\u2019s book lays the groundwork for a new national conversation about work and what work means to us.\u201d But what is Mr. Tan\u2019s ultimate goal? A Buddhist for many years, he says without irony that he wants to create world peace. \u201cI was always very different from the other kids,\u201d he says. \u201cI have an I.Q. of 156. I didn\u2019t play sports. I thought big. I thought I could achieve great things. I don\u2019t want to sound megalomaniac, but my whole life is about doing something for the world, from as far back as I can remember.\u201d Born and raised in Singapore, Mr. Tan describes his childhood as \u201cvery unhappy.\u201d",

        "article": "The New York City Ballet principal Wendy Whelan lives with her husband, David Michalek, on a skinny stretch of the Upper West Side that\u2019s known among insiders as the dance belt. Since coming to Manhattan from Louisville more than 30 years ago to train at the School of American Ballet, Ms. Whelan has moved from rental to rental but has never moved out of the neighborhood. The rent-stabilized prewar apartment that\u2019s been home for the past 20 years represented some significant firsts for the dancer: it was her first elevator building and it was her first experience living with a boyfriend. \u201cA good friend of his was a real estate agent \u2014 he showed us this thing and somehow we got it,\u201d Ms. Whelan, 46, said. \u201cIt was just crazy \u2014 two bedrooms, two bathrooms, tons of light, an elevator. It was unbeatable.\u201d The elevator was and is great \u2014 especially since Ms. Whelan\u2019s recent surgery for a hip labral tear sentenced her to two months on crutches. The boyfriend? Well, as it turned out the guy wasn\u2019t a keeper. \u201cBut the apartment was,\u201d the very down-to-earth Ms. Whelan said with a laugh. \u201cI was ready to give it up, but I guess because I was the one who was sort of broken up with, my ex-boyfriend would have probably felt bad if he got the apartment, too.\u201d \u201cI got the best of the bargain,\u201d Ms. Whelan added impishly. \u201cBecause soon after that, I connected with my husband.\u201d The two met at a photo shoot when Mr. Michalek, an artist, was taking publicity shots of Ms. Whelan for a movie version of \u201cThe Nutcracker.\u201d He moved into the apartment a year before the couple\u2019s 2005 wedding, piling his many books on the living floor \u2014 \u201cI danced around them,\u201d Ms. Whelan said \u2014 and suddenly, everything started to hum. \u201cHe made the apartment his canvas,\u201d she recalled. \u201cAnd he really made an interesting space for us. I love living here.\u201d Mr. Michalek stripped and refinished the wood floors, got rid of the picture moldings, built a high bookshelf along the hall leading to a bedroom-turned-office, and then designed the elegant ladder to reach it. He knocked down the wall between the small dark galley kitchen and the small dark dining room, creating a bright inviting entertainment space. Mr. Michalek also spearheaded the renovation of the kitchen. \u201cHe said he could do it for not a lot of money,\u201d said Ms. Whelan, mindful that this was, after all, a rental. \u201cBecause he was an artist he made it happen. It was Ikea with a twist. He took some cupboards that were meant to be vertical and made them horizontal.\u201d The room is anchored by a wavy-sided custom-made wooden table that calls to mind the work of George Nakashima. \u201cNot that we cook, but the kitchen is now kind of our pride and joy,\u201d Ms. Whelan said. The apartment reflects the couple\u2019s interest in nature (on display are several birds\u2019 nests from their weekend home in Hudson, N.Y.), for wood, for light (lots of candles), for the natural (sisal rugs) and for the Far East. There are a pair of miniature wooden Japanese houses on a shelf in the living room near a framed Hokusai woodblock print and a small storage chest from New York\u2019s Chinatown. \u201cEvery piece holds a memory. Every piece is meaningful to us,\u201d Ms. Whelan said enumerating flea market finds like the back-of-the-sofa table and the Barcelona day bed that often serves as a berth for overnight guests. \u201cIt\u2019s nice and broken in like a baseball glove,\u201d she said. \u201cThis was from my first trip to Tokyo with New York City Ballet,\u201d Ms. Whelan said pointing to a square of color above the kitchen shelves. \u201cI bought a kimono and cut off the bottom and had it framed. And this is from one of the dancers in the company,\u201d she said of another framed slice of fabric. \u201cShe had choreographed something and I did a little performance and she gave me a gift made from a kimono, too.\u201d No less memorable was a trip with the company to Denmark where Ms. Whelan fell hard for a copper artichoke lamp. \u201cI freaked out and said: \u2018That\u2019s the most beautiful thing I\u2019ve ever seen,\u2019 \u201d she recalled. Then she got a load of the price. \u201cI thought: \u2018That\u2019s not going to happen in my lifetime.\u2019 \u201d But wouldn\u2019t you know, a few years later, she and Mr. Michalek found almost the identical model at one of their favorite antique haunts in Hudson \u2014 at half the price. It now hangs in the apartment\u2019s entryway. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve coveted something for a long time and there it is, you can\u2019t say no,\u201d Ms. Whelan said. \u201cIt\u2019s just meant to be. It\u2019s our crowning glory.\u201d The couple\u2019s professional lives have occasionally merged, most notably when Mr. Michalek shot a series of nude photographs of City Ballet members. Several hang in the apartment. Understandably, pride of place goes to the one that features the lady of the house. \u201cIt took a lot for me to do this even for my husband,\u201d Ms. Whelan said. \u201cI was like, \u2018I don\u2019t know.\u201d And then I was like, \u2018I love this.\u2019 I\u2019m really proud of it.\u201d On the wall along the narrow isthmus between the living room and Mr. Michalek\u2019s office hangs a large square of canvas that\u2019s an abstract swirl of cerise and blue. The choreographer and visual artist Shen Wei, one of Ms. Whelan\u2019s favorites, created a dance called \u201cConnect Transfer,\u201d in which the performers, coated in body paint, color a canvas on the floor with their movements. \u201cSometimes after a show, he\u2019ll have a silent auction and sell pieces,\u201d said Ms. Whelan, who had a winning bid at one such event. \u201cI love this view,\u201d she said, gazing first at the picture, then through the open door to Mr. Michalek\u2019s work space. \u201cThe books on David\u2019s shelves are absolutely pristine. I love that the hall leads from this choreographic thing into this library.\u201d It would be nice to own an apartment, Ms. Whelan said, \u201cbecause I don\u2019t want to be throwing money out the window.\u201d But in this particular case the window \u2014 actually a whole row of windows \u2014 faces south, so \u201cif it\u2019s a sunny day, sometimes I just lie on my floor and pretend I\u2019m on the beach,\u201d she said. \u201cAs long as I can stay here, I\u2019ll gratefully stay here.\u201d A version of this article appears in print on March 2, 2014, on page RE1 of the New York edition with the headline: Choreography Meets Canvas.

        "article": "Let\u2019s establish two things: For fans of the Washington Nationals, it\u2019s not too early to talk about the playoffs. And since we\u2019re talking about the playoffs, get comfortable with the idea the key to advancing past the first round might just be one Gio Gonzalez. \u201cI\u2019ve been fortunate to pitch in a couple playoff games, and each one has been just as hard as the other,\u201d Gonzalez said this week. \u201cIt\u2019s never an easy task.\u201d To which a giant subset of Nationals fans would respond: Watching Gio Gonzalez pitch is never an easy task, either. Put aside the optics, though, and let\u2019s talk about the opportunity \u2013 and the opposition. The Nationals enter the weekend with 16 games to play and a 10-game lead over the Mets. They are going to win the National League East. They also entered Thursday night trailing the Cubs by 6-1/2 games for the NL\u2019s best record. They\u2019re not going to catch the Cubs for the top seed. Therefore, they are almost certain to face the Dodgers, who lead the NL West by five games over reeling San Francisco. [Three teams are still vying for the AL East title. Here\u2019s who to blame when your team misses out.] What does this have to do with Gonzalez? Well, Gonzalez pitches with his left hand. And the Dodgers are dreadful \u2013 and by \u201cdreadful,\u201d we mean hard-to-watch, worst-team-in-baseball awful \u2013 against men who pitch with their left hand. Told this, Gonzalez said, appropriately, \u201cI don\u2019t know, man. Look at them.\u201d The parts, of course, include dangerous left-handed hitters Corey Seager, Adrian Gonzalez and Chase Utley. Each has struggled against lefties this year. None is likely to sit in the playoffs. Look at the Dodgers as a whole, though. Pick a category against left-handers, and consider the Dodgers\u2019 position. The average major league team hits .256 against lefties. The Dodgers are hitting .213 against them. That\u2019s not just last in baseball, it\u2019s lastby 19 points. Against lefties, they own an on-base percentage of .293; that\u2019s last in baseball. Against lefties, they slug .334; that\u2019s last in baseball. (The Nats, in contrast, slug .457 against lefties.) [Who had Kyle Hendricks as a Cy Young candidate this year? Be honest.] Put another way: This year, 152 players have enough plate appearances to qualify for the batting title. Three (3) have a worse on-base-plus-slugging percentage than the Dodgers entire roster against left-handed pitching \u2014 .627, which is, say it together now, last in baseball. One more stat: As you would expect, Gonzalez is better against left-handed hitters (.212 average and .579 OPS allowed) than he is against right-handed hitters (.262 average, .751 OPS). Baseball is supposed to work that way, and Gonzalez does his part. Add it all together, and it becomes apparent why one National League executive, someone not involved in what would be a Dodgers-Nationals series, said last week, \u201cI think Gio is the most important aspect of that series.\u201d [Fancy Stats: Kyle Hendricks may lead the NL in ERA, but he\u2019s no Cy Young lock] Not Max Scherzer, who is now the favorite to win the Cy Young award. Not Tanner Roark, who has been nearly as good. Not Bryce Harper, who won the MVP award last year. Not Daniel Murphy, who is contending for it this year. Gio Gonzalez, the key to beat the Dodgers. Is he ready for it? \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s one pitcher that goes in there to a playoff game saying, \u2018Well this is a normal thing and I\u2019ve just got to go out there and do what I\u2019ve got to do,\u2019\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cThe games get a little bit longer. Hitters are a little bit more patient. Every out is extremely tough. You have to focus a little harder and just execute your pitches.\u201d This is where Nats fans would plead with Gonzalez to do exactly that: Focus a little harder and just execute your &*%#$@! pitches. But in accepting that Gonzalez is a crucial part of the nearly inevitable Dodgers-Nationals division series, Washington fans must first accept that Gonzalez is, in fact, a good pitcher. [The MLBers who have helped and hurt their free agency stock this season] Watching him live, it\u2019s impossible to put aside his penchant for responding to runs the Nationals\u2019 lineup grants him by immediately granting runs back to the opposition. Watching him live, it\u2019s impossible to ignore how he slows down when trouble arises, how he throws too many pitches (17.3 per inning, second most in the NL), how you can leave the television to get a drink and a sandwich and basically be assured to get back to the couch before the inning is over. Nats officials would prefer he pitch as he did Sunday, his most recent and best start of the year, when he worked quickly against Philadelphia and, lo and behold, tossed seven innings of one-run ball. But really, if you never watched Gonzalez pitch, you wouldn\u2019t have much of a problem with Gonzalez as a pitcher. Since joining the Nationals in 2012, Gonzalez has now thrown 893-2/3 innings. Here is the complete list of pitchers who have pitched more innings and have an ERA lower than Gonzalez\u2019s 3.54 during that time: David Price, Max Scherzer, Madison Bumgarner, Cole Hamels, Jon Lester, Clayton Kershaw, Felix Hernandez, Justin Verlander, Chris Sale, Zack Greinke, Jose Quintana, Johnny Cueto and Jordan Zimmermann. No, it\u2019s not a particularly short list. But it\u2019s certainly chock full of the best pitchers in the sport. There are indicators of recent success, too, what with Gonzalez\u2019s second-half ERA of 3.54, a number befitting a pitcher who could be handed the ball in the second or third game of a playoff series. This is not to make Gonzalez out to be one of the best pitchers in the sport. It is, though, to say in a matchup of Dodgers and Nationals, Gonzalez could swing the series. Washington went 1-5 against Los Angeles this season. The one win: July 20, when Gonzalez threw six innings of one-run ball. \u201cBaseball\u2019s a tricky sport,\u201d Gonzalez said. That it is. Tricky enough that a soon-to-be-31-year-old left-hander with a history of frustrating his own fan base could be the most important piece in the quest to play deep into October.",

        "article": "\u201cHave you been to the Battle Station?\u201d Entry to the fabled TriBeCa loft where the artist and musician Rammellzee lived and worked, all but secluding himself in a thicket of cosmic paintings, militarized plastic sculpture and Samurai-like handmade costumes, was like initiation into a secret society in which graffiti, hip-hop, linguistics and science fiction were being fused into a strange new category of art. But Rammellzee opened the doors to this world more and more rarely before he died in 2010 at 49, and even stars tended to be star-struck by an invitation. \u201cI took George Clinton and Bootsy Collins to the Battle Station for the first time, and they left feeling like they\u2019d just had a close encounter,\u201d said the bassist and music producer Bill Laswell, who met Rammellzee in the early 1980s and remained one of the few people who saw him regularly. Soon after the Sept. 11 attacks the building on Laight Street that housed the Battle Station was sold to make way for luxury apartments, and Rammellzee and his wife, Carmela Zagari, were pushed out, relocated to a conventional, smaller place in Battery Park City. Almost 20 years\u2019 worth of his obsessive artwork, enough to fill a large truck, went into a storage locker, where it remained unseen for years, in danger of being forgotten for good. But pieces of it are now starting to re-emerge, in a way that Rammellzee most likely would have approved of: in fighter formation. A bunkerlike, black-lighted re-creation of the Battle Station was one of the most talked-about pieces in \u201cArt in the Streets,\u201d a sprawling graffiti survey last year at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, organized by the museum\u2019s director, Jeffrey Deitch, who as a New York dealer had courted Rammellzee for years. On March 8 the Suzanne Geiss Company, a new gallery in SoHo, will open its inaugural show by suspending, as if in flight, two complete sets of works that Rammellzee called \u201cletter racers,\u201d spacecraftlike sculptures representing the letters A to Z, built bricolage style from scraps of cast-off consumer goods like flip-flops, sunglasses, toy cars, cheap umbrellas, Bic pens and air-freshener tops. The only other complete set of the racers, made from gold-painted wood and surrealistically situated pieces of Kewpie dolls and plastic dinosaurs, is now installed high along a series of second-floor gallery walls at the Museum of Modern Art in \u201cPrintin,\u2019 \u201d an eclectic exhibition of print-influenced work that opened Feb. 15. The emergence of the sculptures from deep storage, engineered by Ms. Zagari with the help of Ms. Geiss, who represents Rammellzee\u2019s estate, has already begun to reshape the reputation of an artist regarded by the established art world during most of his life with more bemused curiosity and confusion than serious interest. Was he a hip-hop artist with visual-art leanings? (He was a renowned 1980s M.C., and his 1983 collaboration with K-Rob, the 12-inch-single \u201cBeatbop,\u201d became a hip-hop landmark, its cover designed by the painter Jean-Michel Basquiat, Rammellzee\u2019s friend and rival.) Was he most important as a muse and scene maker? (He is depicted in several Basquiat paintings, most memorably in customized, gogglelike sunglasses in \u201cHollywood Africans,\u201d in the Whitney Museum of American Art\u2019s collection. And he had a scene-stealing cameo in the 1984 Jim Jarmusch movie \u201cStranger Than Paradise.\u201d) Or was he mainly a painter and sculptor whose frenetic genre-bending and wildly eccentric visual style obscured his seriousness? (His early paintings and resin works sold briskly for several years to European collectors, including major ones like Heiner Friedrich, co-founder of the Dia Art Foundation. But by the time the Battle Station was disassembled, his works could make their way ignominiously down the streets of Manhattan in the back of a truck, as Ms. Zagari remembered, with \u201ckids watching, saying, \u2018Mama, look, they\u2019re throwing out all those toys.\u2019 \u201d) Rammellzee never made it easy to answer any of these questions. His pharaonic name \u2014 which he formulated as a teenager, after leaving home in the projects in Far Rockaway, Queens, and later legally adopted \u2014 was not a name at all, he insisted, but a mathematical equation. His artwork, though he did show it in galleries, at least in the early years, was artwork only secondarily, he said. Its real purpose was to illustrate a deconstructionist-type dual philosophy, called Gothic Futurism and Ikonoklast Panzerism, that imagined a world in which Roman letters would arm and liberate themselves, at his command, from the power structures of European language. He believed he had inherited his role as a kind of lexical commander in chief from medieval monks, whose literacy in a mostly illiterate world demonstrated the extraordinary power of words to shape reality. \u201cHe felt that even now if you control the language, you control the discourse, you control the power,\u201d said Henry Chalfant, a filmmaker and graffiti scholar who first met Rammellzee at a 1980 exhibition of graffiti work by Lee Quinones and Fred Brathwaite (better known as Fab 5 Freddy) at White Columns gallery in SoHo. \u201cThe letter racers were in his conception totally functional, like models to demonstrate how the letters would work if they were ever to be mechanized and able to fly into battle,\u201d Mr. Chalfant said.",

        "article": "By Fabiana Santana The Daily Meal If you love beer, you have an appreciation for how it's made. According to the Brewers Association, an average of 1.5 new breweries opens every day in the U.S. alone, and 2013 saw a 15-percent increase in regional craft breweries. The microbrewery market, meanwhile, rose over 22 percent from 2012 to 2013. In 2014, 13 states reached the 100-brewery milestone. In November, the United States brewery count returned to historic levels. The number of opened breweries passed 3,200 mark and the number of brewery licenses reached the highest ever, topping 4,500 in the first sixth months of the year. The boom in beer production marks the return of localized beer production specifically. The American Enterprise Institute calls this the \"Golden Age of Beer,\" and with this big boom comes big competition. For cities like Boston, where major brands like Samuel Adams are based, opening a brewery is serious business since all eyes will be on you. Trillium Brewing Company took the leap and set up shop against the big boys and highlighted local artisans, farmers, and growers as partners in their beer. In fact, when the company had to shut down for a short time between Thanksgiving and Christmas, fans worried they hadn\u2019t been able to take the heat. Competition in Ashville, N.C., dubbed \"Beer City, USA,\" is reaching new heights, too. A new crop of breweries seems to open daily. \"'Dramatic' doesn\u2019t even begin to explain what\u2019s happened [in the world of beer] in 20 years,\u201d said Leah Wong Ashburn, vice president at Highland Brewing, Asheville\u2019s first \"legal\" brewery. So, whose brews are the best? We ranked the best new breweries in the U.S. based on innovation, quality, brew master background and beer availability. Anyone with taste buds and a hardy liver is obsessed with Asheville, N.C. these days. The city has been dubbed the craft beer capital of the America and breweries like Hi-Wire are the reason why. RateBeer named Hi-Wire the best in the city and owners Chris Frosaker and Adam Charnack won the most medals at the 2014 NC Brewer\u2019s Cup. A fan favorite is the Hi-Wire LAGER, which takes eight weeks to produce, and is made with 100-percent Pilsen malt. Tennessee Brew Works is the first to utilize the Meura Micro Mash Filter with a U.S.-made Aegir Brewing System to prepare their entire menu in-house. This means greater energy and raw material conservation and a seasonally changing beer menu that highlights flavors like sweet potato (which is actually mashed into the grains) and basil. Down some during their live music events from Thursday through Sunday. Brewmaster Tim Sciascia focuses on small batch production, one beer at a time, at Cellarmaker. The limited output and disregard for a set production schedule means that he can focus more time on experimenting with different barrels, yeast, and hops. Hops are a fan favorite, so there will always be a version of hop-driven beer on hand and, if you\u2019re lucky, will get a taste of creative crafts like Coffee and Cigarettes smoked stout. Eventually they will hand-bottle barrel-aged beers. But for now, it\u2019s all about the taproom. Aptly named Side Project Brewing is actually Perennial Brewing Company head brewer Cory King\u2019s side project. Here, he specializes in unique, small-batch brews that are completely barrel-aged. Their Abricot du Fermier was aged in oak with apricots and their Blanc de Blancs is a beer that wine lovers will scratch their heads over (fermented in chardonnay barrels with Missouri-grown chardonnel grapes \u2014 a hybrid of chardonnay and the French-American hybrid seyval). Their first year out of the gate, Creature Comforts Brewing Co. won a bronze at the 2014 Great American Beer Festival for their American Brett Beer, Curiosity No. 2. The limited release ale featured kiwi and pineapple juice and solidified this new venture by David Stein (Twain's Billiards & Tap\u2019s former head brewer), Adam Beauchamp (formerly of Sweetwater Brewing Co. and an almost Ph.D. in Genetics) and Derek Imes as one to be reckoned with. Greg Engert is the only beer pro named Sommelier of the Year by Food and Wine. His Blue Jacket brewery is one \u201cwithout borders.\u201d So, expect constant experimentation and innovation, with nods to tradition and technique, from the rotating selection of beers, cask ales and more on offer at their home restaurant and bar, The Arsenal. If you\u2019re lucky enough to snag a spot for a brewery tour, take it, because they are a hot ticket. Spencer Trappist Ale is the first and only certified Trappist brewery in the United States. Run by monks, the place only makes one beer (because that\u2019s the way the old-school Belgium monks did it back in the day). Their ale is unfiltered and unpasteurized, and made with only four ingredients: well-protected glacial waters, Washington state hops, a proprietary blend of barley, and a family yeast.

        "article": "WASHINGTON\u2014House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who led Democrats to a huge defeat at the polls this week, stunned many in her party Friday by announcing she will seek to remain their leader in the new Republican-led Congress. Ms. Pelosi's announcement came as a surprise after an election that saw her party lose 60 House seats, with a handful of races still too close to call. Past House speakers have left Congress entirely after similar drubbings, and some Democratic critics had called on Ms. Pelosi to step aside. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says she will run for the post of minority leader in the new Congress, rather than bow to Democratic critics who want her to step down. Janet Hook has details. Plus, economist Nouriel Roubini and WSJ's economics editor David Wessel look at the Fed's latest effort at monetary stimulus. But Ms. Pelosi is all but certain to win the minority leader's post. In defeat, her caucus is more liberal and in tune with her own views. At least 22 of the 55 conservative House Democrats, known collectively as the Blue Dog Coalition, were defeated in the midterm elections, and six others retired. So far, no other candidate for Democratic leader has surfaced. Ms. Pelosi's decision, like the post-election message coming from President Barack Obama, sent a signal that Democrats don't see their election defeat as a repudiation of their agenda and their leadership. In a letter to colleagues announcing her plans, Ms. Pelosi said that she had \"no intention of allowing our great achievements to be rolled back.'' She added that, \"driven by the urgency of protecting health care reform, Wall Street reform, and Social Security and Medicare, I have decided to run.\" Her decision to remain in the leadership stunned conservative and centrist Democrats, who thought the public face of the party in the House should be someone more sympathetic to the views of conservative Democrats, the business community and deficit hawks. Senate, House, governors' and other races at the state, district and county level See how race, gender, age, income, key issues and other factors affected voters' choices in the House. Compare control of the House in 2010 to 2008 elections, plus see how economics and the health-care vote may have affected some races. \"This was an earthquake of an election,\" said Rep. Jim Matheson (D., Utah), chairman of the Blue Dog Coalition. \"When you suffer this kind of loss, you've got to shake up your leadership.\" Some Democrats said they worried that Ms. Pelosi's presence in the party leadership would hurt candidates\u2014not just for Congress but also for state and local offices. Ms. Pelosi's image was used by Republicans across the country in ads against Democrats for state legislative races. \"I can't speak to what it means in Washington, but [Ms. Pelosi's presence] makes it tougher for us in the outlying states,\" said Scott Maddox, a former state party chairman in Florida, who lost a bid Tuesday for state agriculture commissioner after facing TV ads linking him to the speaker. \"They have demonized her.\" Some centrist Democrats had hoped Ms. Pelosi would step aside for the current No. 2 House leader, Rep. Steny Hoyer (D., Md.), who is seen as more in tune with their outlook and better equipped to rebuild the party. An aide to Ms. Pelosi said the White House didn't weigh in on her decision. One senior White House official welcomed it, saying she was a loyal ally for the president. Republicans could scarcely suppress their glee that Ms. Pelosi would remain on the scene. They believe that an aversion to the House speaker helped Republicans energize their own base and win independent voters, 55% of whom backed the GOP this year, a swing of 16 percentage points from the last midterm election. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi stunned many in her party on Friday. \"The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, and expecting a different result,'' said Ken Spain, spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee. \"Of course, if House Democrats are willing to sacrifice more of their members in 2012 for the glory of Nancy Pelosi, we are happy to oblige them.\" Liberal Democrats praised Ms. Pelosi's decision and denounced those who would make her a scapegoat. \"Speaker Nancy Pelosi is one of the strongest, most progressive leaders in Washington,'' leaders of the liberal Moveon.org said in an email to members. \"But after Tuesday's elections, some corporate Democrats are taking the wrong lesson\u2014saying that Democrats should be less progressive and more like the Republicans.'' Ms. Pelosi's decision to seek another term as the top House Democrat has the potential to squeeze Mr. Hoyer out of the leadership. The two had been rivals for the speaker's job but forged a working relationship during the past four years. Within minutes of Ms. Pelosi's announcement, party whip James Clyburn of South Carolina and Caucus Chairman John Larson of Connecticut announced their intention to retain their jobs, which would be the No. 2 and No. 3 slots in the minority caucus. Those announcements leave Mr. Hoyer with a decision to make. He can run against Mr. Clyburn, an African-American who rose to prominence during the Civil Rights movement; seek a lesser post; or step aside altogether. His political base inside the caucus was decimated on election night with the defeat of the Blue Dogs. During an interview with Diane Sawyer, Nancy Pelosi talks about her successes, being a woman in politics and hitting the marble ceiling. Video courtesy of ABC World News. In the days after the election, Ms. Pelosi hunkered down in the Capitol and called fellow Democrats to sound them out about her future. She is her party's leading fund-raiser after President Obama, and has navigated major legislation through the House. But even some admirers say her liberal profile, tarnished by the 2010 campaign, make her a mismatch for the challenge facing the party. \"This is a party that has to restore its standing with the center,'' said Will Marshall, president of the Progressive Policy Institute, a centrist think tank. \"This is a time for Democrats to consider fresh leadership.'' House Democrats will meet in a closed-party caucus to chose their new leadership lineup later this month\u2013probably when Congress returns for a lame-duck session Nov. 15. Ms. Pelosi is expected to win the secret-ballot election, even if she draws a challenger. Rep. Heath Shuler, a conservative Democrat from North Carolina, has threatened to run against her but didn't declare his intentions on Friday.",

        "article": "The letter, claiming to be from a worker in a labor camp in China, was neatly written and inside the sealed box. An Oregon woman is hoping to raise awareness about labor camps in China after she received a letter sealed in a toy box purportedly from a worker \u201cunder persecution.\u201d Julie Keith, 42, told the Oregonian she thinks the letter she found in a Halloween graveyard kit from Kmart is authentic. In the letter, the author pleads with the outside world to try to put an end to inhumane work environments and labor camps in China. \u201cIf you occasionally buy this product, please kindly resend this letter to the World Human Right Organization,\u201d the letter reads. \u201cThousands people here who are under the persecution of the Chinese Communist Party Government will thank and remember you forever.\" The letter is written in English but unsigned. Chinese characters are intermixed with the neatly and cleanly written English script. Keith says she found the letter sealed inside the graveyard kit\u2019s cellophane interior. It was folded into eighths and stuck in the Styrofoam. \u201cI fully believe it is real,\u201d she told Fox News.com \u201cIt had to have come from where they said.\u201d The author of the letter explains the Halloween toy was made in unit 8, department 2 of the Masanjia Labor Camp in Shenyang, China. \u201cPeople who work here have to work 15 hours a day without Saturday, Sunday break and any holidays. Otherwise, they will suffer (punishment), beat and rude remark. Nearly no payment (10 yuan/1 month).\" Ten yuan is about $1.60. Jarred by the letter, Keith posted a photo of it on Facebook and asked for feedback. Human Rights Watch also took a look at the note. \"We're in no position to confirm the veracity or origin of this,\" Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch, told the Oregonian. \"I think it is fair to say the conditions described in the letter certainly conform to what we know about conditions in re-education through labor camps.\" For decades, China has run labor camps for alleged troublemakers. Laborers are sentenced to years of work without formal arrest or trial. Masanjia labor camp is located in Liaoning Province in northeast China. \"If this thing is the real deal, that's somebody saying please help me, please know about me, please react,\" Richardson said. \"That's our job.\" Meanwhile, the Oregonian has also informed the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) about the letter and an investigation was launched. It unclear how long such a probe might take, but the Oregonian points out that goods made in a foreign country and imported to the United States cannot, by law, be produced in labor camps or prisons. \u201cAll goods, wares, articles, and merchandise mined, produced, or manufactured wholly or in part in any foreign country by convict labor or/and forced labor or/and indentured labor under penal sanctions shall not be entitled to entry at any of the ports of the United States,\u201d reads Title 19, section 1307 of U.S. Code. Sears Holdings Corporation, which operates Kmart, said in a statement it works \u201cto ensure that vendors and factories producing merchandise for our company adhere to specific Program Requirements, and all local laws pertaining to employment standards and workplace practices.\u201d \u201cWe understand the seriousness of this allegation, and will continue to investigate,\u201d the statement said. For her part, Keith said she wants to remind people to pay attention to where -- and potentially how -- goods end up on the shelves. \u201cIf I really don't need it, I won't buy it if it's made in China,\" she said. \"This has really made me more aware. I hope it would make a difference.\"",

        "article": "Can Terry Gilliam do opera? (Photo: AP) It\u2019s no bad thing to be an amateur: we all have things we like to do, however badly. But there comes a point when amateurs delight their audience too much. And there are areas of life that they\u2019re better off avoiding in the first place. If I go to hospital, I\u2019d rather have my bypass done by a professional than by a keen enthusiast who\u2019s handy with a knife. And if I go to the opera, I\u2019d rather see a show directed by someone who knows what he\u2019s doing, than by someone who likes Puccini and thought he\u2019d give it a shot. Which has been the case at English National Opera in recent months. The chief qualification for directing opera there at the moment seems to be that of never having done it before. It\u2019s called innocence. According to ENO\u2019s management, it brings a fresh perspective to familiar pieces, which may be true. But it\u2019s also a high-risk policy that hasn\u2019t worked out well so far. These innocent directors come with past successes in the West End or in film and television, and assume their skills are easily transferred. But opera has its own rules \u2013 about story-telling, characterisation, movement, pace \u2013 all governed by the music. It\u2019s a self-contained, self-referencing culture that you learn by paying your dues \u2013 ideally, as the Germans do in their strictly hierarchical system, starting with small things for small companies and working your way up to big things for big ones. Marching straight on to a major stage with no inside experience of lyric theatre is a march to the scaffold. And audiences at the Coliseum have observed this happening time and again. Last autumn, a new production of Don Giovanni was handed to Rufus Norris, an award-winning Broadway and West End director but with no experience of opera beyond self-declared love (every amateur\u2019s excuse). And what was the result? Disaster. Then came Lucrezia Borgia, a problem piece by Donizetti that required strong directorial solutions, but in the hands of Mike Figgis \u2013 well-established film director, new to opera \u2013 got only distractions: sumptuous cinematic interludes that had nothing to do with what was happening (or more worryingly, not happening) on stage and felt like an admission of defeat. A message to the audience saying: sorry, I do film, I don\u2019t do singing. Passing over the damp squib of Gounod\u2019s Faust, staged by Des McAnuff \u2013 experienced in musicals, feeling his way feebly into opera \u2013 we\u2019re now about to get Berlioz\u2019s The Damnation of Faust from Terry Gilliam, the man who put the crushing foot into the Monty Python graphics, and yet another operatic first-timer. And though it would be wrong to damn him with prejudgment, nothing he\u2019s said to date about his approach to this new world inspires confidence. Like all the others, he loves opera. He identifies with its emotional excesses and irrationality. But can he deal with a chorus: the strange phenomenon of 40-odd people giving voice to the same thought in the same words at the same time? Can he make theatre out of song \u2013 which, without considerable help, is essentially a stand-and-deliver medium? And above all, can he cope with the fact that, in opera, the director has no control over pace (which is fixed by the score, via the conductor)? John Gielgud, who dabbled in opera direction, never could. There\u2019s a famous story of him in a Covent Garden rehearsal where he wanted to change something, but the score rolled on like an express train, and he ran to the conductor wailing \u201cDo, do, DO stop that TERRIBLE music\u201d. Which, of course, is the one thing you can\u2019t do in opera. It\u2019s a medium where the music always wins, and takes no prisoners. That they like Puccini doesn\u2019t spare them if they don\u2019t know how it works.",

        "article": "Rockwell Automation's demand problems should be taken as a warning to others. On Wednesday Rockwell Automation (nyse: ROK - news - people ) sunk 13.8%, or $7.22, to $44.93, in late-afternoon trading after it lowered its third quarter earnings guidance range to between 93 cents and $1.00. The number hurts. Wall Street expected $1.13 per share, and on top of that, Rockwell doesn't think it'll hit its full year outlook range of $4.25 to $4.45. Wall Street had expected $4.29. Based in Milwaukee, the company makes factory automation systems. Richard Eastman, an analyst at Robert W. Baird, said Rockwell's announcement could mean a slowdown across the business is nigh. \"The architecture and software business is probably the more leading indicator within their business because it is a shorter-turns business,\" Eastman said. Rockwell pointed the finger at U.S. and Europe, stressing that it was the \"less favorable market conditions\" in those regions that led to the revision. Rockwell added that sales in April were inline with its original expectations, but over the past several weeks things began to sag in the U.S. and Europe, primarily in its product business, which is more dependent on long-term contracts. Rockwell also hasn't seen the expected sales growth in its higher-margin architecture and software segment. \"It appears that market growth is slowing in two key regions,\" said Rockwell Chief Executive Keith Nosbusch, \"and we will deal with that reality.\" It is an especially hard reality for Rockwell. In its second quarter, which was reported in April, the company posted sales of $717.0 million from the U.S. and $337.7 million from Europe, Middle East, Africa region, constituting 75.0% of its total business. In a small note of consolation, Rockwell noted that--inline with its expectations--it's still riding strong growth in the Asia Pacific and Latin American regions. Citigroup analyst Jeffrey T. Sprague said he was still optimistic on Rockwell's long-term prospects and said its markets--including mining, food, oil and gas--are solid. \"Rockwell's solid long-term outlook is focused on bringing its expertise abroad,\" he said, according to the Associated Press. \"Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America are all wide open playing fields.\" In any event, Rockwell is the most recent business to cut its outlook because of flagging economic activity in the U.S. and Europe. On Monday the United Parcel Service (nyse: UPS - news - people ) cut its outlook range to 83 cents to 88 cents from 97 cents to $1.04 thanks to a weak U.S. economy and high energy prices. (See \"UPS Unwrapped By Fuel\") That announcement came in the wake of FedEx (nyse: FDX - news - people )'s own disappointing earnings results and outlook. (See \"FedEx Doesn't Deliver\") If Rockwell's problems are related, it would indicate that high energy prices are bleeding into businesses not as intimately connected with oil and transportation.

        "article": "After prosecutors depicted Anna Nicole Smith as a victim of her friends, defense lawyers will their chance Wednesday to tell jurors that the former Playboy model was actually being rescued from constant pain by those who gave her prescription drugs. Attorney Brad Brunon, who began his summation Tuesday with a defense of Dr. Khristine Eroshevich, will be followed by lawyers for Dr. Sandeep Kapoor and Howard K. Stern. The two physicians and the late model's lawyer-boyfriend have pleaded not guilty to conspiring to provide excessive prescription drugs to an addict and other charges. They are not charged in Smith's 2007 accidental overdose death. The drug conspiracy case, now in its ninth week, is expected to go to the jury by week's end after a rebuttal by prosecutors. Deputy District Attorney Renee Rose concluded some eight hours of prosecution arguments presented over two days. She accused the defendants of feeding Smith's addiction to prescription drugs for their own self interest. She said they tried to use the drugs to enhance their friendship with Smith and her world of celebrity. Brunon countered that it was not a crime to prescribe medication for a friend in pain. He ridiculed a prosecution argument that accused his client of giving Smith drugs to make her feel good. \"Isn't that what a doctor is supposed to do?\" Brunon asked in his closing argument. \"Is there a charge that Dr. Eroshevich committed a crime because she prescribed to a friend? No. It's not a crime.\" Rose showed jurors pictures they had already seen of Smith and Eroshevich naked in a bathtub, and said it proved the doctor had lost her objectivity in prescribing for Smith, who was her neighbor and friend. The photos were part of an elaborate prosecution digital slideshow that the defense called the best money can buy. Brunon said no defendant could match the resources of the Los Angeles District Attorney's office and reminded jurors of the vast costs of the case, with $100,000 paid to experts and $40,000 spent to bring two witnesses from the Bahamas. He also said prosecutors misled jurors by showing photos of items such as a burnt spoon and lighter allegedly used to melt down medication, stressing that the items were never found and were not in evidence. \"Don't be mesmerized by the pretty colored pictures,\" he advised jurors. Brunon spoke with few visual aids. Rose asked the jury to convict the defendants of providing excessive drugs to an addict. The judge reminded them that a person who seeks medication primarily for pain relief is not an addict.",

        "article": "Nov. 23, 2013: President Barack Obama speaks in the State Dining Room at the White HouseAP President Barack Obama's statement Saturday night on the interim nuclear deal reached with Iran, as provided by the White House: \"Good evening. Today, the United States -- together with our close allies and partners -- took an important first step toward a comprehensive solution that addresses our concerns with the Islamic Republic of Iran's nuclear program. \"Since I took office, I've made clear my determination to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. As I've said many times, my strong preference is to resolve this issue peacefully, and we've extended the hand of diplomacy. Yet for many years, Iran has been unwilling to meet its obligations to the international community. So my administration worked with Congress, the United Nations Security Council and countries around the world to impose unprecedented sanctions on the Iranian government. \"These sanctions have had a substantial impact on the Iranian economy, and with the election of a new Iranian president earlier this year, an opening for diplomacy emerged. I spoke personally with President Rouhani of Iran earlier this fall. Secretary Kerry has met multiple times with Iran's foreign minister. And we have pursued intensive diplomacy -- bilaterally with the Iranians, and together with our P5-plus-1 partners -- the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia and China, as well as the European Union. \"Today, that diplomacy opened up a new path toward a world that is more secure -- a future in which we can verify that Iran's nuclear program is peaceful and that it cannot build a nuclear weapon. \"While today's announcement is just a first step, it achieves a great deal. For the first time in nearly a decade, we have halted the progress of the Iranian nuclear program, and key parts of the program will be rolled back. Iran has committed to halting certain levels of enrichment and neutralizing part of its stockpiles. Iran cannot use its next-generation centrifuges, which are used for enriching uranium. Iran cannot install or start up new centrifuges, and its production of centrifuges will be limited. Iran will halt work at its plutonium reactor. And new inspections will provide extensive access to Iran's nuclear facilities and allow the international community to verify whether Iran is keeping its commitments. \"These are substantial limitations which will help prevent Iran from building a nuclear weapon. Simply put, they cut off Iran's most likely paths to a bomb. Meanwhile, this first step will create time and space over the next six months for more negotiations to fully address our comprehensive concerns about the Iranian program. And because of this agreement, Iran cannot use negotiations as cover to advance its program. \"On our side, the United States and our friends and allies have agreed to provide Iran with modest relief, while continuing to apply our toughest sanctions. We will refrain from imposing new sanctions, and we will allow the Iranian government access to a portion of the revenue that they have been denied through sanctions. But the broader architecture of sanctions will remain in place and we will continue to enforce them vigorously. And if Iran does not fully meet its commitments during this six-month phase, we will turn off the relief and ratchet up the pressure. \"Over the next six months, we will work to negotiate a comprehensive solution. We approach these negotiations with a basic understanding: Iran, like any nation, should be able to access peaceful nuclear energy. But because of its record of violating its obligations, Iran must accept strict limitations on its nuclear program that make it impossible to develop a nuclear weapon. \"In these negotiations, nothing will be agreed to unless everything is agreed to. The burden is on Iran to prove to the world that its nuclear program will be exclusively for peaceful purposes. \"If Iran seizes this opportunity, the Iranian people will benefit from rejoining the international community, and we can begin to chip away at the mistrust between our two nations. This would provide Iran with a dignified path to forge a new beginning with the wider world based on mutual respect. If, on the other hand, Iran refuses, it will face growing pressure and isolation. \"Over the last few years, Congress has been a key partner in imposing sanctions on the Iranian government, and that bipartisan effort made possible the progress that was achieved today. Going forward, we will continue to work closely with Congress. However, now is not the time to move forward on new sanctions -- because doing so would derail this promising first step, alienate us from our allies and risk unraveling the coalition that enabled our sanctions to be enforced in the first place. \"That international unity is on display today. The world is united in support of our determination to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. Iran must know that security and prosperity will never come through the pursuit of nuclear weapons -- it must be reached through fully verifiable agreements that make Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons impossible. \"As we go forward, the resolve of the United States will remain firm, as will our commitments to our friends and allies - particularly Israel and our Gulf partners, who have good reason to be skeptical about Iran's intentions. \"Ultimately, only diplomacy can bring about a durable solution to the challenge posed by Iran's nuclear program. As president and commander-in-chief, I will do what is necessary to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. But I have a profound responsibility to try to resolve our differences peacefully, rather than rush towards conflict. Today, we have a real opportunity to achieve a comprehensive, peaceful settlement, and I believe we must test it. \"The first step that we've taken today marks the most significant and tangible progress that we've made with Iran since I took office. And now we must use the months ahead to pursue a lasting and comprehensive settlement that would resolve an issue that has threatened our security -- and the security of our allies -- for decades. It won't be easy, and huge challenges remain ahead. But through strong and principled diplomacy, the United States of America will do our part on behalf of a world of greater peace, security, and cooperation among nations.",

        "article": "Luke Sharrett for The New York Times Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Mayor Michael Nutter of Philadelphia on Thursday. WASHINGTON \u2014 Some mayors spoke about the bad feeling they got with each call that there had been another shooting in their city. Others described the pain of burying police officers who had worked for them. Many recalled their attempts to console grieving families. So as mayors from around the nation gathered here on Thursday for the 81st winter meeting of the United States Conference of Mayors, many said they were heartened by President Obama\u2019s call for new laws to curb gun violence, which included several measures that the conference had sought for decades. Many said they planned to urge Congress to enact them. \u201cFar too often it is the mayor who gets the call about a tragic crime committed with an illegal gun that\u2019s resulted in a loss of life,\u201d Mayor Michael Nutter of Philadelphia, the president of the conference, said in a speech. \u201cIt may be the life of a child. A police officer. A young black man. A young woman. It could be anyone in our cities. But it\u2019s the mayor who visits the family members who have had their hearts torn out, and the mayor who attends funeral after funeral after funeral.\u201d Mayor Ron Littlefield of Chattanooga, Tenn., recalled a police officer who was shot to death while responding to a robbery at a pawnshop. Mayor Sly James of Kansas City, Mo., lamented what he called the \u201cslow-motion mass murder\u201d that claims the lives of more than 100 young people in his city each year. And Mayor R. T. Rybak of Minneapolis said he had \u201cheard too many eulogies for amazing people whom I will never know.\u201d The mayors gave a standing ovation to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who praised the work they had done over the years on gun issues and urged them to push for the passage of the president\u2019s proposals. \u201cThere are some who say the most powerful voice in this debate belongs to the gun lobby and those who demand a stop to these common-sense approaches to save lives,\u201d Mr. Biden told the Conference of Mayors. \u201cI think they\u2019re wrong.\u201d \u201cNewtown has shocked the nation,\u201d the vice president said. \u201cThe carnage on our streets is no longer able to be ignored. We\u2019re going to take this fight to the halls of Congress. We\u2019re going to take it beyond that. We\u2019re going to take it to the American people.\u201d Many mayors said they were eager at the prospect that new gun laws might pass. Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. of Charleston, S.C., who has been in office for more than three decades, said he hoped that the country would \u201cseize this moment.\u201d \u201cI know that no police officer wants to be confronted with an assault weapon,\u201d he said. \u201cThey would be out-ammoed. And I think that it\u2019s time for our country to deal with this, it\u2019s time for Congress to deal with this.\u201d But even here, at a meeting of a group that has advocated stricter gun laws for decades, there was not unanimity. Mayor Mick Cornett of Oklahoma City, a Republican, said he did not believe that the gun control proposals being discussed would \u201cresolve the problem they\u2019re trying to resolve.\u201d \u201cThere are larger issues out there, and more specific issues, and I really would like to see us get a better handle on mental health,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the way that has trended in the last 10 years, the way that filters out into our jails and types of violence like this needs to be addressed. I wish they\u2019d concentrate on that.\u201d One thing the mayors who are seeking new gun laws seem to lack is a high-profile sitting Republican mayor who agrees with them \u2014 the way, say, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani became an influential voice in the debate in the early 1990s when he expressed his support for an assault weapons ban. (Mr. Giuliani reiterated his support for such a ban in an interview this month on NY1, the New York cable news channel.) But some Republican mayors from smaller cities support tighter gun laws. Mayor Richard Ward of Hurst, Tex., a Republican, came here to lobby Congress with Mayors Against Illegal Guns, an advocacy group led by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York and Mayor Thomas M. Menino of Boston. Mr. Ward, a gun owner who said he enjoyed \u201cblasting away\u201d at targets, said that after he joined the group, he got more than 100 letters from constituents who belonged to the National Rifle Association urging him to leave it. \u201cThe next election I got 90 percent of the vote,\u201d he said, chuckling. \u201cAfter that I got 86 percent \u2014 they\u2019re gaining on me!\u201d Mr. Rybak, the Minneapolis mayor, suggested that his counterparts, who buy thousands of guns to arm their police departments, should use their clout with the gun industry. \u201cWe buy a boatload of guns in this country,\u201d he said Wednesday at a news conference called by Mayors Against Illegal Guns. \u201cIf the gun lobby comes here to Congress and starts throwing their weight around about what\u2019s going to happen with guns, well, the mayors of America are going to stand up: we buy a lot more guns than almost anybody in this country.\u201d",

        "article": "Agathe Snow's name has been synonymous with New York's Lower East Side underground art scene for several years, but it's only recently that she has begun calling herself an artist. The Corsica-born 33-year-old was the rogue female in a group of artists famed as much for their wild antics as for their art. Dan Colen, Dash Snow (to whom she was married for nine years) and photographer Ryan McGinley became notorious for producing work that was provocative and obscene. Colen and Dash Snow's drug-fuelled installations consisted of trashing gallery spaces and hotel rooms until they resembled litter-filled \"hamster nests\". Colen also did a nice range in dribbly abstracts designed to look like bird droppings. The group's antics were photographed by McGinley, who became their unofficial biographer, revealing their hedonism to be a part and product of their art. But perhaps it was the egocentricity of her male counterparts that led Agathe Snow to keep a semi-detached distance from the collective. Instead, she pursued her own offbeat performances that involved cooking for hundreds of people, or marathon dance contests where she invited participants to keep going as long as their bodies could hold out. She never thought of these happenings as artworks; her drive was her immediate community, and celebrating the spirit of the Lower East Side. Then, in 2007, art dealer James Fuentes invited Snow to convert his new gallery space in New York's Chinatown. In response, Snow imagined a waterlogged Manhattan, in which survivors built a home for themselves in the belly of a whale. The sculpture evolved over the duration of the exhibition as Snow incorporated objects brought in by visitors. The results were critically praised and led to an invitation to show at Peres Projects in Berlin. The show I Don't Know but I've Been Told Eskimo Pussy is Mighty Cold was another apocalyptic sculptural installation featuring crucified animals made from neon signs, finds from flea markets and assorted junk. She later showed at Peres Projects in Los Angeles, driving a truck from Chinatown in New York to Chinatown in LA, stopping only to eat Chinese food on the way. The sculptures made on the journey were exhibited at the gallery on her arrival. Why we like her? For Total Attitude Work Out Video, 2008, a film featuring a troupe of models dressed in Jane Fonda-style leotards, acting out their five-point plans for surviving awkward situations. They range from How to Get Off Easy when Pulled Over by the Cops, to How to Behave when Meeting Jesus. Community art: Snow's love of group performances came from her early childhood experiences of downtown New York, where her mother ran a not-very-profitable restaurant called La Po\u00e8me. Her mother semi-adopted the neighbourhood's graffiti kids and the restaurant became a place to hang out; it was there that Snow first met Colen and McGinley. \u2022 Agathe Snow's sculptures can be seen at the Saatchi gallery as part of Abstract America: New Painting and Sculpture, which runs from 29 May to 13 September.",

        "article": "San Francisco 49ers head coach Jim Harbaugh reacts during the first half of the NFL Super Bowl XLVII football game against the Baltimore Ravens on Feb. 3, 2013, in New Orleans. Super Bowl XLVII is behind us, but Baltimore\u2019s 34-31 win over San Francisco is the kind of game people will keep talking about all off-season \u2013 and beyond. (And not just because of these awful commercials) Here are five questions the sports world be debating all summer: 1. Why exactly was there a power outage? It was an odd Super Bowl (I\u2019ve already written about the wonderful weirdness that was Sunday night). But things turned downright surreal in the Superdome when the lights went out early in the third quarter, causing a 34 minute delay. So what happened? According to the AP: A joint statement from Entergy New Orleans, which provides power to the stadium, and Superdome operator SMG shed some light on the chain of events, which apparently started at the spot where Entergy feeds power into the stadium\u2019s lines. The problem occurred shortly after Beyonc\u00e9 put on a halftime show that featured extravagant lighting and video effects. \u201cA piece of equipment that is designed to monitor electrical load sensed an abnormality in the system,\u201d the statement said. \u201cOnce the issue was detected, the sensing equipment operated as designed and opened a breaker, causing power to be partially cut to the Superdome in order to isolate the issue. \u2026 Entergy and SMG will continue to investigate the root cause of the abnormality.\u201d (Read the full report) New Orleans mayor Mitch Landrieu said \u201cin the coming days, I expect a full after-action report from all parties involved.\u201d Hopefully, such a report will solve a crucial riddle: Is Beyonc\u00e9 at all to blame? 2. In the game\u2019s deciding moments, why did San Francisco ditch the Pistol? San Francisco trailed 34-29 in the game\u2019s waning moments, and had the ball on Baltimore\u2019s seven-yard-line. First down. \u201cI was sitting there thinking there\u2019s no way,\u201d says Baltimore Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco. \u201cThere\u2019s no way we stop them here.\u201d The Ravens did, thanks in part to San Francisco\u2019s oddball play-calling. San Francisco running back Frank Gore had 110-yards rushing in the Super Bowl, and averaged a robust 5.8 yards per carry. Quarterback Colin Kaepernick had run for 62 yards in the game, on 8.9 yards per carry. And yet, with the championship on the line, neither player used their legs on those final four plays. The \u201cPistol\u201d offense, with Kaepernick reading \u2014 and fooling \u2014 the defense, and deciding to hand it to Gore or run it himself, fell silent. A handoff to LaMichael James produced a two-yard gain. Then, Kaepernick tried three straight passes to wide receiver Michael Crabtree, and each missed. The final one, on fourth down, was especially questionable: Kaepernick chucked it to the side of the end zone on a fade pattern, where Crabtree had little room to maneuver. The Niners hinged their Super Bowl hopes on a jump ball, but Kaepernick overthrew it. The play never had a chance. 3. But wasn\u2019t there holding on that final play? San Francisco fans have a legitimate beef: although that final play from scrimmage was badly designed, Baltimore\u2019s Jimmy Smith appeared to hold Crabtree. Should a flag have been thrown? My take: I had a pretty good view of that play from inside the Superdome, and saw that the official was in a great position to make the call. He was staring it down the whole way. I think he held the flag because it was obvious that even if Smith was nowhere near Crabtree, the receiver wasn\u2019t going to catch that ball. Kaepernick, who was blitzed by the Baltimore defense and under pressure, just overthrew him. Good call. San Francisco fans: feel free to rail on me in the comments. 4. Was Jim Harbaugh a bad sport after the game? The winning coach, John Harbaugh, spent the postgame praising his younger brother \u2013 Jim, coach of the 49ers. John called Jim the best coach in the NFL, talked about how he was devastated that a family member had to suffer a Super Bowl loss. Jim, on the other hand, griped about the refs. \u201cI really want to handle this with class,\u201d he said, \u201c[but] there is no question in my mind that there was a pass interference and a hold on Crabtree on the last one.\u201d I\u2019ll give Jim a pass on this one: he\u2019s an intense guy, and his team just lost the Super Bowl. Brotherly love didn\u2019t need to be on his mind. Sure they\u2019ll bro-hug it out later. 5. But seriously, that power outage \u2013 could it cost New Orleans a future Super Bowl? NFL commissioner Roger Goodell had to be sweating out the power outage Sunday night. It was eerie, and seemed to drag on forever. You couldn\u2019t help but wonder if the NFL was about to face unprecedented disaster. Lights are not always easy to turn on, especially in a 70,000 seat stadium. What was the league going to do? Wait it out until midnight? Make everyone come back the next day? Super Bowl Sunday, finished on a Monday? The horror! Luckily, things got sorted out just in time. But will the league risk coming back to the Superdome for the big game? At a press conference Monday morning, Goodell said the blackout would have no impact on future New Orleans bids \u2013 the city plans on bidding for the 2018 Super Bowl. I hope, and bet, that Goodell sticks to his word here. New Orleans is the perfect host city. The residents could not be friendlier, everything is convenient, the food and fun seemed to put everyone in a good mood. You can make a case for making the Big Easy the Super Bowl\u2019s permanent home. Prediction: the Super Bowl will be back in New Orleans. Sans blackout. As for Beyonc\u00e9 \u2026",

But the Butte County district attorney's office said it plans to continue prosecuting the case. On Monday, sheriff's deputies arrested Lawson Rankin, 29, at his Oroville home after being sent to check on the welfare of a woman at the house. Authorities said they came upon him while he was sealing the entrance to the attic with his wife still inside. Rankin \"denied that his wife was present, told us the wife was not there and hadn't seen her since August,\" said Lt. Alan Smith of the Sheriff's Department. Deputies say they noticed Rankin was covered in drywall mud and saw an area in the kitchen that still had wet drywall on it. Deputies broke the drywall seal and found the woman they were looking for in the attic. \"The victim told the sheriff's office that he sealed her up in the attic to prevent her from testifying about some crimes and a sexual assault he had committed,\" said Mike Ramsey of the Butte County district attorney's office. The woman told deputies that Rankin had held her captive for two weeks and sexually assaulted her several times. She told authorities she had also been beaten on a daily basis and was afraid to leave. Deputies say Rankin had also been issued a domestic violence restraining order earlier in 2012. Rankin was arrested on suspicion of torture, false imprisonment, domestic battery, spousal rape, witness intimidation and violation of a court order. He was booked into the Butte County Jail and is being held without bail. But now, his wife has recanted and has told prosecutors she does not want to testify. She now says she was in the attic so that Rankin would not get in trouble with his parole officer, according to authorities. District Attorney Mike Ramsey said his office will move forward with the case against Rankin. He said there have been three separate domestic abuse incidents involving the couple in the last year and a half. In one case, the woman showed up with a black eye, but refused to testify against Rankin. \"It's not unusual for victims of domestic violence that have been severely injured, that are still in love with their abuser and when law enforcement comes and gets them out of the situation, they change their story around,\" Ramsey said.

        "article": "Kenny Chesney has played a lot of shows at Gillette Stadium; when the second of this weekend\u2019s pair ends late Saturday, the count will be 13. But this year\u2019s model is a little different, in that Chesney has a co-headliner, Jason Aldean. The merging of their two stadium tours has occurred periodically over the summer, and things were carefully calibrated to suggest equal status for the headliners (the media guideline materials for the shows included the request that the tour be referred to with the awkward phrase \u201cKenny Chesney\u2019s \u2018The Big Revival Tour\u201d & Jason Aldean\u2019s \u2018Burn It Down 2015\u2019\u201d). But whatever the case elsewhere, on Friday night Chesney turned out to be first among equals. That may have had something to do with where he was. Aldean was first up with a set that included his hit \u201cCrazy Town,\u201d a song about the pursuit of stardom and the life it entails, in which the singer lyrically prays \u201cfor a honky tonk destiny.\u201d That doesn\u2019t quite describe the character of Aldean\u2019s musical destiny. His music, especially on his more recent albums, has been a prime example of what\u2019s come to be known as bro-country, so it was no surprise that his live show was replete with songs \u2014 from \u201cBig Green Tractor\u201d to \u201cTake a Little Ride\u201d to \u201cNight Train\u201d \u2014 about being in a pickup truck with a pretty girl, driving down a dirt road (or getting sidetracked by other stuff and not driving down a dirt road), and the like, all delivered to the sound of pounding drums and screaming guitars. Small-town nostalgia found expression in \u201cTattoos on this Town,\u201d and awkward-white-guy hick hop in \u201c1994.\u201d When Aldean reached back for earlier material such as the hard-luck tale \u201cAmarillo Sky\u201d and the ode to denial \u201cThe Truth,\u201d he found other subject matter, and one could even discern some sweet steel guitar. But the dominant note was that variant of contemporary country that is shot through with recapitulated, stadium-friendly rock. The Georgia singer\u2019s 90 minutes certainly jacked up the near-capacity crowd. But as much as they responded to Aldean, the roar that greeted Chesney at the outset of a performance that stretched to nearly two and a half hours made clear to whom this crowd belonged. Who knows whether Chesney\u2019s competitive juices have led him to turn things up a notch for these double headliner shows, but his opening salvo was \u201cDrink It Up\u201d (sung as Chesney was carried on a suspended swing over the crowd to the stage) which led to \u201cReality,\u201d then \u201cBeer in Mexico,\u201d then \u201cTil It\u2019s Gone,\u201d all played without a break. For the rest, it was many of the usual suspects, including the song he plays nowhere else, \u201cBoston\u201d; a couple more new ones from current release \u201cThe Big Revival\u201d; and the obligatory classic rock cover, this time AC/DC\u2019s \u201cWhole Lotta Rosie\u201d (which the real deal performed on the same spot just a week ago), with vocals courtesy of bass player Harmoni Kelley McCarty. There were plenty of other cameos, too: a couple of members of one of the opening acts, Old Dominion, from David Lee Murphy (Chesney is producing a new record for the \u201890s neo-trad singer and songwriter), and from Aldean, who joined Chesney for an extended encore that ended with Bryan Adams\u2019s \u201cSummer of \u201969.\u201d Throughout, Chesney\u2019s performance \u2014 and the grin that was plastered on his face the whole night \u2014 manifested what he announced after that first run of songs. \u201cAll summer long . . . we have been waiting . . . to see you again,\u201d he said, pausing for emphasis between each clause; \u201cthis stadium is where No Shoes Nation lives.\u201d Friday night, Gillette Stadium was Chesney\u2019s house.

While debate swirls about the validity of the ratings of individual schools, there is broad agreement among educators and public officials \u2014 from U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan to governors to unions \u2014 that the country is failing to adequately train the 200,000 people who become teachers each year. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how to prepare teachers,\u201d said Arthur Levine, former president of Teachers College at Columbia University and author of a scathing critique of teacher preparation. \u201cWe can\u2019t decide whether it\u2019s a craft or a profession. Do you need a lot of education as you would in a profession, or do you need a little bit and then learn on the job, like a craft? I don\u2019t know of any other profession that\u2019s so uncertain about how to educate their professionals.\u201d Many education schools suffer from the same maladies, Levine said. \u201cAdmission standards are low, no connection between clinical work and academic work and some of the faculty haven\u2019t been in a school for years,\u201d he said. The topic has gained urgency, with new research that shows teacher quality is the single most important factor inside a classroom that affects student learning. As baby boomers retire, classrooms increasingly have newly minted teachers at the helm. Amy Grelck, 26, thought she was ready to teach after graduating from the education program at Illinois Wesleyan University in 2009. Then she stepped into a fifth-grade classroom. \u201cI was in shock, really,\u201d said Grelck, whose undergraduate semester as a student teacher in an affluent school did not prepare her for her first full-time job teaching in a high-poverty classroom in Chambord, Ill. \u201cI really loved the [university] program, while I was in it. But I really felt like I needed more of the realities of teaching. I had quite a bit of low-achieving, struggling students that I didn\u2019t know what to do with.\u201d Grelck was faced with a litany of things she didn\u2019t know: How to group kids by ability and teach them math simultaneously; how to manage behavioral problems; how to use data, such as her students\u2019 test scores, to tweak her instruction. She leaned heavily on more experienced teachers at her school who offered coaching and encouragement. \u201cNothing can really prepare you for that first year,\u201d Grelck said. \u201cBut it definitely could have been a lot better if my program had been more focused on the realities that I was going to face.\u201d",

        "article": "Democrats on Monday made their strongest call to date for a congressional investigation into President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s business entanglements and possible conflicts of interest, asking the GOP\u2019s top House investigator to launch a formal probe. Seventeen Democratic members of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee called on the panel\u2019s chairman, Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) to \u201cbegin reviewing [Trump\u2019s] financial arrangements in order to identify and protect against conflicts of interest.\u201d The demand, in a seven-page letter, comes two weeks after the committee\u2019s ranking Democrat, Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), made a similar request to Chaffetz. That request, according to the Democrats, did not receive a reply. A spokeswoman for Chaffetz did not return a request for comment Monday. \u201cYou have the authority to launch a committee investigation, and we are calling on you to use that power now,\u201d Cummings and 16 other Democrats wrote. \u201cYou acted with unprecedented urgency to hold \u2018emergency\u2019 hearings and issue multiple unilateral subpoenas to investigate [Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton] before the election. We ask that you show the same sense of urgency now.\u201d [Investigate Trump\u2019s potential conflicts of interest, top Dem tells Chaffetz] The Democrats said their phone lines have been \u201cflooded\u201d by supporters of an investigation into Trump\u2019s business dealings, \u201cjamming our phone lines with more calls than we have ever received in response to any other issue.\u201d Their letter asks Chaffetz to request copies of Trump\u2019s income tax returns and to invite Trump aides to brief lawmakers on \u201ctheir plans for protecting against conflicts of interest.\u201d It cites multiple news reports raising questions about whether Trump would be able to keep his business dealings at arm\u2019s length as long as his children continue running his companies under the Trump Organization umbrella. The Washington Post, for example, reported that at least 111 Trump companies have done business in 18 countries and territories \u2014 creating a panoply of potential ethical pitfalls as Trump takes the nation\u2019s foreign policy reins. Donald Trump has a lot of potential conflicts of interest as president \u2013 but there's no law that specifically requires a commander in chief to remove themselves from all of their business interests. The Fix's Peter W. Stevenson explains why presidents usually put their assets in a \"blind trust\" to avoid problems. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) [A scramble to assess the dangers of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s global business empire] The concerns also land closer to home: Trump\u2019s new Washington hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue NW is operated in a government-owned building under a lease with the General Services Administration. Neither Trump nor the GSA have indicated how they plan to eliminate or mitigate a possible conflict of interest, and there are already indications that the hotel is a prominent venue for those seeking to curry favor with the incoming president. Before Trump\u2019s win on Nov. 8, Chaffetz had pledged to continue vigorous investigating of Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. Afterward, he said the email investigation would continue. \u201cI still have a duty and obligation to get to the truth about one of the largest breaches of security at the State Department,\u201d he said on Nov. 9. Chaffetz has not publicly addressed how he intends to handle questions about Trump\u2019s business dealings. Generally speaking, except in the most egregious circumstances, congressional investigators tend to handle presidents of their own parties with kid gloves. In an interview with the Daily Caller earlier this month, Chaffetz said it was his panel\u2019s \u201cjob and responsibility . . . to oversee all expenditures by the executive branch, no matter who the president is.\u201d Last week, the Salt Lake Tribune, the largest paper in Chaffetz\u2019s home state, called on him to vigorously investigate Trump\u2019s finances. \u201cChaffetz, Cummings, their committee, Congress and the American people need to know if Trump will, or even might be tempted to, manage domestic, foreign, military and trade policy in ways that put his own interests ahead of those of the nation or its people,\u201d the paper wrote.",

        "article": "Car2go, the Daimler-owned car-sharing company, says it has gained early traction in China after debuting its service there less than two months ago. The company says it has more than 78,000 registered customers for its membership service, which lets users rent a car for short periods of time, in many cases for less than an hour. Car2go has 400 of its two-door Smart ForTwo vehicles in the Chongqing region, a 60-square-kilometer area of 30 million people in central China. It is Car2go\u2019s only location in Asia. The number of registered users might seem small compared to area\u2019s overall population. But it took Car2go four to five years to reach 100,000 to 130,000 registered customers in the company\u2019s most successful cities in Europe and North America. Car2go CEO Roland Keppler said the start in Chongqing far exceeded the company\u2019s expectations without elaborating or explaining what he had thought demand would be. The company estimates that one of the 400 vehicles available in Chongqing is rented every 1.7 minutes. \u201cThe Chinese customers are really enthusiastic about the service and make intensive use of the vehicles,\u201d Keppler said in a statement. Car2go operates in nine U.S. cities, as well as in metropolitan area in Austria, Canada, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, and Sweden. Asia-Pacific has some of the greatest potential for car-sharing and other unconventional transportation services like peer-to-peer car rentals, according to a report released earlier this year by Boston Consulting Group. It\u2019s a region where the cost of ownership, including license plates and user permits, is high, especially in urban areas like some of China\u2019s biggest cities. Densely populated cities that have car-sharing friendly policies like designated parking areas as well as a high cost of owning a car are critical for this kind of service to thrive. In Asia-Pacific, where per capita incomes are generally lower than the U.S. and Europe and the transportation infrastructure is less developed, car-sharing will be economically viable in cities with populations of 5 million or more, according to the Boston Consulting Group report. Asia-Pacific will nonetheless be the largest market in absolute terms, because of its large and growing population, the report says. In China alone, the 15 largest cities have 9 million people or more. Daimler, probably best known as the company behind Mercedes-Benz, has been expanding beyond its car manufacturing roots to serve a growing number of people who would rather use mass transit, on-demand car-sharing services, and ride-hailing apps like Lyft. The company also created a subsidiary called Moovel Group that has been busy snapping up transportation-related app startups including route planner RideScout, taxi booking app Mytaxi, and mobile ticketing app GlobeSherpa. The Moovel app combines all local public transport options, car-sharing providers Car2go and Flinkster, mytaxi, rental bicycles, and Germany\u2019s national rail service. Moovel Group announced in April that Austin-based RideScout had merged with Portland-based GlobeSherpa to form a North American arm called Moovel. The newly formed company is integrating its collection of transportation services into a more streamlined service app that lets users get real-time data about public transit schedules, buy tickets, and order a ride through Lyft. Mercedes Benz\u2019s answer to Google\u2019s driverless car: In September, Car2go aligned itself closer to the Mercedes Benz by adding 75 four-door Mercedes-Benz B-class vehicles to its fleet in Calgary, Toronto, and Vancouver. The program is designed to offer members an alternative to the car-sharing company\u2019s signature vehicle: the diminutive Smart Fortwo vehicle, which is also made by Daimler.",

        "article": "Editor's note: John P. Avlon is senior political columnist for The Daily Beast and author of the new book \"Wingnuts: How the Lunatic Fringe is Hijacking America.\" New York (CNN) -- Today's bipartisan health care meeting is being called a summit, a term that brings to mind diplomatic missions during wartime. That's a fitting description for the atmosphere in Washington. Political opponents are considered enemies. Health care is just the latest example of government dysfunction; it's been derailed by hyper-partisanship, over-spending and the disproportionate influence of special interests. Independent voters, the largest and fastest growing segment of the electorate, hold the balance of power in American politics, but they have once again been shut out of the debate. The professional partisans in Washington ignore them at their peril. Many Americans associate broken government with the chaos that followed Hurricane Katrina and the anxieties that accompany the current manic recession. But the roots of independent voters' frustration go deeper. For them, the first modern evidence of failure from the federal government came during the late 1960s, when the social spending of Democratic President Johnson's Great Society failed to stop urban blight by throwing taxpayer money at the problem. One presidency later, the country confronted the corruption of Watergate from Republican President Nixon. Washington grew more harshly partisan, with political opponents determined to delegitimize any president from day one of his term. As the two parties grew more polarized, power shifted from the center to the margins, and special interests increased their influence. In reaction, the ranks of independent voters grew from 20 percent of the electorate at the start of the 1960s to 30 percent after Watergate. When Ross Perot ran for president as an Independent in 1992, the self-made businessman presented himself as a nonideological problem solver. His campaign gained traction because both parties had lost credibility as stewards of fiscal responsibility, with overspending and then-record deficits. Perot briefly led in the polls, and independents spiked to 36 percent of the electorate. The divided government of President Clinton and House Speaker Newt Gingrich ultimately produced hard-won budget surpluses. But when President Bush and the Tom DeLay-led Republican Congress ruled Washington during the last decade, surpluses again turned to deficits and independents turned against the GOP. Independents listed the economy as their No. 1 issue back in 2007, when Democrats said health care and Republicans said terrorism. Moderates and the middle class -- the people who determine who wins elections -- felt squeezed even before the fiscal crisis, with rising health care and energy costs absorbing whatever benefit they might have received from tax cuts. After watching the jet set excess of the Bernie Madoff class from afar, they were left with less and still asked to clean up the mess. Now, as they try to balance their own budgets at home, they see big government and big business --Washington and Wall Street -- piling up huge debts and passing the buck to the taxpayer. It was in this environment that independents began to break with President Obama last spring, after voting for him in 2008 by an eight-point margin. The change they voted for was rooted in candidate Obama's calls for an end to politics that \"played to the base\" and a restoration of fiscal responsibility. The liberal House leadership's private negotiations over the $787 billion stimulus bill seemed to contradict those promises. And the subsequent health care debate was derailed in part because it was seen as adding additional spending and leading to the growth of government. In reaction, independents reasserted themselves, their numbers growing quickly and reaching 43 percent by September 2009, according to a monthly Washington Post/ABC News poll. In Virginia, New Jersey and Massachusetts' elections, independents voted by at least a 2-to-1 margin for Republican candidates. Exit polls showed they were voting to send a message to Washington, not necessarily endorsing the Congressional Republicans' agenda. Independents' anger today is focused on familiar targets: hypocritical politicians, over-spending and a lack of agreement on solutions from Washington. Independents feel they are paying more and getting less. They believe the system has been rigged to benefit special interests at the expense of the national interest. As bitter partisanship increases government's dysfunction, more voters are declaring their independence from politics as usual. Today's bipartisan health care summit is a step in the right direction. Independent voters want to see the warring parties in Washington speaking to each other in the presence of television cameras, ensuring at least a degree of civility and accountability. It's more difficult to demonize the opposition when talking with them. But photo-op centrism is, of course, not enough. It must be followed by substance. To really change the culture of Washington, we need to change the rules that reinforce this predictable partisanship. The quickest policy cure would be to change the rigged system of redistricting that creates congressional 'safe seats' and replaces competitive general elections with closed primaries, where party activists reign supreme. Nonpartisan redistricting and open primaries would reward politicians who reach across the aisle, and would empower independent voters. Americans' sense that government is broken didn't happen overnight, and it won't be solved overnight. It will take time to restore trust in Washington. But substantive efforts to depolarize our politics will lead to the politics of problem solving. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.",

        "article": "But after weeks of amiable optimism, Republicans who emerged from a two-hour meeting of the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday volunteered sharp-edged political comments. Senator Pat Roberts, Republican of Kansas, said Republicans were being pressed by Democrats to support tax increases to pay for a bill they had not seen, with an unknown price tag. \u201cI\u2019d like to see a bill,\u201d Mr. Roberts said. \u201cAll I\u2019ve seen is slide shows. After every show, I send the information to our health care providers. Then, after cardiac arrest, they come back and say, \u2018Whoa, wait a minute, how is this going to affect doctors, hospitals, home health care, clinical laboratories, pharmacists, ambulance drivers?\u2019 \u201d The Democratic bill is likely to include a requirement for people to carry health insurance, subsidies for those who cannot afford it, and a requirement for employers to contribute to the cost. Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, said he feared that Democrats, with a solid majority in the Senate and strong support from President Obama, would ignore Republican concerns about a big expansion in the role of government. Mr. Hatch predicted that such an approach would meet the same fate as President Bill Clinton\u2019s plan for universal coverage. \u201cIf the Democrats go ahead with a purely partisan bill,\u201d Mr. Hatch said, \u201cyou saw what happened on Hillarycare, and this will be just as bad.\u201d Mr. Grassley said many Republicans agreed that Americans should be required to have \u201cinsurance of some kind or another.\u201d But he said he and other Republican senators did not believe the government should require employers to provide or pay for coverage of their employees. Creation of a new government insurance plan remains the most contentious issue in the debate. \u201cA bill that passes the Senate will have some version of a public option,\u201d Mr. Baucus predicted on Thursday. \u201cIf there is a public plan, we have to make sure it does not set prices, there really is competition and the government\u2019s thumb is very, very light.\u201d Mr. Grassley said, \u201cIf there is a solution here, it\u2019s got to be one that does not have the government setting prices or unfair competition.\u201d But he also said: \u201cOur caucus is very, very much against a public option. It\u2019s kind of a litmus test.\u201d In a letter to senators on Wednesday, Mr. Obama came down strongly in favor of \u201ca public health insurance option operating alongside private plans.\u201d Mr. Grassley said Mr. Obama\u2019s letter \u201cwas not helpful.\u201d Mr. Baucus and Mr. Grassley agreed that Congress was likely, in the end, to limit the decades-old tax break for employer-provided health insurance. Revenues raised from this change could help finance coverage of the uninsured, proponents say. But much more money would be needed. \u201cWhen you look at what the Democrats want to do, the costs are astronomical,\u201d Mr. Hatch said.

        "article": "The Colorado teen accused of brutally murdering 10-year-old Jessica Ridgeway makes his first court appearance. NBC's Chris Clackum reports. By NBC News staff and wire services Updated at 1:01 p.m. ET: A Colorado teenager has confessed to the abduction and killing of a 10-year-old girl and in a separate attack on a runner, prosecutors said Thursday. Austin Reed Sigg, 17, made his first court appearance Thursday in the death of Jessica Ridgeway and an assault on a 22-year-old female runner in May. Authorities said Thursday they have \"overwhelming\" DNA evidence against Sigg. Sigg lived about a mile from Jessica Ridgeway, who disappeared Oct. 5 while walking to school in Westminster, a suburb northwest of Denver. Her body, which police said was \"not intact,\" was found five days later in a park in Arvada, about 9 miles from her home. Sigg made his first court appearance Thursday, shackled in a turquoise jumpsuit. He kept his head bowed for much of the time and asked only one question during the hearing, which was for clarification on his rights as a defendant. The judge told Sigg to consult with his attorneys for clarification, which he briefly did, then nodded to the judge to apparently indicate that he understood. In arguing to deny bail to Sigg, Jefferson County Deputy District Attorney Hal Sargent said that investigators have obtained \"a confession and DNA evidence.\" \"The evidence is overwhelming,\" he said. A police custody report released on Wednesday said Sigg waived his right to counsel when investigators first spoke to him, in another indication he might have discussed the crimes. During the hearing, Sigg made eye contact at one point with relatives of Ridgeway, who were in the courtroom wearing purple ribbons in the girl's memory. Westminster Police Dept. via AP Jessica Ridgeway went missing on her way to school on Oct. 5, 2012. Sigg's mother cried on and off during the proceeding, which lasted about 35 minutes. Security was tight, with 14 armed deputies in court. The judge ordered the teen to be held without bond and set the next court hearing for Tuesday. Sigg is being held on suspicion of first-degree murder, felony murder and kidnapping in Jessica's case, and with criminal attempt to kidnap and murder in a Memorial Day attack on a jogger at Ketner Lake. District Attorney Scott Storey said the law prevents prosecutors from seeking the death penalty because Sigg is a juvenile, even though he is being prosecuted as an adult. Police in the Denver suburb of Westminster said they took Sigg into custody Tuesday night after receiving a phone call, apparently from his mother, that led them to Sigg. Reached by phone, Sigg's mother told The Associated Press he turned himself in. \"I made the phone call, and he turned himself in. That's all I have to say,\" said Mindy Sigg, before she broke down in tears and hung up. Authorities said Sigg, who is a student at Arapahoe Community College, also will face charges in the May 28 attempted kidnapping of the 22-year-old runner at the Ketner Lake Open Space. Police have said the two crimes are connected but haven't elaborated. Jogger: Stranger put rag over my mouthIn the May case, a woman fought off a stranger who grabbed her from behind and put a rag that smelled of chemicals over her mouth, authorities said. Police haven't determined if the substance on the rag was meant to subdue the woman. Authorities have released few details about their investigation, and court documents have been sealed. A police custody report said Sigg was cooperative when he was arrested and waived his rights. Acquaintances have said Sigg was interested in mortuary science and forensic science, often wore black and hung out in the high school cafeteria's \"goth corner.\" Sigg had attended Witt Elementary, but he moved on to middle school in 2007, before Jessica enrolled at Witt, Jefferson County Public Schools spokeswoman Lynn Setzer said. Sigg later attended Standley Lake High School while also taking classes at Warren Tech, a district school that offers specialized training in health science, public safety, technology and other fields. He left the school district in July after finishing the 11th grade and later earned a GED. School officials don't know why he left. Arapahoe Community College officials confirmed Sigg is enrolled there but wouldn't release other details. Sigg's ex-girlfriend told 9NEWS.com Sigg having a hard time coming to grips with what he is accused of. \"The Austin I knew would never have done anything like that,\" the ex-girlfriend, who the TV station identified only as \"Danni,\" said. \"He was my first boyfriend. He was my first kiss. He was my first date.\" She said she doesn't remember any warning signs, but said Sigg did have a collection of weapons. \"I knew he had a sword collection in his room or a knife collection or whatever. But it was his man cave. A lot of people collect stuff,\" Danni said, according to 9NEWS.com. The Associated Press, Reuters and NBC producer Kevin Watters contributed to this story.

        "article": "LONDON, July 17 (Reuters) - A would-be leader of Libya's $67 billion sovereign wealth fund warned on Friday that conditions were not right to start unfreezing and managing the funds assets, speaking out against a rival's plan. The fund has yet to be fully untangled after the ouster of Muammar Gaddafi four years ago. It is at the centre of a bitter power struggle even as its staff are trying to trace those responsible for billions of dollars of missing money. AbdulMagid Breish, once the undisputed leader of the Libyan Investment Authority (LIA) - which has had four chairmen claiming the top job over two years - is meeting with lawyers, journalists and bankers in London with one clear message: do not let anyone tinker with the frozen accounts. \"Not until we have total stability,\" Breish said in an interview with Reuters. Currently Libya is torn between two governments, one based in Tripoli and the second in the east, who have appointed different heads of various institutions, including the state oil company. The resulting chaos has also allowed Islamic State militants to gain a foothold in parts of the country. Breish said any unfreezing of the LIA's assets could jeopardise the money, as the rival governments and factions on the ground scramble for cash in the oil-rich state. \"Not until we have stability on the ground, not until we have unification,\" Breish said of any management of the money. \"Before that, it's too dangerous.\" Breish was speaking out against plans from rival Hassan Bouhadi, who in October 2014 was appointed as head of the fund by the internationally recognised government based in eastern Libya. Breish claims to have been reinstated as head of the LIA by Libya's Court of Appeal. Bouhadi was in London last week appealing for exemptions to sanctions that have frozen the group's investments since 2011. The pair, reluctantly and via lawyers, joined forces earlier this month to take on Goldman Sachs and Societe Generale which the LIA has sued for more than $3 billion of money it claims was either mismanaged or totally disappeared. Breish said there is around $300 million in foreign bank accounts that the LIA can access, and is using to finance the lawsuits that are unfolding against Goldman and others. Another 10 billion Libyan dinars are on deposit with local banks, Breish said, but he insisted it is impossible under current law for any government or institution to use that money. \"We have kept saying all along that LIA cannot give money to anyone,\" Breish said. A central bank official in Tripoli told Reuters in May the bank was allowed to use LIA cash to tackle a budget crisis caused by a shortfall of oil revenues. Breish said roughly 60 percent of its Libyan held funds are deposited with the Central Bank, but there are no loans coming from it - and that the LIA can withdraw its funds at any time. He said any further money, including returns from frozen accounts, is not available to himself or Bouhadi. The returns on the account, which Bouhadi put at 5-7 percent per year, Breish says are impossible to state without a fresh audit of the 550 companies in which the fund holds stakes. For now, Breish will continue unravelling LIA assets and tracing those he believes were mismanaged or pilfered before 2011, and beefing up LIA staff with accountants and an expanded litigation team to take on others, in Libya and abroad, who he believes are responsible for nearly $2 billion more of missing LIA money, he said. The one fight he is not gearing up for is his rivalry for the chairmanship. \"In the next couple of weeks or months, there will be a government of national unity. There won't be any Tobruk government, there won't be any Tripoli government,\" Breish said. The rival leadership, he believes, will \"vanish into thin air.\" (Additional reporting by Ulf Laessing; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle)",

        "article": "May 4, 2016 5:00 AM EDT Health By Mary Brophy Marcus / CBS News Medical errors, including wrong diagnoses, botched surgeries and medication mistakes, are the third leading cause of death in the United States, a new study suggests. Scientists from Johns Hopkins found that more than 250,000 Americans die due to medical mishaps every year, greater than the toll from any major medical condition except heart disease or cancer. The findings, published in The BMJ, come from an analysis of death rate records spanning eight years. Study author Dr. Martin Makary, surgical director of the Johns Hopkins Multidisciplinary Pancreas Clinic and a professor of surgery at Johns Hopkins Medicine, said rates for deaths related to \"medical care gone awry\" aren't tracked in a standardized way. Because of that, deaths due to medical errors aren't tallied in the same way as heart disease, cancer and other conditions are when it comes to national statistics on causes of death. Makary told CBS News that national mortality statistics are calculated using billing codes, which don't have a built-in way to recognize incidence rates of mortality due to medical errors. For the study, Makary and his colleagues evaluated four separate studies that analyzed medical death rate data from 2000 to 2008, including one by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office of the Inspector General and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Based on 2013 data on hospitalization rates, they found that of 35,416,020 hospitalizations, 251,454 deaths stemmed from a medical error. They said that adds up to 9.5 percent of all deaths a year in the U.S. According to CDC data, heart disease is the current leading cause of death in the U.S., killing more than 611,000 people per year. Cancer comes in second with more than 584,000 deaths. The new research would place medical errors at a solid third place -- ahead of respiratory disease, which is responsible for almost 150,000 annual deaths. But there's a Catch-22 when it comes to committing resources to reduce the problem of medical errors. \"One of the big issues that we in the patient safety research field face, that we run up against, is a problem where there's very little funding for research in making care safer and better. Part of the problem is that our national funding is informed from our national health statistics. But those statistics don't recognize medical care gone awry as a cause of death,\" said Makary. As the stats reflect, cancer and heart disease get more funding and attention. Medical errors can take a number of different forms, including diagnostic errors -- missing the correct diagnosis due to substandard evaluation of a patient -- and drug mishaps. Unnecessary surgery, not calling in a specialist when one is needed, and missing life-threatening conditions such as septic shock also feed into the problem. Most such instances reflect system-wide problems, such as poorly coordinated care and inconsistencies in insurance coverage, among other issues, and cannot simply be blamed on \"bad\" doctors. \"Human error is inevitable. But while we cannot eliminate human error, we can better measure the problem to design safer systems mitigating its frequency, visibility, and consequences,\" Makary wrote in the study. The first step to reducing the problem, he suggests, is to deal with it more openly when things go wrong: \"Make errors more visible when they occur, so their effects can be intercepted.\" \"We've spent a tremendous effort tracking cancer, by state, by subtype, and we report all that to our national cancer registry. But we don't do any of that for people who die of medical error gone wrong,\" said Makary.",

        "article": "Spainish Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba warned that ETA could strike soon. Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- The Basque separatist group ETA could be a planning a major attack or a high-profile kidnapping, Spain's Interior Minister warned publicly this week, and the government raised its nationwide terrorism alert to \"level two.\" \"A kidnapping would be a spectacular action and would bring media attention to ETA that it lacks at this time,\" Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said Monday. He repeated the warning in a Basque radio interview on Tuesday shortly before his ministry increased the alert level. A few thousand people in Spain's northern Basque region have police or private bodyguards due to threats by ETA, which is blamed for more than 800 deaths in its long fight for Basque independence. Those who have bodyguards include many public officials, even down to the level of town councilors, and judges, as well as some business executives, teachers, journalists and doctors. ETA, listed as a terrorist group by Spain, the European Union and the United States, has carried out high-profile kidnappings before. Some ended in death for the hostages, including a town councilman; while police rescued others, including a prison guard held hostage for nearly one and a half years. Rubalcaba's unusual public warning about a possible ETA attack or kidnapping brought criticism from some in the main opposition conservative Popular Party and police officer unions. But others praised the warning as way to reinforce security for the nation. The Interior Ministry said in a statement that the level two terrorism alert \"implies a probable risk of a terrorist attack.\" The increased alert includes more police scrutiny at transit hubs and other public places. The highest alert is level four, when armed forces are deployed against an imminent threat of attack, an Interior Ministry spokeswoman said. The ministry statement said the alert was raised to level two after reviewing police intelligence, for various reasons: the Christmas holiday season, Spain's upcoming role as the rotating European Union president for the first half of 2010, and the \"persistent international terrorist threat seen in incidents like the flight from Amsterdam to the United States.\" Spanish media on Wednesday cited police intelligence reports that warn of two possible ETA attacks, but the warning lacks specific targets or dates when they might occur. Police this year have arrested about 70 ETA suspects in Spain and France, ETA's traditional rearguard base just across the border, officials said. That includes the arrest in October of a suspected top ETA leader, the fifth time since May 2008 that a suspected ETA chief operative has been detained. ETA, founded in 1959, is an acronym for Euskadi ta Askatasuna, which means \"Basque Homeland and Liberty\" in the Basque language. Rubalcaba said in a Basque radio interview Tuesday that \"ETA is in a weak situation. It's been hit hard by the police and the courts. It's isolated socially, and has infighting in its ranks. In these circumstances, it's easy to predict that ETA is thinking of demonstrating that it's alive, that it exists.\"",

        "article": "Meerkat, a new San Francisco-based app that launched February 27, hopes to lead that charge. Users can \"meerkat\" (yes, it's become a verb) by downloading the free iOS app, which connects to a Twitter account (it's required to have one). Meerkat users can see who's watching and engage with them on the app. Though the startup is just two weeks old, Israeli entrepreneur Ben Rubin has spent years working on livestreaming startups. He intended to launch Meerkat as part of his livestreaming firm Life on Air Inc. (which was itself a pivot from his startup Yevvo). Days after launching Meerkat though, Rubin, 27, took to Twitter to announce that he was devoting his startup's resources solely to Meerkat. On Tuesday alone, people watched 30,000 different streams, according to Meerkat community director Ryan Cooley, who declined to disclose downloads but said streams are increasing each day. There are users in 156 countries, though 75% of usage is in the U.S. The startup has already attracted big names. Spotify's Daniel Ek meerkat'ed a tour of the company's Stockholm office. Jared Leto livestreamed a chat with fans from Russia. Angel investor Paige Craig used it to stream a Los Angeles policeman harassing his Lyft driver; and the Miami Dolphins introduced defensive star Ndamnukong Suh to its team via Meerkat. Meerkat has already infiltrated the lexicon here at CNN. (\"Anytime you're up for meerkating, just let me know,\" was literally overheard in the newsroom as I typed.) Two of our tech reporters have a daily meerkat date to chat about their stories. Outlets like CNBC, Nasdaq and PBS have all signed up. Because of its integration with Twitter (TWTR, Tech30), some suggested Meerkat could be an obvious acquisition. But the social media giant recently acquired Periscope, a mobile livestreaming service still in beta, which Periscope confirmed via Twitter Friday. Also on Friday, just as SXSW kicked off, Twitter said it was \"limiting\" Meerkat's access to Twitter's social graph in a move \"consistent with our internal policy,\" according to an email statement from a Twitter spokesperson. \"Their users will still be able to distribute videos on Twitter and log in with their Twitter credentials,\" according to the statement. Twitter's integration was a huge part of Meerkat's appeal, since users could auto-follow Twitter connections on Meerkat and were notified when new Twitter friends joined. Meerkat declined to comment but Rubin took to Twitter to express his thoughts. \"twitter's move here shows how significant meerkat has become,\" he wrote in a series of tweets. \"And lastly, THIS is just the beginning for Meerkat. --The revolution will be live streamed.\" Venture capitalist Mark Suster also tweeted: \"I hope more people will use @AppMeerkat as a sign that people care about innovation & don't reward network clampdowns.\" If livestreaming doesn't sound that new to you, it's because it's not. Video-sharing startup Qik tried to make it mainstream years ago (it was eventually bought by Skype). Eden Shochat, partner at VC firm Aleph which led the investment in Rubin's Yevvo, said the \"bandwidth, camera quality, battery power\" make it a better time for a product like this. \"I'm quite certain that video that allows you to participate with your viewers is here to stay,\" said Shochat. \"You've got the Snapchat generation where people are used to unedited, unpolished content,\" he said. \"[Now] it's much easier to deliver livestreaming,\" he said.

        "article": "B\u00c3\u00a9atrice de G\u00c3\u00a9a for The New York Times Long Island City\u00e2\u0080\u0099s changing skyline as seen from Midtown Manhattan. IT\u2019S got sushi bars. A teahouse. An upscale grocery store. A cocktail lounge where the word \u201cmixologist\u201d could reasonably be uttered. Multiple options for doggy day care. It\u2019s one stop from Manhattan, the views are fabulous, and, joy to the world, there are no alternate-side parking rules. With all that and more, has Long Island City, 30 years after it was first labeled \u201chot,\u201d finally become a self-sustaining neighborhood? The evidence that this semi-industrial section of Queens is approaching some kind of critical mass is growing. More than a dozen new and converted condominium developments have opened in recent years, and several are sold out. And while thousands of housing units have appeared, a huge number of others \u2014 5,000 or more \u2014 are due to be delivered by both public and private enterprises in the coming years. Prices are rising, too, having mostly recovered from a dip during the Lehman Brothers slump. Though values for condos have not approached the levels of those in sister neighborhoods across the river in Manhattan, it\u2019s not uncommon to pay more than $700 a square foot in Long Island City. Rentals in new buildings aren\u2019t cheap, either; monthly lease rates in some ascend to heights of $3,000 and beyond (but come with unfettered vistas of Midtown, of course). Perhaps more important for the new residents paying those prices, the list of local amenities is far longer than it was five years ago. Psychic changes are afoot, too. Consider the great McDonald\u2019s scare of 2010, wherein the blog liQcity.com posted an item about the Golden Arches\u2019 landing a spot on Vernon Boulevard, the main drag. The response was swift and, tellingly, of the type you might expect in a place like Park Slope or Northside Williamsburg. \u201cBe prepared for fat lazy people discarding their burger wrappers on the street as they leave the restaurant,\u201d one commenter wrote. \u201cPlease let this be a joke,\u201d said another, repeating the thought three times for emphasis. It was indeed a joke \u2014 the blogger, Nancy Verma, quickly informed her readers that they were all April fools. But back in 1980, when New York magazine labeled Long Island City the city\u2019s \u201cnext hot neighborhood,\u201d it would have been impossible to conceive of coordinated neighborhood scorn for fast food. Heavy industry was the rule then, with residents mostly living in town houses and small apartment buildings. Longtimers like the Cerbone family, which runs the well-known Italian restaurant Manducatis on Jackson Avenue, now share the neighborhood with the still-growing crop of condos. It\u2019s difficult to turn a corner without seeing a new building like the Solarium on 48th Avenue or the Murano on Borden Avenue. The Citylights co-op tower, which sat alone on the waterfront for years, now has a cadre of sleek, glassy neighbors. At the base of one of those buildings, you can buy $13.79 teriyaki swordfish kabobs and truffled Gouda for $25.99 a pound at Foodcellar & Company, a Whole Foods-like grocer that opened in August 2008. (It was followed by a Duane Reade next door, with $23 shampoos and Belgian ales on display.) \u201cFive years ago when we moved here, all around us it was just, like, warehouses and fields,\u201d said Yulia Oleinik, who lives in the Arris Lofts building with her husband, Logi Bragason, and works for Unicef across the river. \u201cNow there is all this variety of buildings and the infrastructure is coming big time. I just feel that the neighborhood is very much alive, and growing.\u201d Ms. Oleinik has tapped into the active artistic community that predates the condos, often taking in plays at underground theaters and shows at small art galleries. She and Mr. Bragason sample cuisine at the annual Taste of Long Island City event and loll by the waterfront in Gantry Plaza State Park, which continues to expand northward along the East River. Yet like others in L.I.C., Ms. Oleinik is worried about the events of the past two years. Around the time of the Lehman Brothers crash, businesses along Vernon Boulevard started to close, prompting residents to wonder whether they were living in a bubble that was about to burst. \u201cWe go through major amenity cycles,\u201d said Ms. Verma, who has lived in the area several years. \u201cThe fall is always an upswing for retail, but in the winter there\u2019s always a little decline. The year before last, I feel like 10 businesses went under.\u201d Today, an empty retail space at the foot of a new residential building is a common sight, as are \u201ccoming soon\u201d signs, like the one on the waterfront advertising a library that remains a vacant lot for lack of financing. Other basic services are missing, as well.",

The report, which called on a large body of scientific evidence, found that global warming of close to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial times \u2013 up from 0.8\u00b0C today \u2013 is already locked into Earth's atmospheric system by past and predicted greenhouse gas emissions. Such an increase could have potentially catastrophic consequences for mankind, causing the global sea level to rise more than 30 centimeters by 2100, droughts to become more severe and placing almost 90 percent of coral reefs at risk of extinction. The World Bank called on scientists at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and Climate Analytics and asked them to look at the likely impacts of present day (0.8\u00b0C), 2\u00b0C and 4\u00b0C warming on agricultural production, water resources, cities and ecosystems across the world. Their findings, collated in the Bank's third report on climate change published on Monday, specifically looked at the risks climate change poses to lives and livelihoods across Latin America and the Caribbean, Eastern Europe and Central Asia, and the Middle East and North Africa. In the report entitled \"Turndown the heat \u2013 Confronting the new climate normal,\" scientists warned that even a seemingly slight rise in global warming could have dramatic effects on us all. Read MoreUN climate changesummit: Politics are 'toxic' \"A world even 1.5\u00b0C [warmer] will mean more severe droughts and global sea level rise, increasing the risk of damage from storm surges and crop loss and raising the cost of adaptation for millions of people,\" the report with multiple authors said. \"These changes are already underway, with global temperatures 0.8 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times, and the impact on food security, water supplies and livelihoods is just beginning.\" As temperatures rise, heat extremes on a par with the heat waves in the U.S. in 2012 and Russia in 2010 will also become more common, scientists believed. \"Everyone will feel the impact, particularly the poor, as weather extremes become more common and risks to food, water, and energy security increase.\" Read MoreObama pledges $3billion for climate change fund Without concerted action to reduce emissions, the report warns that the planet is on pace for 2\u00b0C warming by mid-century and 4\u00b0C or more by the time today's teenagers are in their 80s. A temperature rise of this magnitude would create \"a frightening world of increased risks and global instability,\" the World Bank Group's President Jim Yong Kim said, calling the scientists' findings \"alarming.\" \"Today's report confirms what scientists have been saying \u2013 past emissions have set an unavoidable course of warming over the next two decades, which will affect the world's poorest and most vulnerable people the most,\" Kim said. \"Climate change impacts such as extreme heat events may now be unavoidable,\" he added. The effects of climate change are already starting to impact on mankind, the president noted, with record-breaking temperatures occurring more frequently, rainfall increasing in intensity in some places, while drought-prone regions like the Mediterranean are getting dryer. A significant increase in tropical North Atlantic cyclone activity is affecting the Caribbean and Central America. Read More7 industries at greatest risk from climate change The new report comes on the heels of strong new warnings from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) about the pace of climate change and the energy transformations necessary to stay within 2\u00b0C warming. Earlier in November, China and the U.S. signed a landmark agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 but there are fears those curbs don't go far enough to slow the onslaught of global warming. There are still many prominent and influential climate change skeptics to convince too. Global governments are gathering in Lima, Peru at the start of December for the next round of climate negotiations.

The industry across the ocean worries that TripAdvisor and similar sites - sites that rely on anonymous reviews - yield too much power, the story says. The concern had existed before, but TripAdvisor's Dirtiest Hotels list made it an even hotter topic in the past week, the article says. TripAdvisor's \"Dirtiest Hotels\" list for the USA was such as a talker on Hotel Check-In last week that the post attracted a whopping 276 comments. Bob Cotton, CEO of the British Hospitality Association, told the Independent that hotels across Europe are lobbying the EU Commission to rewrite the rules governing website reviews. The goal? Make sure they're legitimate - and not written by rivals. \"Websites have a responsibility that the person has actually stayed at the hotel or dined at the restaurant,\" Cotton told the Independent. \"I have been having discussions in Brussels on behalf of the industry so that some sort of common sense should prevail, as it does on sites such as eBay. \"You can't ban these on-line comments \u2013 that is like de-inventing the atomic bomb \u2013 and I am in favour of all these methods of modern communication. But we need a fair crack of the whip,\" said Cotton. He said he's aware of some cases in which a hotel owner had been double-crossed by a competitor who wrote a series of disparaging comments about the rival hotel. The owner of the two-star, seaside Grosvenor Hotel - named by TripAdvisor as Britain's No. 1 \"dirtiest hotel\" - criticized TripAdvisor's methodology. Hotel owner Chirag Khajuria told the Independent that out of the 3,000 guests he'd had in the six months since he'd taken over the hotel, the hotel had 35 poor reviews \"and some of our guests have said they would be back again to stay,\" according to the article. When the Daily Mail wrote up the hotel's ranking on the list, it said that the rooms there were \"no worse \u2013 and, in some cases, better \u2013 than many other hotels in Britain,\" according to the Independent's article.

Before the 10th-ranked Bears beat SMU 45-0 in their first game at McLane Stadium on Sunday night, a 9 1/2-foot bronze statue of Robert Griffin III was unveiled. The statue of Baylor's only Heisman Trophy winner is in a plaza between the stadium and the Brazos River, where some fans arrived by boat for the game -- and others dived in for relief from temperatures in the mid-90s. That plaza is at the end of a 775-foot pedestrian bridge over the water that many fans walk over to get to the stadium. \"If you go to Washington D.C., before you go watch the Redskins and Robert, you go see Mr. Lincoln. That's a great statue. If you're going to go to New York City, go see the Statue of Liberty,\" Ken Starr, the school's president, said during a dedication ceremony. \"When you come to Waco, you're going to see the statue of Judge Baylor, Coach (Grant) Teaff and Robert Griffin III.\" Griffin won the Heisman Trophy in 2011, the same season Baylor won 10 games for the first time since its outright 1980 Southwest Conference title. RG3 played his home games in Floyd Casey Stadium, about 4 1/2 miles from campus, where the Bears were for 64 seasons through last year. It was during Griffin's last season at Baylor before being the second overall pick in the NFL draft that the idea of a new campus stadium really took off and donations started pouring in to make that a reality. The Bears hadn't played on the Waco campus since 1935 before Sunday night's game against SMU. \"No, it wasn't just me. If you look at the guys who came in with me, the guys who were there before we got here. They are all part of it, from Grant Teaff to coach (Art) Briles,\" Griffin said, before starting to name a long list of his Bears teammates. \"They know we couldn't have done it without each other.\" Sporting a dark green coat representing a primary Baylor color, the Washington Redskins quarterback said he never dreamed of having a statue. Former U.S. President George W. Bush hugs Robert Griffin III before Monday's game between Baylor and SMU. RG3 was also honored with a statue outside McLane Stadium. \"It's incredible. People are excited about football. I don't know if we could have said that many years ago when coach Briles and myself and our first class got here,\" Griffin said. \"Now we have a lot of guys in the NFL. We've got a stadium on campus and the future is very bright. But this is only the beginning. There's much more to come.\" Fans chanted \"RG3! RG3!\" during the statue ceremony more than three hours before kickoff. There were more of those chants after he was introduced on the field to give the opening prayer, in which at one point he exclaimed \"Wow!\" Griffin and Starr were at midfield for the coin toss by former President George W. Bush, who has a ranch in nearby Crawford and lives primarily in Dallas, where his presidential library is on the SMU campus. Starr got on campus after an 8:30 a.m. church service, and quickly took a stroll across the long pedestrian bridge. \"It's beyond our expectations,\" Starr said.

        "article": "* June core orders -7.9 pct m/m vs f'cast -5.6 pct * Q3 core orders seen +0.3 pct qtr/qtr vs Q2 +2.9 pct * Manufacturers' orders -14.0 pct; Service sector +0.6 * Govt maintains view that core orders are \"picking up\" TOKYO, Aug 13 (Reuters) - Japan's core machinery orders tumbled the most in over a year, adding to fears of an economic contraction in the second quarter as exports slumped and consumer spending slackened. The 7.9 percent fall in the key gauge of capital spending followed a recent run of soft indicators - including exports and factory output - which led analysts to forecast a second-quarter contraction when economic growth figures come out on Aug 17. Policymakers see little chance of a return to recession, expecting the economy to stay on track for a moderate growth in the current quarter. Weak data though could raise doubts about the economic outlook in the face of China's slowdown, adding yet more pressure on the Bank of Japan to trim its rosy projections and prompting calls for fresh stimulus to support expansion. Companies surveyed by the Cabinet Office have forecast that core machinery orders, a highly volatile data series seen as an indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, will rise 0.3 percent in July-September. Core orders, which exclude those of ships and electric power utilities, grew 2.9 percent in April-June from the prior three months, which was the fourth straight quarterly gain. The Cabinet Office stuck to its assessment of machinery orders as \"picking up,\" suggesting that the monthly decline may be a one-off. \"June's decline was due to a big drop in manufacturers' orders, which came as reaction to gains in the prior month in sectors such as steel,\" said a Cabinet Office official. Capital spending holds the key to Japan's drive for a virtuous cycle of business investment, household income growth and consumer spending to pull the economy out of nearly two decades of deflation. Recent signs suggest that firms may finally be shaking off their deflationary mindset, in which they long hoarded cash rather than investing profits in plant and equipment and boosting wages. The Bank of Japan's last quarterly tankan business sentiment survey on July 1 showed that big Japanese firms plan to boost capital spending in the fiscal year to next March at the fastest pace in a decade. A Reuters poll also showed last month two in five Japanese firms plan to boost capital spending this business year, with automobile and transport equipment makers, along with property and construction companies, among the more bullish sectors.

        "article": "Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin said Tuesday the Ten Commandments monument at the Capitol will stay there despite the state's Supreme Court ruling it violated the Constitution and must be removed. The Tulsa World reports Fallin and Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt asked the Oklahoma Supreme Court to reconsider the 7-2 decision that was handed down last week after a challenge from the ACLU of Oklahoma on behalf of three plaintiffs. Lawmakers have also filed legislation to let people vote on whether to remove a portion of the state Constitution cited in the ruling; Article II, Section 5. It reads: \"No public money or property shall ever be appropriated, applied, donated, or used, directly or indirectly, for the use, benefit, or support of any sect, church, denomination, or system of religion, or for the use, benefit, or support of any priest, preacher, minister, or other religious teacher or dignitary, or sectarian institution as such.\" The state said last week the Ten Commandments are \"obviously religious in nature and are an integral part of the Jewish and Christian faiths.\" The state Constitution bans using public money or property for the benefit of any religious purpose. The monument was privately funded by Republican Rep. Mike Ritze. \u201cOklahoma is a state where we respect the rule of law, and we will not ignore the state courts or their decisions,\u201d Fallin said. \u201cHowever, we are also a state with three co-equal branches of government.\u201d Fallin cited a petition to rehear the case and legislation seeking to let people vote on amending the constitution in her argument to let the monument stay on Capitol grounds, according to the newspaper. Last week, Pruitt argued the monument was historical in nature and nearly identical to a Texas monument that was found constitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court. The Oklahoma justices said the local monument violated the state's constitution, not the U.S. Constitution. \"Quite simply, the Oklahoma Supreme Court got it wrong,\" Pruitt said in a statement. \"The court completely ignored the profound historical impact of the Ten Commandments on the foundation of Western law.\" Ryan Kiesel, ACLU of Oklahoma executive director said Fallin is charged with enforcing the law, not predicting the \"hypothetical future\" of it. He also told the Tulsa World he wouldn't be surprised if Fallin denies a court order. \u201cFrankly, I would be astonished if we get to a point where the governor outright defies an order of our state\u2019s highest court,\u201d Kiesel said. \u201cThat said, if she does, there is a word for it. It is called contempt.\u201d As a result of the court ruling, some lawmakers have called for the impeachment of the justices who voted for it. Several other religious orders have tried to erect religious monuments on Capitol grounds since the Ten Commandments was placed in 2012. Among them is a group that wants to erect a 7-foot-tall statue that depicts Satan as Baphomet, a goat-headed figure with horns, wings and a long beard. A Hindu leader in Nevada, an animal rights group, and the satirical Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster also have made requests.

        "article": "U.S. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor speaks at the Conservative Political Action Conference in National Harbor, Md., March 15, 2013. After several days of debating how to restore their party\u2019s brand, Republican leaders left a party confab in Los Angeles last week in agreement that they can no longer be \u201cthe party of no.\u201d But they were less clear on what to say \u201cyes\u201d to. \u201cTo win, we need to be the party of solutions,\u201d says Nebraska GOP chairman JL Spray. Now that Republicans have pointed out problems on issues like immigration, student loans, and the budget, he adds: \u201cLet\u2019s start fixing some things.\u201d While GOP officials at the party\u2019s spring meeting in Hollywood had plenty of ideas for changing their public rhetoric, however, positive new policy ideas were in shorter supply. The gathering\u2019s purpose, said RNC officials who recently released a much-publicized autopsy of the 2012 election, was largely to begin reshaping negative perceptions of the GOP. At the meeting, the Republican National Committee\u2019s 168 members sat through upbeat sessions with titles like \u201cHow to say what we mean and show that we care,\u201d and \u201cWinning the Women\u2019s vote.\u201d (MORE: GOP Rank And File Fight Back Against Party Elite In Hollywood) Those sessions were all the more important, Republicans say, because party officials keep making the wrong kinds of headlines. In the past month, Republican officials repudiated Alask Rep. Don Young for using the slur \u201cwetback,\u201d and Michigan national committeeman Dave Agema for posting on Facebook a story that decries \u201cfilthy\u201d homosexuals. \u201cThe lack of relationships in these communities is getting in the way of us talking about the issues,\u201d said one RNC official here this week. Hoping to turn the page, in recent months top GOP lawmakers like House Majority Leader Eric Cantor and Senator Marco Rubio have given major speeches on what the GOP calls its \u201copportunity agenda\u201d \u2014 tackling education reform, college affordability, and endemic poverty. Last week, Senator Rand Paul visited historically black Howard University to contest the image of Republicans as insensitive towards minorities. So far, though, those speeches haven\u2019t turned into legislative priorities. Of late Republicans have mostly debated the impact of the budget sequester and hit President Barack Obama\u2019s annual budget plan as out of balance. And while the party committee devoted two of twelve resolutions approved in Los Angeles to reaffirming \u201ctraditional marriage,\u201d the opportunity planks were absent. \u201cRepublicans have done a better job of not antagonizing voters, but we still have a ways to go in making them want to vote for us,\u201d complained one RNC member. (MORE: Viewpoint: Only Empathy Can Transform the GOP) A statement from the RNC focused on the party\u2019s image woes, which officials believe is a perquisite to putting forward their own policy proposals. \u201cWe have a perception problem and Chairman [Reince] Priebus is committed to highlighting these Republican reforms so more Americans know Republicans are making important headway in states and building a permanent grassroots organization so we can begin developing the relationships needed to make policy and election inroads as a party,\u201d said press secretary Kirsten Kukowski. Some Republicans worry the policy agenda remains too thin, thanks in part to a near-singular focus on debt and deficits over the past two years, and poorly communicated to regular Americans. \u201cWe don\u2019t talk about kitchen table issues,\u201d said former Michigan national committeeman Saul Anuzis, describing the party\u2019s challenge. \u201cWe spend too much time talking about the philosophy of smaller government \u2014 and that\u2019s not what voters care about.\u201d \u201cWe have to make an argument that fiscal responsibility is a part of a plan to help all Americans; rather than talking about spending cuts or balanced budgets because that\u2019s what we \u201cstand\u201d for,\u201d said former Romney policy adviser Lanhee Chen, who will be helping the National Republican Senatorial Committee work with candidates to develop policy agendas in the upcoming 2014 cycle. \u201cThe biggest mistake we\u2019ve made is to sound like the party of austerity for austerity\u2019s sake.\u201d The RNC points to the accomplishments of Republican governors as models for the party at large \u2014 including Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback\u2019s Medicaid reform efforts and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal\u2019s efforts to promote teacher accountability. They also point to former President George W. Bush\u2019s pre-9/11 agenda of compassionate conservatism as a helpful model. Bush was elected in 2000 on a platform featuring education reform, tax cuts and expanded Medicare benefits. (MORE: Consultants in Conservative Crosshairs As GOP Brass Calls For Reforms) Bush, however, offered new goodies to voters at a time of budget surpluses. Today\u2019s Republicans enjoy no such luxury, severely limiting the initiatives they can offer to voters. After his election defeat, Mitt Romney complained that Hispanic voters had rewarded Barack Obama for expensive \u201cgifts\u201d he\u2019d given them in the form of government benefits like Obamacare. Republicans could make a policy mark this year if they strike a bipartisan deal with Democrats on immigration reform. The prominent role of Rubio in the immigration debate could put a clear GOP stamp on any final product. The GOP\u2019s recent autopsy report called a clear policy shift on immigration critical to allowing a dialogue with the nation\u2019s fast-growing Latino population. (Meanwhile, some party operatives \u2014 particularly younger ones \u2014 have urged similar thinking on gay marriage as a means of connecting with liberal young voters, so far to no avail.) Whatever the specific agenda, Republicans say, it has to offer something more than dour austerity. Only reforms that promise to directly help people can put the party on a path to success in 2014 and 2016. That, says, Spray, is all the more true at a time when world events don\u2019t give the GOP an edge: \u201cThat\u2019s the only way we\u2019ve ever won the White House when national security wasn\u2019t on the front burner.\u201d As they departed Los Angeles, many RNC members agreed that the question for the GOP isn\u2019t just how to stop alienating voters. It\u2019s how to start winning them back over. But exactly what they\u2019ll be offering still looks unclear. MORE: Republican Party Says No to Same-Sex Marriage",

        "article": "Whenever Michael Konstalid visits a school, he makes sure to pay a visit to the basement. There, Mr. Konstalid, a roaming physical therapist for the New York City Education Department, gives his phone number to a custodian and asks that no broken furniture be thrown away until he is called. This protocol keeps him in the supplies he uses to build custom physical therapy equipment, out of things that would otherwise end up in the trash. \u201cAlmost everything I build in schools are made from scrap wood, broken desks, broken tables, broken chairs, broken magazine racks, broken unidentified things,\u201d Mr. Konstalid said. \u201cThese are some pretty tired pieces of furniture.\u201d Among his creations have been tiny hurdles made of PVC pipe, intended to help children improve their coordination. He has turned a discarded bookcase into a small set of steps, used to help a little girl get on and off the school bus by herself. He bound together a short length of red, white and blue scrap rope, so a boy with difficulty walking could be tethered to an adult in case he stumbled, but would otherwise travel the halls without leaning on a grown-up for support. He has made several kinds of specialty chairs. \u201cHe reincarnates things,\u201d said Joe Natoli, the building manager at Public School 321 in Park Slope, Brooklyn. After six years of building equipment for his own students, Mr. Konstalid\u2019s stage has expanded. Last fall, he started visiting public schools throughout Brooklyn twice a week as part of his regular schedule, in order to make custom furniture and equipment for students with special needs. Since October, Mr. Konstalid said, he has built or customized more than 70 pieces of furniture at about 35 schools around the borough. \u201cThe team is me, there is a zero-dollar budget, and we\u2019re having this huge impact,\u201d he said. Physical therapy, which is delivered throughout the public school system, is designed to help children with their motor skills, to do things like walk down the hallways, maneuver through the lunchroom, sit in class and generally navigate their environment. Mr. Konstalid, 36, grew up in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, where he learned carpentry (and plumbing and electrical wiring) from his father, who had a workshop in the house. With his blond ponytail and broad shoulders, there is the slight hint of the lumberjack about him. He started out as a physical therapist with the Education Department in 2008, and on Day 1, he said, he realized his extracurricular skills would come in handy in helping a child he was working with who had balancing problems. \u201cI needed a balance beam that was safe,\u201d Mr. Konstalid said. \u201cI needed one, and I needed one yesterday.\u201d So he built it. It was wooden and adjustable, and in its former life, it had been a door. If you look closely, he said, pointing to a picture, you can see the holes where the hinges had been. In a kindergarten classroom at Public School 10 in Brooklyn a few weeks ago, a boy named Hasan Mahmud passed out napkins before snack time. He navigated the room with a somewhat unsteady gait but an eager, dimpled smile, then climbed into a chair Mr. Konstalid had built just for him. It looked much like a standard classroom chair, but with a few adjustments, each made with a similarly shaded blond wood. It had arms, an additional backrest to make the seat shallower, and a footrest so the boy\u2019s legs would not dangle above the floor. Once upon a time it had been a table. \u201cA chair you would purchase would cost several thousand dollars, and would look so fantastic and different from every other chair in the classroom,\u201d Mr. Konstalid said. \u201cThis chair is made custom for him, and it looks as close to a typical classroom chair as possible.\u201d Another kind of chair, made for a girl named India, was a boxy wooden structure, with a back built at just the right height for her to join her classmates when they sat on the floor. India, 6, has trouble with her core strength and needs extra support to stay sitting upright. \u201cI think she\u2019s proud of it,\u201d said her mother, Amyliz, who requested that their last name be withheld to protect her daughter\u2019s privacy. \u201cYou start to worry as they get older that they\u2019re aware there\u2019s something different. But this chair is more like a throne. It feels kind of special for her.\u201d If there is a demonstrated need, the Education Department is responsible for buying physical therapy equipment for students. Both Mr. Konstalid and Laura Scott, the principal of P.S. 10, where he works two days a week, say that while they have had no trouble getting what they need through official channels, what Mr. Konstalid offers is different. He works fast, and the turnaround time is generally just a couple of days, or even a few hours; the equipment he makes is free; and it is made specifically for the very child sitting in front of him. (Adaptive Design, a nonprofit group, also builds custom furniture to meet the special needs of specific children, though it generally builds out of heavy-duty cardboard.) In the hope of getting their children the best equipment available as quickly as possible, parents who can afford to sometimes go outside the system and spend hundreds of dollars of their own buying equipment they think might help, rather than wading through Education Department procedures. Rebecca, a parent at P.S. 321 who also requested that their last name be withheld to protect her daughter\u2019s privacy, bought four different sets of chairs for her daughter, Jacqueline, 10, who has a motor neuron disease that made it difficult for her to join her classmates on the rug. For a variety of reasons, none of them really helped. When Jacqueline got to second grade, Mr. Konstalid made her a chair out of the back and seat of an old plastic shell chair, fixed firmly to a wooden base. Jacqueline was able to join her classmates on the rug, and get in and out of the chair by herself. Then he made several more for her classmates, so Jacqueline would not feel singled out. \u201cHe built a chair that was the only chair that ever worked for Jacqueline,\u201d her mother said. \u201cNobody had ever tried to build a chair for her before. I\u2019m not handy, and my husband\u2019s not handy \u2014 we have other skills!\u201d she said, laughing. \u201cHe gets that these small changes are huge for kids in their environment, and it really doesn\u2019t have to be complicated,\u201d she said. Her only criticism of Mr. Konstalid is that \u201cthere\u2019s only one of him,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m hoping there be will be 30 of him at some point.\u201d A version of this article appears in print on April 15, 2015, on page A20 of the New York edition with the headline: For Special-Needs Students, Custom Furniture Out of Schoolhouse Scraps.

        "article": "TODAY is Valentine's Day, and I know that the occasion calls for intimate dining with my loved one at some cozy North Shore gourmet hideaway or at one of the more ebulliently romantic establishments to the south. I mentioned this to my loved one the other day, but she, having been sharing bed and board with me for several decades, was not swept off her feet by this invitation to a one-night affair away from home. ''You have no time for all of that,'' she said. ''Better to get romantic, whatever that is, in June, which rhymes with moon. February only rhymes with 'are you really,' and I'm tired of thinking of all the things that have to be done now.'' The loved one may be no Ogden Nash when it comes to versifying, but she is certainly on the mark about the situation that comes about just around this time. A Valentine's Day card is, for me, just another form that must be filed against deadline. The threat of penalty for not sending a Valentine's Day card is merely implicit in the emotions, whereas the penalty threats for failing to send out other pieces of paper is spelled out explicitly by law and regulation. First of all, the loved one, whom I adore for her practicality (see Sub-Section No. 8, Article 2 for additional claims), has been working on the income tax and won't have time to send me a card. She understands taxes, and all she wants from me is my name signed in the proper places. As a complete dunderhead in these matters, I gather from the effort going into preparing our return that we are in a category that should have us socializing with Rothschilds and Rockefellers. But, while Rothschilds and Rockefellers may be socializing on north, south or whatever shore strikes their fancy and pocket, we are not socializing at all. We are home filling out forms. Evenings in the house are a picture of homey warmth as the loved one deals with the Federal and other governments and I handle the medical plan compensation. The latter has become the hobby of my declining years, and I have built up an ardent correspondence with my pen pals at Blue Cross, G.H.I. and Major Medical Insurance. The sums are not astronomical, but they are sufficient to warrant buying the new, higher-priced postage stamps. But it took me a long time not to take the various denials of payment as personal rejections devoid of love. You see, it's a game that must be played out; file the claim, get the rejection, send that all to the next insurer, get part of the claim and do not get part and send that on to the next insurer. There are times when you return to go. It used to be impossible for me to tell in whose court the claim was at any given moment, but I've set up a system at home that reveals all instantly. However, as things come and go, they must be entered and updated and followed. I think that, although it has cut down on s uch time-wasters as reading, model-making and television, it is a s disciplined a hobby asfiling for taxes. Indeed, the sight of the tw o of us immersed in paperwork is a vision of utter domesticity, h usband and wife together, absorbed in a latter-day version of simple home crafting such as bound families together in the Hebrid es. St. Valentine, has ever before such a romantic image been evoked ? Oh, that' s not the whole story. The automobile insurance falls due sometime abou t now, and the loved one has just received the papers torenew her dri ver's license. It's really quite convenient, the renewalprocess, but the hard part is the hunt for the renewal stub of the old license. It was conscienciously filed away several years ago, butwhere? Under automobile, family documents, passports and other odd classificatio ns in our cabinet? Finally it showed up under ''automobile insurance.'' St. Valentine, keep the love light burning in my loved one's eyes - she already has the requisite approval, on paper, from the eye doctor to stay on the road - so that she will continue to pick me up after a commute home. Man and woman do not love by bed alone. You must not think for a moment that we are stuck with form filling. Whenever a slack sets in, there is always a recess for clipping out the coupons that allow you to buy those astounding discounts at the store. Having clipped, we slip out to the supermarket in pursuit of those great bargains. As often as not, we are too late and encounter shelves bare of the loss leaders. At times, in my absentmindedness, I load the booty into the shopping cart only to learn at the checkout that I have forgotten to bring the coupons along. That is inconvenient; I shudder to think how things would be if we needed food stamps. Valentine's Day, remember that food for the physique ranks with food for the spirit in pursuit of true love. Valentine was assuredly a saint whose heart was in the right place, but at these times he has turned into a card, and that is what I am incomparably suited to handling; merely address and sign and wait for the reply. If you have the time to go somewhere for romantic atmosphere on this day, by all means rush out. But don't forget the credit card and don't forget to pocket the receipt; it will show up soon on a form somewhere. Happy Valentine's Day!",

The industry exceeded 9 million barrels in November, and production has been about 9.3 million barrels a day recently. While U.S. production remains high, Saudi Arabian output has increased to 10.3 million barrels, and Russian output reportedly has remained steady, a bearish formula for prices.

Gheit said low prices are an advantage for some companies and a hardship for others. For instance, a cash-rich major like Exxon Mobil could be well placed to do a major acquisition in a low price environment. Royal Dutch Shell and BG Group, the two biggest producers of liquefied natural gas, announced this month that they are hooking up in a near-$70 billion deal in a weak LNG pricing environment. More deals are expected in the oil sector. \"The longer oil prices remain low, the more likely more and more companies will throw in the towel. The reason we haven't seen a lot of mergers and acquisitions is, the potential seller is eyeing $100 oil, and the potential buyer is thinking oil prices could get stuck at $50,\" Gheit said. Gheit said oil will probably settle in the $70-a-barrel range, and the U.S. unconventional industry will emerge from the collapse in prices as a changed industry.

Brad stresses these economists\u2019 ignorance of intellectual tradition. But they were and still are amazingly ignorant of what contemporary economists who don\u2019t happen to be part of their hermetic world have been doing. In my world \u2014 and by this I mean my narrowly professional world as a research economist \u2014 the big development of the 1990s was the updating of Mundell-Fleming by Maury Obstfeld and Ken Rogoff. Mundell-Fleming is the classic application of IS-LM models to open economies; Obstfeld-Rogoff redid it in terms of New Keynesian modeling, which itself was created during the 1980s by Akerlof, Yellen, Mankiw, Blanchard, Kiyotaki, and others. Over time, the O-R work gave rise to a whole genre of New Open Economy Macroeconomics. When I started working on the liquidity trap, Obstfeld-Rogoff was in the back of my mind, although I was always looking for ways to make the models (much) simpler, among other things by pushing the open-economy side of things to the background. To be clear, I don\u2019t actually believe in all the intertemporal maximization that goes on in these models; but I find it very useful nonetheless to see whether my intuitions can be borne out within that kind of framework, if only to be sure that the argument is internally consistent. And one of the things O-R considered, right from the get-go, was fiscal policy. In the linked 1994 paper they showed, among other things, that a temporary fiscal expansion \u201cworks\u201d even with Ricardian equivalence; and that when there are unemployed resources, the expansion of government spending need not come at the expense of private spending, but instead comes from putting additional resources to work. And so I was somewhat stunned when, as the fiscal debate unfolded, we had all these Chicago types sneeringly asserting that \u201cnobody\u201d, except possibly people at \u201cthird-tier\u201d departments, has believed for decades that fiscal expansion can actually expand demand; Obstfeld and Rogoff are pretty prominent nobodies. I was equally stunned by assertions that Ricardian equivalence would wipe out any expansionary effect from fiscal policy, and that government spending necessarily crowds out an equal amount of private spending, when influential modern papers have shown quite clearly, and as rigorously as anyone could want, that it just ain\u2019t so. But in retrospect, it\u2019s quite clear: Lucas and Sargent declared final victory over all things Keynesian in the 1970s, and the closed minds of their followers were such that they didn\u2019t even notice the revival of Keynesianism that took place over the three decades that followed. And Brad is right: if you\u2019ve reached the point where you don\u2019t pay attention to anything that might disturb your orthodoxy, you\u2019re not doing science, you\u2019re not even pursuing a discipline. All you\u2019re doing is perpetuating a smug, closed-minded sect.",

RELATED: PAT SAJAK 'FEELS TERRIBLE' ABOUT 'FAST AND THE FURIOUS' PUZZLE ON 'WHEEL OF FORTUNE' Emil de Leon only had the vague hint that he was guessing a \"thing\" that started with \"NE.\" The board looked like this: NE_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ \"This looks tough to me. It's a thing,\" Sajak told him. \"You're a really good problem solver but I don't know. You have 10 seconds. Keep talking, maybe the right thing will pop out. Good luck.\" RELATED: PAT SAJAK ADMITS BEING DRUNK ON \u2018WHEEL\u2019 De Leon correctly guessed \"New baby buggy\" with his first attempt \u2014 prompting Pat to playfully pat-down the player. Vanna White, the studio audience and viewers at home could hardly believe his luck \u2014 and de Leon walked away with $45,000. RELATED: PAT SAJAK: KEITH OLBERMANN IS MY FAULT! \"Tonight's 'Wheel of Fortune' features most amazing solve in my 30+ years on the show. No kidding,\" Sajak tweeted. But was everyone mistaking exceptional verbal ability for a bolt of lightning? RELATED: NYC WOMAN NAILS 'WHEEL OF FORTUNE' ANSWER WITH JUST ONE LETTER Some linguistically minded folks think that attributing de Leon's win to near-divine luck takes away from the contestant's quick thinking. After all, with N and E on the board, the first word almost certainly had to be \"New.\" RELATED: 'WHEEL OF FORTUNE'S' CHARLIE O'DONNELL DIES As for the other words, cultural blogger Caitlin Dewey of The Washington Post points out that the show's contestants get to see a used letter board and that de Leon's would have read, \"ABC FG IJK PQ UVWXYZ\" because he already guessed H, M, D and O. And since Q, J, Z, X, V, K and W are essentially useless and appear in less than 1.5 percent of English words, de Leon needed to put together two words of four and five letters using A, B, C, F, G, I, P, U and Y. Dewey said de Leon could only have 53 possible five-letter words and that most of them \u2014 like fizzy or puffy \u2014 are not things. In short, there weren't exactly many other valid guesses he could have stumbled upon. So the question remains whether the \"Wheel of Fortune\" guess heard around the world was an instance of unbelievable luck, or of a man who truly knows how to play the game. On a mobile device? Watch the video here. Words can't explain how I feel right now. Thanks to everyone who watched @WheelofFortune tonight! It was a huge and unforgettable journey!",

        "article": "Towering presence . . . the revamped Royal Shakespeare theatre. Photograph: David Sillitoe for the Guardian When the renovation of the Royal Shakespeare theatre at Stratford-upon-Avon was first announced, someone asked why the number of seats was to fall by 400. Surely this was against the notion of \"accessibility\" or \"art for all\"? Michael Boyd, artistic director of the RSC, boomed: \"This isn't football \u2013 you're meant to be able to hear what the actors are saying.\" The sheer scale of the old theatre had long been a problem. So great was the distance between the proscenium stage and the back row that even the stormiest Lear was all but inaudible to those seats. \"It might be apocryphal,\" says Rab Bennetts of Bennetts Associates, the architects behind the newly unveiled \u00a3112m revamp, \"but one actor claimed that reciting from the old stage was like addressing Calais from the white cliffs of Dover.\" Although the adjoining Swan theatre has also been given a spruce-up, the most fundamental change to this much respected, if not always loved, theatre complex on the banks of the Avon has been to the main theatre: the 1,400-seat art deco auditorium, designed by Elisabeth Scott in 1927, has been demolished, and replaced with what is intended to be a stage in the style of Shakespeare's day, but brought up to date. So brick and concrete co-exist, as well as timbers that are both ancient and freshly sawn. There's also a thrust stage jutting into the audience. Actors on the new stage are now about 15 metres, rather than 27, from the back row, so it's goodbye to that declamatory performing style. \"Although it was listed,\" says Bennetts, \"the old theatre was strangely remote and uninviting. It turned its back on the town, showing a tough brick face to the streets. Locals called Scott's building the Jam Factory, and, despite its distinguished art deco lobbies and rooms, it did have the look of an industrial building of the 1930s.\" The complex has a complicated history. Called the Shakespeare Memorial theatre when it opened in 1879, it was a flamboyant piece of Victorian gothic until fire struck in 1926. Scott's art deco theatre was built into those parts that survived. For more than two decades now, the complex has also been home to the much-feted 450-seat Swan theatre, created within fire-damaged walls. Used for productions of Shakespeare's more intimate plays, and those of his contemporaries, the Swan has been the model for the reconstructed Royal Shakespeare theatre. The RSC had planned to demolish the whole caboodle and build afresh. But in 2003, times, finances, aspirations and artistic and architectural direction changed as Boyd took over. A more \"as you find it\" experience was chosen: a pair of Shakespearean theatres linked together with a weave of empathetic new architecture, creating a convincing and effective whole. More than this, the old theatres would be made to address the town, and open themselves up to the public whether they were coming to sit through King Lear or not. The Scott building has been stripped of all later accretions and given a new public entrance that stretches into a broad, bricked arcade linking it with the older building. A new restaurant now tops the Scott section, which boasts a 36-metre lift and viewing tower, faced in handmade brick. This urban eyecatcher acts, Bennetts says, as \"an anchor, mooring a fleet of theatrical buildings\". It also serves as a giant mast or flagpole, proudly drawing attention to the RSC's home. Views from the top, through glass louvres, are of four counties and every local site associated with Shakespeare himself. The new entrance, by the base of the tower, leads visitors and theatregoers into Bennetts's arcade and into the original art deco entrance lobby, now an airy bar. These spaces flow seamlessly into a second lobby. Here you walk on teak planks taken from the old stage, meaning you tread the very boards that Olivier trod years ago. The Royal Shakespeare theatre itself \u2013 the heart of the project \u2013 feels impressive and likable. Three tiers of upholstered red seats surround the thrust stage. The feeling is both grand and intimate, exciting and stark, what with those riveted steel joists and unpolished timber. Sound and sensation are all. We will, though, have to wait until next spring, when plays are first performed in here, to judge it properly. Backstage is enormous, with smart dressing rooms overlooking the Avon, their balconies softening that hard brick exterior. In fact, the complex, especially its tower, has the picturesque quality of some half-imagined Italian town, where the action of some Shakespeare play might take place: two theatres of Verona, if you like. The grouping of the buildings works well; that arcade has power and charm. The complex feels like a town in itself, one that now reaches out to its surroundings. Bennetts and his team have done well to bring so many styles \u2013 gothic, art deco, Modern \u2013 into a cohesive whole, especially one with riveted steel, rusted steel and steel as smooth as lacquered wood. Great things deserve to happen here, and great Shakespearean speeches given. And now you'll even be able to hear them from the cheap seats.",

        "article": "Updated Aug. 2, 2014 7:48 p.m. ET ATLANTA\u2014The first of two Americans infected with Ebola in Liberia arrived here Saturday to receive treatment for the deadly illness. Dr. Kent Brantly was flown on a chartered jet specially equipped with a containment area for patients with infectious diseases that landed before noon at Dobbins Air Reserve base, northwest of the city. He was then put in a white ambulance with red and blue markings, along with a police escort, and taken to Emory University Hospital, about 14 miles away. Dr. Brantly, who was infected while working at an Ebola treatment center operated by two U.S. faith-based organizations, walked into Emory on his own accord, said Todd Shearer, a spokesman for Samaritan's Purse, one of the charities running the clinic. Mr. Shearer said he did not know the medical condition of the 33-year-old doctor from Texas. An Emory spokesman would not comment on the patient's status. Another charity worker at the center, Nancy Writebol, who had been helping decontaminate workers, also has been infected and is expected to arrive at Emory for treatment in coming days. Bruce Ribner, an infectious-diseases doctor and head of a special isolation unit at Emory University Hospital, said Friday there were good reasons to airlift the two to Emory. \"We can deliver a substantially higher level of care, a substantially higher level of support, to optimize the likelihood that those patients will survive this episode,\" he said. Dr. Ribner added that he was \"cautiously optimistic\" the two have a good chance of recovery once they reach Emory, and that the transfer would be safe. Emory University Hospital houses a specially built isolation unit equipped to treat patients exposed to deadly infectious diseases. The 12-year-old clinic previously treated a patient with SARS, which swept through multiple countries in 2003. The unit is separate from other patient areas, and its staff is highly trained. Dr. Brantly and Ms. Writebol are among more than 1,323 people who have been infected with Ebola since February in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. The escalating outbreak has underscored the challenges of quelling a deadly disease in countries with poor health infrastructure, suspicions of Western medicine and burial rites in which families handle the still-contagious corpses of their loved ones, promoting the disease's spread. Of the infected, 729 have died. Though the arrival of two Ebola patients to an American city had many people concerned, U.S. officials said the risk of spread in the U.S, is low. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control, based just down the road from Emory University Hospital, will be regularly consulting with Emory. The CDC has warned doctors in the U.S. to be on the lookout for Ebola symptoms in people who have traveled recently to West Africa. Ebola, whose symptoms can begin with fever and nausea and progress to internal bleeding, has been known to kill up to 90% of those it infects. It spreads through contact with bodily fluids. There is no vaccine or cure. Patients aren't infectious until they are sick\u2014and even when they begin to develop symptoms, they aren't highly infectious, experts say. The most contagious patients are those who are very sick and unlikely to be moving around much, they say. Write to Cameron McWhirter at cameron.mcwhirter@wsj.com",

        "article": "Americans\u2019 addiction to social media is deepening, according to a new report that found that while Facebook devotion has plateaued, other social networking platforms are gaining in popularity. In an analysis of social media use, the Pew Research Center reported Wednesday that messaging apps and new social networks are gaining popularity most quickly among American adults. The Pew report found that 29 percent of American adults use messaging apps such as iMessage, Kik or WhatsApp. That trend held up across all ages of adults. Those between 18 and 29 years old were the heaviest messaging app users, with nearly half using messaging apps. But even among older users, these types of services have taken hold; nearly a quarter of adults 50 and older also use messaging apps. \u201cThe emergence of messaging apps is noteworthy, as these communication tools serve different social needs than traditional online social networks,\u201d Maeve Duggan, a research associate at the Pew Research Center, said in a statement. \u201cThe data also show how swiftly an already complex terrain of interaction is becoming more varied.\u201d Newer social networking platforms achieved the most growth \u2014 namely Instagram and Pinterest, which have doubled their user bases since 2012, the study said. More established sites recorded less growth. Facebook, for example, is still the most popular social media site in the United States. But its growth over the past year has been fairly flat, the study showed. Still, the site retains a commanding lead over other social media networks, and 72 percent of all American adults online have a Facebook account. (This spring, Pew reported that 71 percent of teens have accounts.) Slowing user growth on older social media sites in the United States is a well-known phenomenon, at least for anyone who has been listening to the earnings calls of these companies over the past several years. In terms of user growth, some of these networks \u2014 such as Facebook \u2014 may be approaching their ceiling. That explains why so many sites are focusing on overseas growth, as well as on developing new services that keep users on their pages longer. Yet, while Facebook may not be gaining users as quickly, it\u2019s still being used. The study said that the percentage of adults who check Facebook daily is holding steady at 70 percent; 62 percent check it more than once a day. Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, also ranked high in user engagement, with Pew reporting that 59 percent of adults said they check it at least once a day. Only 38 percent of Twitter users said they check the site daily. The survey is based on telephone interviews \u2014 on landlines and cellphones \u2014 conducted in March and April with 1,907 adults across the country.

        "article": "Updated NOV 11, 2014 11:07p ET Only the last set of selection committee rankings matter, but man did the group make some interesting statements Tuesday both with its latest poll and some of chairman Jeff Long\u2019s comments explaining its rationale. Here are my three takeaways from the latest playoff rankings. COMMITTEE SENDS MESSAGE BY ELEVATING OREGON First and foremost, 9-1 Oregon checked in at No. 2 this week, ahead of undefeated, defending national champion Florida State. If the season ended today, the only impact that would have is on which team wears the home or road jerseys in their semifinal game. But in the bigger picture, the committee sent its most definitive message to date that this is not the traditional AP and coaches polls. \u201cCommittee looks beyond win-loss record and examines other factors that reflect a team's play. As it should be,\u201d CFP executive director Bill Hancock tweeted shortly after the unveiling. Both on television and in a teleconference afterward, Long said the vote between the two was extremely close but that ultimately Oregon\u2019s trio of top-25 wins (No. 12 Michigan State, No. 11 UCLA and No. 23 Utah), with the latter two coming on the road, gave it the edge over FSU, with its pair of home wins against No. 18 Notre Dame and No. 19 Clemson. \u201cBased on the committee's view about the strength of Florida State's schedule and their body of work compared to Oregon's strength of schedule and body of work, the committee voted that Oregon was No. 2,\u201d said Long. \u201cIt was a very close call, but the committee placed significant value on Oregon's quality of wins against three top\u201125 teams, two of which were on the road.\u201c Asked how the committee counterbalanced Oregon\u2019s stronger set of wins with the fact that, unlike Florida State, it lost a game, at home to Arizona, Long noted the quality of the opponent (the Wildcats rose to No. 14 this week) and, as he\u2019s done previously, alluded to the Ducks\u2019 offensive line injuries that night. You have to be pretty good to remain undefeated this late in the season, as FSU is, but it\u2019s no secret the \u2018Noles have been far from dominant and, in fact, fortunate to escape against Clemson and Notre Dame, so I have no problem with the committee elevating the Ducks. It means they\u2019re paying attention. WHY TCU WAS HIGHER THAN ALABAMA The committee also pulled a mild surprise in bumping TCU, not Alabama, up to No. 4. The two teams were in reverse order last week before the Frogs stomped a then-top-10 Kansas State team at home and the Tide survived then-16th-ranked LSU in overtime on the road. Again, the actual discrepancy doesn\u2019t matter because Alabama can play its way into the top four this week when it hosts No. 1 Mississippi State, but it was interesting to hear Long\u2019s explanation. \u201cI think these are very, very close teams, and that win and the way they won in comparison is what gave TCU an extremely slight edge over Alabama,\u201d said Long. That seems a bit contradictory. On one hand, the committee bestowed praise on Oregon for winning on the road but then in this case seemed to downplay just how hard it is to win at LSU, regardless of margin. That being said, I\u2019ve had TCU higher than Alabama on my FOX Four ballot for weeks -- it has a better r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to this point -- so perhaps it\u2019s just righting a wrong. Finally, it\u2019s clear that TCU-Baylor is shaping up to be this year\u2019s headache-inducing controversy if both continue to win. The Bears closed the gap this week on the Horned Frogs team they beat 61-58 on Oct. 11 but still trail by three spots. The majority of questions on Long\u2019s teleconference Tuesday night dealt with the head-to-head debate. \u201cHead-to-head comes into play when all other things are equal,\u201d said Long. \u201cBut at this point, three consecutive weeks now we\u2019ve said their body of work, strength of schedule, is not the same.\u201d Asked what he\u2019d tell Baylor fans, Long said: \u201cWe're not at the end of the season, so at this point in time, I'd tell them to continue to build their r\u00e9sum\u00e9 with their remaining games left and make their case by their body of work and r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\u201d All along I\u2019ve said that one of the dangers of doing these in-season rankings is that teams\u2019 schedules aren\u2019t necessarily aligned. TCU has already played all of the Big 12\u2019s top teams. Baylor still has Kansas State waiting on Dec. 6. By season\u2019s end, they will have essentially played 11 of the same 12 teams (nine Big 12 games, SMU and an FCS school each), at which point they may well be similar enough that head-to-head becomes a tiebreaker. Which means TCU, despite sitting at No. 4 right now, is no guarantee to finish there even if it wins its remaining games. Of course, the one game that differs between them is that in non-conference play, TCU took on Minnesota while Baylor visited Buffalo. The Gophers, now 7-2, cracked the committee\u2019s top 25 this week. Ohio State, which rose to No. 8 this week and also needs to beef up its r\u00e9sum\u00e9, plays Minnesota this week as well. In this strange new world, Minnesota\u2019s performance down the stretch may play a significant role in shaping the College Football Playoff field.

        "article": "The old, pre-bankruptcy General Motors GM wouldn\u2019t have gotten its shorts in a knot over economic turmoil in Russia. The old GM would have absorbed its losses and taken a patient, long view of Vladimir Putin, falling oil prices and Ukranian tensions. The new, reorganized GM is taking a much shorter view. That\u2019s why it\u2019s closing its massive St. Petersburg assembly plant and taking a $600 million write-off. GM is the first western automaker to call it quits in Russia, though it may not be the last. In the meantime, the Renault Nissan Alliance\u2014the market leader\u2014likely will benefit by grabbing at least a chunk of GM\u2019s 9 percent market share. The Detroit-based automaker that has lost at least $18 billion in Europe since the beginning of the century remains under close scrutiny by investors. Four hedge funds last month demanded a share buyback and a seat on the board. A truce between GM and the funds means the automaker will reduce its cash hoard by roughly $5 billion over the next two years and raise its dividend. Cutting back on its \u201cfortress balance sheet\u201d wasn\u2019t in GM\u2019s plan\u2014but investors such as Appaloosa\u2019s David Tepper are insisting that capital be deployed profitably, or returned. Russia is a place that probably won\u2019t produce returns for some time. \u201cThis decision avoids significant investment into a market that has very challenging long-term prospects,\u201d said G.M.\u2019s president, Daniel Ammann, in a statement. GM doesn\u2019t have a parts and components infrastructure in Russia. To build vehicles it must import from European suppliers, paying in rubles. Since the ruble has lost half its value, GM\u2019s outlay has skyrocketed while overall demand for vehicles has dropped 40 percent\u2014a recipe for financial disaster. Carlos Ghosn, chief executive of the Renault Nissan Alliance, has been telling everyone who asks that his is a long-term view of Russia and that his company is staying. The difference is that Renault and Nissan have performed well for shareholders. (Nissan this month suspended production in Russia for 16 days, while Volkswagen said it will cut work shifts and lay off 150 workers to reduce production.) What Ghosn and GM understand is that the Russian middle class will continue to grow, subject to intermittent economic and political turmoil. Like consumers all over the world, Russians want cell phones, cars, fashion and vacations abroad. As of 2014, Russia stood 57th in the world in terms of private cars\u2014only 300 per 1,000 people, which is even less than countries like Croatia, Estonia and Hungary. (At last count the U.S. had 809 vehicles per 1,000 people.) GM will continue to import Corvettes and big SUVs such as the Chevrolet Tahoe, which should sell in relatively small numbers to oligarchs and other wealthy Russians. When the country settles down, GM can reassess. Perhaps it will return to local manufacturing. Until then, the automaker has much a bigger issue before it, one that\u2019s existential: namely to prove with financial results that it deserved being saved by U.S. taxpayers.

        "article": "NEW YORK U.S. presidential hopeful Donald Trump on Saturday presented his vice presidential running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, as the man who can unify a fractured Republican party and help him bridge the gap created by the candidate's outsider status. In a wide-ranging speech in which he touted his own \"landslide\" victory in the Republican primaries, Trump cast Pence as a perfect complement for the White House: a veteran of government, a man with a Midwestern sensibility and strong Republican credentials as a job creator and budget balancer. \"Indiana Governor Mike Pence was my first choice, I've admired the work he's done, especially in the state of Indiana,\" Trump said at an event in New York City. \"And one of the reasons is party unity, so many people have said, party unity. Because I'm an outsider,\" he added in explaining his decision. Trump and Pence made their debut just two days before the beginning of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, where delegates from around the country will convene to officially nominate the pair as their party's ticket for the Nov. 8 election. Frequently straying from the notes on the lectern, Trump talked about himself and likely Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, often detouring from the purpose of the event: to introduce a little-known politician to the broader public. \"Back to Mike Pence,\" Trump said, interrupting himself during a lengthy explanation about why evangelical voters support his candidacy. He then read a series of statistics highlighting the job growth in Indiana. \"He looks very good,\" added the New York real estate mogul, who is known to comment openly on people's appearances. Trump had a bit of a winding path to settle on Pence, a devout Christian and conservative. He postponed his planned Friday announcement after the deadly attack in Nice, France and saying he had not made his \"final, final decision,\" Trump privately had second thoughts on who to pick in late-night conversations on Thursday, said a Republican source familiar with the situation. Trump had been annoyed that the element of surprise had been taken away by the leaking of Pence's name, the source added. Trump ended up announcing Pence as his running mate on Twitter on Friday. Saturday's event in a New York City hotel ballroom had few of the traditional hallmarks of what is arguably one of the most important decisions for a presidential candidate. Before it started, supporters listened to the Rolling Stones song \"You Can't Always Get What You Want,\" a tune in regular rotation at Trump events. There were no \"Trump Pence\" signs distributed to the crowd or adorning the room. The two appeared together on stage only briefly - each standing out of view while the other one spoke. On stage, they made scant eye contact and shook hands rather than raising arms together in the classic pose of running mates. Neither offered anecdotal stories about their private time together. Pence, in sharp contrast to Trump, delivered a prepared speech, discussing the love of his wife and country and his adoration for Ronald Reagan. He gave a full-throated call to fellow Republicans to back Trump. \"Lets come together as a party, as a people, as a movement, to make America great again and that day begins when Donald Trump becomes the 45th president of the United States of America,\" Pence said. Trump has struggled to bridge the gap between himself and the establishment and conservative wings of the party. The drastically different styles highlighted Pence's ability to provide a complementing tone to the presidential ticket. It's unclear when the two will appear together again. Pence heads back to Indiana for a solo event on Saturday night, and the Trump campaign hasn't released a schedule for the convention that would include a joint appearance. The pair recorded an interview with CBS's \"60 Minutes\" that is scheduled to air on Sunday night. One of their big challenges will be to brook their policy differences in public. Pence gave a nod to that by saying \"strong Republican leadership can bring about real change.\" Trump has made renegotiating trade deals a central theme of his campaign, while Pence has spoken in favor of trade agreements. In an appearance on Friday night on Fox News, Pence offered a moderated take on trade, saying he agrees with Trump that deals should be renegotiated. He also softened his vocal opposition to Trump's call to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States. \"I am very supportive of Donald Trump's call to temporarily suspend immigration from countries where terrorist influence and impact represents a threat to the United States,\" Pence told conservative Fox News commentator Sean Hannity. Pence added that he supports Trump's call for building a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico.

        "article": "Then there was a roar, and 20 motorcycles appeared, two at a time, to escort the body of the fallen officer through the streets of Newark where he had spent, and then given, his life. In thick rows of blue and gray, officers quietly saluted as the bagpipes wailed, and the pallbearers carried the flag-draped coffin up three steps, then four, then three more, and into the grand Cathedral Basilica of the Sacred Heart, where about 1,600 people, including Gov. Jon S. Corzine and Mayor Cory A. Booker, gathered to pay their respects. Hundreds more officers watched from the auditorium of Barringer High School next door, which Sergeant Popolizio had attended. \u201cWe all do the same work,\u201d said John Phipps, an officer from Nassau County, who sat with his hat off and his head bowed as the service unfolded on a big screen. \u201cThe danger is always there. I wanted to let the other departments know that they\u2019re not here by themselves.\u201d Sergeant Popolizio was killed on Saturday as he chased William Danlo Rodriguez through the streets of the East Ward. Mr. Rodriguez is accused of stealing a patrol car in circumstances that are still under investigation. During the chase, the sport utility vehicle Sergeant Popolizio was driving flipped, and the police said that Mr. Rodriguez might have rammed the sergeant\u2019s car. Now Sergeant Popolizio\u2019s family sat in the first rows of pews: his widow and the mother of their four children, Nereida; his father, Nicola; and his brother, Pasquale. Another brother, Officer Nicola B. Popolizio, died after suffering a heart attack in December at age 38. During the service, a police officer brought the family a box of tissues and a jug of water. A young girl played in the aisle, and another child found a shoulder to nap on. Pasquale Popolizio rested a white-gloved hand on his father\u2019s back. Across the aisle, Governor Corzine sat with Mayor Booker and Mr. McCarthy. Since 2003, three Newark officers have been killed in the line of duty. Sergeant Popolizio was the first officer to be killed since Mr. Booker took office, and the mayor spoke passionately of him. \u201cHe was, in the proudest provincial sense, a true Newarker,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was a scion of these streets.\u201d Then Mr. McCarthy took his turn, at times letting his anger flare. \u201cEvents as tragic as these are never singular events,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re very quick to try and assess blame. To try and figure out why. To point fingers.\u201d Early Saturday, Mr. Rodriguez was arrested during a police crackdown on drag races when he tossed a gun out of a car window as officers approached, the police said. Handcuffed but apparently left unguarded, he managed to steal the patrol car, the police said, leading to the chase. He has pleaded not guilty to charges including aggravated manslaughter. Friends say Sergeant Popolizio went by the nickname \u201cPop\u201d or \u201cPoppo.\u201d He liked paintball, and played third base in softball. He called his friend Tommy Easterling \u201cCaptain Caveman,\u201d because of his big feet. He helped with the Christmas toy drive. He worked out of several different precincts, and in gang and narcotics units. The work took a mental toll, Officer Easterling said, and his friend was fond of talking about the vacations he dreamed of. When the service had ended, and the pipers had finished playing \u201cThe Minstrel Boy,\u201d Mayor Booker stood outside the cathedral, megaphone in hand, and addressed his police officers again: \u201cWe have lost one of our own. God as my witness, we cannot lose another.\u201d The motorcycles led the way to Holy Cross Cemetery in North Arlington, followed by more than 150 other vehicles. At the gravesite, Sergeant Popolizio\u2019s colleagues saluted him one more time, and his family tossed roses on his coffin. Vanessa Rosenberg was at the service with her husband, Ian Rosenberg, a New Jersey state trooper. \u201cAnyone has to cry when you hear the bagpipes,\u201d Ms. Rosenberg said. And the show of support for the sergeant\u2019s family moved her to say: \u201cIt is a little bit comforting to know that they\u2019ll be there for me if it\u2019s my turn. I mean, I pray it won\u2019t be.\u201d Because of an editing error, a picture yesterday with an article about the funeral of Sgt. Tommaso Popolizio of the Newark Police Department, who died on Saturday in a car chase, carried an erroneous credit. The photograph of police officers mourning was by Todd Heisler of The New York Times, not by Richard Perry of The Times.

        "article": "ABSINTHE? So devil may care, so deliciously disreputable, so ... louche. But it\u2019s poisonous, no? It eats your brain and drives you crazy! If nothing else, a century of prohibition on absinthe gave it the sort of aura of dissolute glamour that would-be brooding artists would drown their agents for. The two faces of absinthe offered possibilities to idealists the world over, searching for a muse or testing the limits of their risk-taking. Consider the cast of mythological absinthe drinkers: the vulnerable painter and poet, too sensitive for this mean old world; the tormented soul, unable to snap out of his self-loathing; the rakish hedonist, seeking one big, lurid rush; the wealthy dilettante, dipping a toe in bohemia; and of course, all manner of willing women. But now absinthe is legal again, and the romance of belle \u00e9poque naughtiness must give way to what\u2019s in the glass. Pull over, you disillusioned dreamers: with no laws to break, no frissons of danger, let the mystification stop right now. Since absinthe was legalized in the United States in 2007, it has gone from forbidden fruit to virulent weed. Once smuggled from Eastern Europe or procured from back-alley producers, absinthe is now just another bottle on the bar. Yet mystique continues as marketing. To give absinthe its moment in the harsh light of day, the tasting panel sampled 20 bottles. Florence Fabricant and I were joined by Audrey Saunders, an owner of the Pegu Club on West Houston Street, and Pete Wells, editor of the Dining section, who writes about drinks. So what makes absinthe absinthe? Essentially it is a neutral spirit infused with myriad herbs and botanicals, centering around anise, fennel and a specific type of wormwood, Artemisia absinthium, from which absinthe takes its name. This wormwood contains small amounts of thujone, a compound once thought to affect the mind. It\u2019s understood now that hallucinations and other health issues attributed to overindulging in absinthe were more a result of alcohol poisoning due to the high alcohol content, typically 50 to 70 percent. Few things demystify absinthe more than the daunting prospect of 20 glasses in front of you. For instance, all those nicknames \u2014 the green fairy, the green muse, the green torment, the green oblivion \u2014 might lead one to believe that absinthe is green, right? Often, but not always. The absinthes offered numerous variations on green, from pale celadon and shimmering aquamarine to extra virgin olive oil to dizzyingly garish shades that don\u2019t exist in nature outside of South Beach nightclubs. But one absinthe was turquoise, which is near enough to green, I suppose. Another was mouthwash blue. A few were completely clear. Those were from Switzerland and included our favorite in the tasting, K\u00fcbler. More on that soon enough. What was plain to all of us was that absinthe, stripped of its mystique, can be wonderfully enjoyable but also confusing. For example, the ritual of service: the slow drip of water, from an Art Nouveau fountain through a sugar cube held in a slotted spoon over the glass, seeping down into a pool of green like sweetened tears. Oops, again with the mystique. Here\u2019s what\u2019s important to know: forget the sugar, remember the water. Despite the reverence today for vintage bottles of pre-prohibition absinthe, much of what was produced back in the old days was harsh and industrial. Sugar might have been a necessary addition to make it palatable. The absinthes in our tasting had enough natural (and possibly unnatural) sweetness that adding sugar was unnecessary. The quality of most of them was unexpectedly good. \u201cI was surprised by how few lousy ones there were,\u201d said Pete, whose experiences with contraband absinthes had not always been pleasant. Without water, though, almost any absinthe would be difficult to endure. Absinthe in general is simply too strong to drink undiluted. Of our 20 bottles, 13 were 60 percent alcohol or more. Not only do they require water, they require just the right amount, anywhere from three to five parts water to one part absinthe, the amount rising \u2014 usually but not always \u2014 in tandem with the original strength of each bottle.",

        "article": "Online gaming environments such as World of Warcraft and Second Life would make ideal testing grounds for disease epidemic and virus control, a pair of U.S. scientists say. While computer models and simulations of disease outbreaks are useful, one thing they cannot predict accurately are individual reactions\u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which is where the game worlds come in, according to Eric Lofgren of Rutgers University and Nina Fefferman of Tufts University. Writing in the September issue of The Lancet Infectious Diseases, the researchers say diseases can be introduced into the controlled environments of online game worlds \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2 which are populated by thousands or even millions of individual players \u00e2\u0080\u0094 where their effects can be studied and then applied to real-world epidemic control and prevention. The duo cite a case two years ago where a programming error caused an outbreak of a highly contagious disease within Warcraft, the highly popular online role-playing game, which left thousands of characters dead. The outbreak began in September 2005, when Warcraft's maker, Blizzard Entertainment, released an update that allowed higher-ranked players to access new parts of the game. After combating a creature known as Hakkar, some characters were infected with a disease known as \"Corrupted Blood.\" Higher-level characters experienced few ill effects, but they quickly spread the disease to their lower-level counterparts, who were more susceptible to it. The disease ended up as too contagious for Blizzard to control. After the company failed to seal off a contaminated area of the game world, it resorted to a move not possible in the real world\u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it reset the computers Warcraft runs on, thereby stopping the spread of the disease. The scientists say that virtual simulation through an environment such as Warcraft can bridge the gap between real-world epidemiological studies and large-scale computer simulations by including the variability and unexpected outcomes that arise as a result of the behaviour of individuals. \"We believe that, if the epidemic is designed and presented so as to seamlessly integrate with the rest of the persistent game world, in such a way as to be part of the user's expected experience in the game, a reasonable analogue to real-world human reactions to disease might be observed and captured within a computer model,\" the scientists write. \"By using these games as an untapped experimental framework, we may be able to gain deeper insight into the incredible complexity of infectious disease epidemiology in social groups.\" Fefferman has approached game makers with the idea of studying disease in their online worlds, and says the reaction so far has been one of surprise. \"The first reaction is, 'What?' And the second is, 'I had no idea,'\" she says. Blizzard, however, has been \"incredibly receptive\" and is working with scientists to create a study. Reaction from gamers has been relatively positive as well, she says. Fefferman is hopeful such studies could help determine what kinds of public announcements would be most useful in the case of an epidemic, and how such information could be presented to people without causing a panic.",

        "article": "Chiara Albanese and Christopher Whittall Ukrainian government bonds have been among the world\u2019s worst performing assets in the past year, but a recent rally could gather pace after the International Monetary Fund on Wednesday approved a bailout package for the war-torn country. \u201cThere has been a lot of action in the market today, with investors repositioning on the news of the IMF deal,\u201d said Elbek Muslimov, emerging market trader at Citigroup Inc. Ukraine benchmark bonds maturing in 2023 fell in value from 95 cents on the dollar last July to a low of 39.5 cents on February 23. They have recently recovered, and climbed to 48 cents by Wednesday, rising slightly after the IMF\u2019s announcement. Citigroup\u2019s Mr. Muslimov said the bonds could grind higher into the high 50s to the dollar after the IMF\u2019s announcement that it approved a $17.5 billion rescue package. The bailout is a boost for some of the world\u2019s biggest bond investors, who have been sitting on big paper losses as the country\u2019s civil war strained the economy and financial system, causing the steep downturn in the value of the bonds. U.S. asset manager Franklin Templeton Investments, which has about $185 billion in assets under management, is currently the largest private holder of the country\u2019s debt. It owned about $4 billion worth of the Ukrainian bonds at the end of December, including about $1.8 billion-worth in the flagship Global Bond Fund run by Michael Hasenstab, according to data on the company\u2019s website. A Franklin Templeton spokeswoman declined to make Mr. Hasenstab available for comment. She said Mr. Hasenstab and his fund often takes a contrarian approach to investing. \u201cIt has the research capabilities, size and long-term perspective to buy and hold investments that are out of favor,\u201d she said. Some investors said that despite the recent uptick in the bonds and the IMF bailout, investing in Ukraine is still too risky. \u201cThere is an extreme degree of uncertainty over how much [of the country] will be under Kiev\u2019s control,\u201d said Paul McNamara, investment director of the emerging markets team at GAM Holding AG. Mr. McNamara said he is steering clear of Ukraine\u2019s debt and cited uncertainty over the country\u2019s borders. \u201cYou can talk all the statistics you like, but if you don\u2019t know how much of the industrial region is still part of the country, I don\u2019t see how you can take a view.\u201d Others though say that the bonds are still cheap despite the recent rally. \u201cUkraine is extremely binary,\u201d said Aaron Grehan, an emerging market fund manager at Aviva Investors, speaking before the IMF announcement. \u201cThere is no way of assessing what Ukraine will look like as a country or an economy. [But] the risk reward is such that you want some involvement.\u201d Some analysts signaled the IMF deal should also help bolster the Ukrainian currency. The hryvnia had already eased back from a level of 33 against the dollar in late February to 22 currently, according to data provided by FactSet, after the central bank moved to shore up the currency. \u201cThis should help stabilize the hryvnia. But questions still remain as to what form the restructuring will take,\u201d said Tim Ash, a strategist at Standard Bank, after the aid package was announced. Ukraine\u2019s finance minister will be holding an investor presentation on March 13 to outline the features of the new financing agreement reached Wednesday. This, Mr. Ash said, \u201cwill be key for setting direction [in the bond prices]\u201d.",

Not the one on Tuesday. A nearly full house showed up at this year\u2019s event, the last one with Steven A. Ballmer as the company\u2019s chief executive. While Mr. Ballmer is known for occasional raw displays of emotion, he kept his composure during a speech recapping the high points of Microsoft\u2019s last year. Instead, it was the usually stoic Microsoft chairman, Bill Gates, who choked up. During short remarks, Mr. Gates noted that Microsoft has had only two chief executives in its history \u2014 Mr. Ballmer and himself \u2014 which he said made Microsoft \u201cquite unusual.\u201d The company\u2019s board, he said, wants to make sure that the new chief executive is the right person for this time in the company\u2019s history. Then the voice of Mr. Gates began to break and he paused for a moment. \u201cWe share a commitment that Microsoft will succeed as a company that makes the world a better place,\u201d he continued. Mr. Gates said the Microsoft board had been doing \u201ca lot of meetings\u201d with internal and external prospects for Mr. Ballmer\u2019s job. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at a number of candidates,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not giving a timeline today, but we\u2019re pleased with the progress.\u201d Mr. Ballmer repeated elements of stump speeches he has used in the past. He parried a shareholder question about Microsoft\u2019s weak stock performance under his tenure by saying that company profits had tripled under his watch. He predicted that Microsoft\u2019s brightest days were ahead of it and that a decade from now people would marvel over how small the company was in 2013. Much of the meeting featured the same scripted demonstrations of important Microsoft products and a tallying of votes to re-elect board members, all of whom sat sober-faced in the front row of the hall. A question-and-answer session from Microsoft\u2019s shareholders was no more contentious than it has been in years past. When a shareholder asked Mr. Ballmer if he would be considered a government post, such as a nonexistent position as secretary of national information technology, Mr. Ballmer deflected the question by saying he didn\u2019t think such a job made sense because of the different needs of various government departments. He concluded with an acknowledgement that he would soon have free time on his hands. \u201cThank you for helping try to find me work,\u201d he said.",

        "article": "By Gary Mihoces, USA TODAY In response to a lawsuit filed by the ' former director of security, head coach issued a statement that he never \"abused\" or stole prescription pain medication. The Drug Enforcement Administration has acknowledged that a federal investigation is pending even though the Super Bowl champion Saints said the suit is an extortion attempt based on false claims. In the suit filed Friday in Louisiana 's Jefferson Parish, Geoffrey Santini alleged that two unnamed Saints' staff members were involved in medically unauthorized use of the prescription painkiller Vicodin from the team's supply during the early months of 2009. The suit identified the employees only as \"Senior Staff Member A\" and \"Senior Staff Member B.\" Santini, a former FBI agent, alleged in the suit that one staff member stole pills and that the other used the pills without medical authorization. The suit also accused the Saints of trying to cover up the alleged theft and misuse. The suit, which also said Santini resigned his position with the team last August due to disagreement with management over handling of the matter, seeks damages and back pay. The Saints initially addressed the lawsuit in a statement released Friday by Greg Bensel, the team's vice president of communications. \"A former employee who resigned just before the 2009 regular season threatened to go public with these unfounded charges unless we agreed to pay him an exorbitant sum of money. We refused and now he has gone public,\" said Bensel. \"We will aggressively defend these false allegations in court. We will not have any further comment on this matter at this time. Rather we look forward to welcoming our rookie players and want our focus to be on continuing our preparations for the 2010 football season and defending our title.\" Though Payton was not named in the suit, he released a statement through the team on Saturday. \"I have reviewed Geoff Santini's lawsuit and the unwarranted publicity it has received,\" said Payton, who coached the Saints to a championship over the Indianapolis Colts in February. \"I have never abused or stolen Vicodin or any other medication and I fully support the Saints' position in this matter as expressed by Greg Bensel yesterday,\" said Payton, who has coached the Saints since 2006. NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said, \"We are aware of the lawsuit and that the Saints reject the claims as false.\" Vicodin is a brand name for the drug hydrocodone. It is prescribed as a cough suppressant and as treatment for \"moderate to moderately severe pain,\" according to the website of the Drug Enforcement Agency's Office of Diversion Control. Hydrocodone is described by the DEA as the \"most frequently prescribed opiate in the United States.\" \"Hydrocodone is abused for its opioid effects (its effects as an opiate drug ),\" according to the website, which said abuse can lead to dependence and addiction. The 12-page suit, posted on the Times-Picayune website, says Santini was told in April of last year by Saints head athletic trainer Scottie Patton that Vicodin was missing from a locked drug cabinet. The suit says that later, after a meeting that included Saints general manager Mickey Loomis, two concealed cameras were installed in the cabinet area. The suit says video surveillance later showed one staff member using a set of keys and removing pills from a Vicodin bottle. Santini's suit says he contacted Loomis and told him the staff member's action constituted felony theft of narcotics. The suits contends Loomis told Santini, \"No, this is not a criminal investigation.\" The suit claims another theft of Vicodin by the same staff member was subsequently recorded. The suit accuses Loomis and Patton of \"in effect ... covering up the theft to the doctor (team doctor) who was responsible for the prescription.\" The suit alleges that was done by \"creating false records to conceal both federal and state criminal violations.\" The suit includes transcripts of apparently recorded conversations between Santini and Patton. The suit says that on June 23, Santini reported on the situation to Jim Letten, United States attorney for the Eastern District of Louisiana. The suit also says that on July 30 Santini was contacted by NFL security to \"request additional information because they believed (they) had not been provided with a full and complete facts concerning the missing pills.\" Santini's suit says that on Aug. 11 Loomis told him to \"only give general information\" to team owner Tom Benson about the matter on grounds that the staff members were protected by law governing rights to medical privacy. \"(Santini) objected that the information was not protected because it was part of criminal conduct,\" the suit says. The suit contends that in a later meeting with Benson, Loomis told the owner that both staff members had \"medical suit conditions\" requiring Vicodin. The suit alleges that Patton told Santini that only one of the staff members had such a condition, that was the unnamed staff members who allegedly stole the pills. Santini's suit says he resigned later in August because the team's handling of the matter \"would have constituted state and federal felonies had he acquiesced or participated.\" The suit does not specify the amount of damages sought.

        "article": "Jackson didn't play that night; he later joked that it spared him the embarrassment of running on the court as an irrelevant player with no name and a ridiculous jersey number. \"Then again, it doesn't matter. I'm here,\" said Jackson, a rookie point guard who started this year with the NBA Development League's Erie BayHawks. Jackson now has his preferred uniform with his name and number (9), and whenever he makes his Wizards debut -- possibly Sunday night against the New Jersey Nets (11-65) -- he will become the 24th player to set foot on the court for the team, which will be a franchise record. The Wizards (22-53) had never used more than 21 players before this tumultuous season. They left training camp in Richmond with 15 players, but only five of them remain with the team and are healthy enough to play Sunday: Andray Blatche, JaVale McGee, Nick Young, Mike Miller and Fabricio Oberto. Over the course of the season, six players have been shipped out in trades, two have been bought out, two were suspended for the season, one has been waived, and another left for guaranteed money elsewhere. The Wizards have added another four players in trades, signed one off the scrap heap, and brought in five more players on 10-day contracts. \"It's been in and out. It's been hard. You have relationships with people, you get to know them and then they're gone,\" Young said. \"You try to welcome them in, be cool, good with them and get a good vibe out there on the court. It's like having to start all over, starting a new school or something like that.\" There has been so much movement that four numbers have been worn by more than one player: No. 2 (Shaun Livingston and DeShawn Stevenson), No. 3 (Caron Butler and Quinton Ross), No. 5 (Dominic McGuire and Josh Howard), and No. 33 (Brendan Haywood and Mike Harris). Jackson will make it five, since Paul Davis had No. 9 before him. The Wizards have actually had 27 players on the roster, with Zydrunas Ilgauskas, Drew Gooden and Javaris Crittenton never appearing in a game. Ilgauskas was acquired in a trade with Cleveland for Antawn Jamison but only arrived for his physical before agreeing to a buyout and returning to the Cavaliers. Gooden participated in one morning walk-through and was dealt to the Los Angeles Clippers that night. And Crittenton missed the entire season with a foot injury and a 32-game suspension for his involvement in a gun-related dispute with Gilbert Arenas. The in-season roster moves began and ended with injuries to Randy Foye. A day after he sprained his ankle on Nov. 9, the Wizards signed Earl Boykins, and Jackson joined the team when Foye was lost for the season with a torn ligament in his left wrist. In between, Wizards President Ernie Grunfeld reset the roster with some cost-cutting trades to get the team below the luxury tax threshold, and a season-ending knee injury to swingman Howard created a rotating roster spot. Since Feb. 23, Miller has looked over at the once-empty locker room stall to his left and seen it filled by Harris and Alonzo Gee, who was so quiet and unassuming his first few days in Washington that James Singleton didn't know he was on the team until he looked across the locker room and noticed an unusual nameplate. \"I'm looking like, 'Who's Gee?' \" Singleton said. Gee set the record as the 22nd player to don a Wizards uniform and eventually became a surprise starter. Coach Flip Saunders had hoped to sign him for the rest of the year before Gee bolted for the San Antonio Spurs after his second 10-day contract expired. \"Gee was real shocking,\" Young said. \"Me and him starting talking, getting close and then I came in and somebody said, 'You heard what happened to Gee? He's gone to San Antonio.' I was like, 'How did that happen?' \" The Wizards then replaced Gee with Cartier Martin, another D-League call-up. \"That locker's been a rental spot,\" Miller said with a smile, \"but hopefully Cartier will hold it down for us the rest of the year. We've had a little more unique situation, where we've had to move in and out with players, but that's part of the business I guess. My 10 years, I haven't seen it.\"",

        "article": "The Milky Way contains all kinds of stars \u0097 young ones, old ones, red ones, blue ones, yellowish ones, white ones, ranging in size from much smaller than our sun to tens or even hundreds of times bigger. All told there are at least a hundred billion stars in our home galaxy \u0097 and perhaps as many as 300 billion. But a few members of this vast stellar population have a special claim to cosmic fame. They're racing away from the core of the Milky Way at speeds of up to 1.5 million m.p.h. (2.4 million km/h), on a trajectory that will ultimately take them out into intergalactic space. None of this is entirely surprising to astronomers, or at least, not any more. These so-called hypervelocity stars were predicted back in 1988; the first one was actually discovered in 2005, and by now 21 such stellar speedsters have been observed and confirmed. But a new paper slated for publication in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society suggests that hypervelocity stars may not be the lone wolves they seem. Some of them may be taking planets along with them on their perambulations. And sometimes the planets themselves may go rogue, ripping free and fishtailing off on their own. (PHOTOS: Cosmic Pyrotechnics: New Planetary Nebula Dazzling Astronomers) The reason for all this galactic gadding about: the giant black hole, weighing in at more than 4 million times the mass of our sun, which lurks at the core of the Milky Way. Anything that ventures close to the core orbits the dark monster at high speed. If the \"anything\" happens to be a double-star system (two stars orbiting each other, which is a common thing in the Milky Way) and if the pair gets a bit too close, theory suggests that one member can fall in while the second star is flung out into deep space \u0097 kind of like the \"whip\" in a roller derby. (Our solar system is located a comfortable 30,000 light-years from the galactic center, so we're at no risk of being either swallowed up or hurled to oblivion.) The gravitational breakup of a pair of stellar twins explains how hypervelocity stars came to be, but when Dartmouth astrophysicist Gary Wegner, Dartmouth grad student Idan Ginsburg and his advisor, Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, began looking at the phenomenon more deeply, they began to realize that not only is it entirely plausible for the stars to be accompanied by one or more planets, but also it wouldn't be all that difficult to prove the existence of such free-range solar systems. The Kepler space telescope and some Earth-based observatories have now spotted more than 2,000 so-called exoplanets orbiting distant stars. So big a head count in the brief time scientists have been searching a relatively small patch of sky suggests that there should be billions upon billions of exoplanets out there, making it entirely reasonable to conclude that at least some of them orbit hypervelocity stars. The planets themselves would be far too small and dim to see, but that's not how exoplanets are typically detected anyway. Instead, they're spotted either through the gravitational wobble they cause in their parent star or, a bit more easily, by a slight dimming in light every time the orbiting planet passes in front of the star. It's this second technique that the Kepler space probe, the ground-based MEarth Project and other observing programs use, and it doesn't even take a superpowerful instrument for them to make their discoveries, says Ginsburg. A telescope on the ground with a mirror just 13 ft. (4 m) across could do it, a relative shrimp compared with the 26- to 33-ft. (8 to 10 m) telescopes astronomers now favor. (MORE: Kepler Telescope Finds Swarm of New Worlds) Ginsburg and his colleagues don't expect to spot any planets orbiting hypervelocity stars just yet, in part because 21 such wandering bodies are an awfully small sample group. What's more, a planet would have to be aligned just right for the light dimming to be observable. \"Still,\" says Ginsburg, \"we think it's worth looking. And if observers don't find any in this first round, they can wait for more hypervelocity stars to turn up.\" If such planets do exist, the odds would be exceedingly slim they'd contain life: they'd have to be in very tight orbits to avoid having been stripped away by the black hole, making things too hot for biology to get started \u0097 though planets around dim hypervelocity stars might find things a bit more comfortable. Least comfortable \u0097 and certainly loneliest \u0097 of all would be planets that were blazing through space entirely by themselves, ripped free of their parent star by the same whipcrack power of the black hole and flung free on their own. There'd be nothing, in theory at least, to prevent this from happening, and the authors of the Monthly Notices paper even went so far as to estimate just how fast the planets might be traveling: a blazing 30 million m.p.h. (48 million km/h) \u0097 or close to 5% of the speed of light \u0097 thanks mostly to their smaller mass. This is one case, of course, in which theory bumps up against the limits of technology. With no star to jostle or dim, the planets would be entirely undetectable \u0097 at least given the limits of current telescopes. It's enough, perhaps, to know that those planets may be out there, and to contemplate not just how solitary their travels are, but also how much more they'll be when they reach the end of the Milky Way and sail off into the ocean of true intergalactic space.

        "article": "The federal Department of Education would categorize Michelle L\u00f3pez-Mullins \u2014 a university student who is of Peruvian, Chinese, Irish, Shawnee and Cherokee descent \u2014 as \u201cHispanic.\u201d But the National Center for Health Statistics, the government agency that tracks data on births and deaths, would pronounce her \u201cAsian\u201d and \"Hispanic.\" And what does Ms. L\u00f3pez-Mullins\u2019s birth certificate from the State of Maryland say? It doesn\u2019t mention her race. Michelle L\u00f3pez-Mullins is critical of the many different methods she encounters for categorizing race and ethnicity. Articles in this series explore the growing number of mixed-race Americans. Ms. L\u00f3pez-Mullins, 20, usually marks \u201cother\u201d on surveys these days, but when she filled out a census form last year, she chose Asian, Hispanic, Native American and white. The chameleon-like quality of Ms. L\u00f3pez-Mullins\u2019s racial and ethnic identification might seem trivial except that statistics on ethnicity and race are used for many important purposes. These include assessing disparities in health, education, employment and housing, enforcing civil rights protections, and deciding who might qualify for special consideration as members of underrepresented minority groups. But when it comes to keeping racial statistics, the nation is in transition, moving, often without uniformity, from the old \u201cmark one box\u201d limit to allowing citizens to check as many boxes as their backgrounds demand. Changes in how Americans are counted by race and ethnicity are meant to improve the precision with which the nation\u2019s growing diversity is gauged: the number of mixed-race Americans, for example, is rising rapidly, largely because of increases in immigration and intermarriage in the past two decades. (One in seven new marriages is now interracial or interethnic.) In the process, however, a measurement problem has emerged. Despite the federal government\u2019s setting standards more than a decade ago, data on race and ethnicity are being collected and aggregated in an assortment of ways. The lack of uniformity is making comparison and analysis extremely difficult across fields and across time. Under Department of Education requirements that take effect this year, for instance, any student like Ms. L\u00f3pez-Mullins who acknowledges even partial Hispanic ethnicity will, regardless of race, be reported to federal officials only as Hispanic. And students of non-Hispanic mixed parentage who choose more than one race will be placed in a \u201ctwo or more races\u201d category, a catchall that detractors describe as inadequately detailed. A child of black and American Indian parents, for example, would be in the same category as, say, a child of white and Asian parents. The new standards for kindergarten through 12th grades and higher education will probably increase the nationwide student population of Hispanics, and could erase some \u201cblack\u201d students who will now be counted as Hispanic or as multiracial (in the \u201ctwo or more races category\u201d). And reclassifying large numbers of white Hispanic students as simply Hispanic has the potential to mask the difference between minority and white students\u2019 test scores, grades and graduation rates \u2014 the so-called achievement gap, a target of federal reform efforts that has plagued schools for decades. \u201cThey\u2019re all lumped together \u2014 blacks, Asians and Latinos \u2014 and they all look the same from the data perspective,\u201d said Daniel J. Losen, a policy expert for the Civil Rights Projectat the University of California, Los Angeles, referring to the Department of Education aggregation. \u201cBut the reality is much different. There are different kinds of discrimination experienced by these subgroups.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a big problem for researchers,\u201d Mr. Losen continued, \u201cbecause it throws a monkey wrench in our efforts at accountability, student tracking and the study of trends.\u201d Education officials say the changes will more accurately reflect how Americans see themselves. The standards were also devised to save schools time and money. If schools were to report on every possible racial and ethnic combination to the federal authorities, there would be dozens of possibilities. It is simply easier to call students \u201ctwo or more races.\u201d \u201cUltimately, the department\u2019s final requirements aim to strike the balance,\u201d said Russlynn H. Ali, the department\u2019s assistant secretary for civil rights, \u201cbetween minimizing the burden for local education agencies while also ensuring the availability of high-quality racial and ethnic data.\u201d But critics, including elected officials and the Citizens\u2019 Commission on Civil Rights, a Washington group that monitors federal policy and practices, have called the move disturbing and want more transparency. While the policy was still in developmental stages, the commission urged the Department of Education to \u201cevaluate alternative approaches, including those adopted by the U.S. Census\u201d to track students\u2019 race.

In his weekly national address, President Obama sang the praises of the Democrats\u2019 financial regulatory legislation, saying that the combination of tax cuts for small businesses, investments in clean energy and new restrictions on Wall Street will fuel the economic recovery. \u201cNow, I can\u2019t tell you that this plan will bring back all the jobs we lost and restore our economy to full strength overnight,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cThe truth is, it took nearly a decade of failed economic policies to create this mess, and it will take years to fully repair the damage. But I am confident that we are finally headed in the right direction.\u201d Mr. Obama took Representative John Boehner of Ohio to task, criticizing the minority leader\u2019s call for a repeal of the health care law and his desire to extend the Bush tax cuts for wealthiest Americans. Mr. Boehner responded immediately, calling Mr. Obama\u2019s remarks \u201cpartisan attacks.\u201d \u201cThe fact is that Washington Democrats\u2019 policies have created uncertainty that has undermined our economy, shaken the confidence of the nation, and cost millions of American jobs,\u201d Mr. Boehner said. G.O.P. Address: In the Republican weekly address, Representative Mike Pence of Indiana called on Congress to extend the Bush tax cuts in an effort to buoy up the still struggling economy. \u201cAfter 18 months of runaway spending, bailouts and takeovers, Washington Democrats are poised to allow the largest tax increase in American history to take effect next year,\u201d said Mr. Pence, who is the chairman of the House Republican Caucus. \u201cThe American people know we can\u2019t tax and spend and bail our way back to a growing economy,\u201d he said. \u201cHouse Republicans opposed the Democrats\u2019 failed stimulus bill, their national energy tax, their government takeover of health care and House Republicans will oppose this tax increase with everything we\u2019ve got.\u201d Rangel\u2019s Denials: Representative Charles B. Rangel and the House ethics committee had been exploring a settlement to the numerous accusations against him for more than a month, but the talks broke down Thursday amid frustration over Mr. Rangel\u2019s refusal to admit any wrongdoing, The Times\u2019s David Kocieniewski and Eric Lipton report.

        "article": "The government was yesterday urged to publish a highly critical official report which concludes that soldiers' lives in Afghanistan are being put at risk by \"political fudge\" and Whitehall incompetence. The 296-page report by Bernard Gray, a former senior Ministry of Defence adviser, warned of \"lethal\" weakness in government programmes and failings so bad they \"harm our ability \u2026 to conduct difficult current operations\". It was commissioned by the former defence secretary John Hutton but suppressed by ministers who feared the impact of its findings, according to the Sunday Times, which obtained a leaked copy. As casualty figures continue to rise in Afghanistan, Labour has come under increasing pressure over the issue of defence procurement, with complaints about a lack of helicopter support and sufficiently armoured vehicles for troops. Gray, who directed the strategic defence review of 1998 before becoming a successful businessman, found that: \u2022 On average, new equipment arrives five years late and costs 40% more than first estimated. \u2022 The MoD equipment programme is \u00a335bn over budget. \u2022 The incompetence is helping enemies who \"are unlikely to wait for our sclerotic acquisition systems to catch up\". \"How can it be that it takes 20 years to buy a ship, or aircraft, or tank?\" Gray wrote. \"Why does it always seem to cost at least twice what was thought? Even worse, at the end of the wait, why does it never quite seem to do what it was supposed to? The issue is a mystery, wrapped in an enigma, shrouded in an acronym.\" The report warned of \"too many types of equipment being ordered for too large a range of tasks at too high a specification\". It said delays in the shipbuilding programme meant Britain could not have fought a Falklands-style campaign in the last 20 years. \"We would have risked significant casualties, the very significant costs of acquiring adequate equipment at short notice (if available) or the embarrassment of not fighting at all.\" The shadow defence secretary, Liam Fox, said the report exposed a \"black hole\" in the defence budget and called on the government to publish it in full. \"It is serial incompetence by the Labour government and the Ministry of Defence to allow our defences to get to this state,\" he said. Gray said administrative chaos was having a serious impact on Britain's ability to wage war. Armed forces minister Bill Rammell denied troops' lives were being put in jeopardy because of procurement process failings. \"Lives are not being put at risk,\" he said. \"Nevertheless, it is critically important that we constantly seek to get the best value for money in what is an enormous equipment purchase programme.\"",

        "article": "Imagine a typical four-course dinner at a linen-napkin restaurant. The lighting? Soft. The music? Refined. The date? This is the scenario that plays out each weekend for some of the country\u2019s 90 million singles and others without a dining partner. For some of them, eating alone is a lonely experience. Many welcome it. \u201cI find it really nice,\u201d says Charly Laura Rok, 41, senior vice president of media at New York City-based communications firm Lippe Taylor. \u201cI can read, I can work, I can daydream, and very often I strike up conversations with other solo diners.\u201d Bite Into The Big Apple One spot catering to diners like Rok is New York\u2019s Gotham Grill. The Alfred Portale-owned restaurant in Greenwich Village plays host to dozens of deal makers and couples splurging on dishes such as Maine lobster risotto and frozen Banana Charlotte. But take a seat at the bar, and you\u2019ll be treated as if your check is the staff\u2019s biggest transaction of the day. \u201cThey make everyone feel comfortable,\u201d says Rok, who eats there regularly. \u201cThe service is great no matter if you\u2019re dining alone or with a group of people.\u201d Top Tips Similar spots exist throughout the world. The trick is identifying them. Restaurants with sizable bars or communal tables provide a comfortable setting for those eating alone, says Liz Johannesen, restaurant marketing manager at OpenTable.com, an online reservation network for restaurants throughout the U.S., the U.K., Canada, Mexico, Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore. Those saddled up to the bar may talk to the bartender and neighboring diners. Communal tables allow parties of one to blend into the crowd. Scenery also plays a role, Johannesen says. While dining, nothing beats a stellar view when faced with an empty seat across the table. That\u2019s what visitors to Chicago\u2019s Park Grill find. It borders Millenium Park along Michigan Avenue; those lucky enough to snag outdoor seating in the summer can take in frequent performances by live bands. In the winter, window seats overlook an ice-skating rink. Reputation is also important. If your spot has received high ratings for service in local reviews or in the Zagat or Michelin guides, then it\u2019s safe to assume it will put a premium on pleasing solo diners. But what if you\u2019re fortunate enough to snag a reservation for one, yet unfortunate enough to be placed at a table that\u2019s anything but pleasing\u2013either right next to the kitchen or, even worse for some, in a corner far away from other diners? Speak up. \u201cAs a guest, you\u2019re entitled to what you want,\u201d says Johannesen, who adds that hosts at spots offering fine dining make a point of seating guests at tables where they will be most comfortable. She adds, though, that the bar might well be your best bet. \u201cPersonally, I love banquettes,\u201d she says, \u201cbut if there aren\u2019t any available, I find that the bar tends to be the most lively and entertaining spot in the room.\u201d In Pictures: Perfect Places To Dine Solo Comments are turned off for this post.",

        "article": "WASHINGTON -- As President Obama weighs major shifts in strategy in the deteriorating mission in Afghanistan, the Senate on Tuesday passed a bill bringing total U.S. tab for that war to about $300 billion. The $626 billion measure, passed 93-7, also would ban outright any transfer of accused enemy combatants from the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detention facility into the United States. Current law permits transfer of detainees to face trial or go to prison. The underlying bill combines $128 billion for overseas military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan with $498 billion for the rest of the Defense Department's budget. An analysis by congressional researchers puts the tally for Afghanistan at about $300 billion and for Iraq at more than $700 billion since Sept. 11, 2001 -- totaling more than $1 trillion. This winter, Obama approved 21,000 more troops to Afghanistan, which would bring the total number of U.S. forces there to 68,000 by the end of the year. The Pentagon bill approved Tuesday funds that deployment. The bill must now be reconciled with a measure that passed the House this summer and will then be presented to Obama for his signature. Besides Guantanamo, the most controversial issues to be resolved in House-Senate talks may involve efforts by House lawmakers to skirt a promise by Obama to veto the legislation for funding over-budget replacement helicopters for the presidential fleet. Obama has issued a weaker threat to veto efforts to keep funding a program to develop a second engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the Air Force's major new weapons system. On Afghanistan, Obama is weighing a request from Gen. Stanley McChrystal for as many as 40,000 additional troops. The request is being met with skepticism from many lawmakers in Obama's party and would eventually need separate funding in a future war appropriations bill. The measure would bring to more than $1 trillion approved by Congress for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, according to the latest analysis by the Congressional Research Service. And there's also ample skepticism in Congress that Obama's Iraq and Afghanistan funding request will be sufficient to last the entire 2010 budget year, which began Oct. 1. A key lawmaker, Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa., predicts that additional money will be needed next spring. The measure does, however, give Obama and Defense Secretary Robert Gates a partial victory in their drive to kill off weapons systems that are behind schedule and over budget. The Senate bill, for instance, follows Obama's push to kill the F-22 air-to-air combat fighter and the VH-71 replacement presidential helicopter. And it does not contain money for the second engine for the F-35 fighter, which would be built by General Electric Co. and Rolls-Royce in Ohio, Indiana and elsewhere. The main F-35 engine is built in Connecticut by Pratt & Whitney. The House bill contains $560 million for the alternative engine. The White House issued a squishy veto threat, saying Obama would kill the bill if it would \"seriously disrupt the F-35 program.\" It's widely expected that the final House-Senate measure will include funds for the second engine. Obama and Defense Secretary Robert Gates have staked their prestige on killing several over-budget weapons systems, especially the F-22, which has its origins in the Cold War era and is poorly suited for anti-insurgent battles in Iraq and Afghanistan. But in twin victories for the Boeing Co., the Senate measure includes $2.5 billion to fund 10 C-17 cargo planes assembled in Long Beach, Calif., which were not requested, and $512 million for nine more F-18 Navy fighters than Obama requested. They would be assembled in St. Louis. A White House position paper on the bill says the administration \"strongly objects\" to the decision for additional C-17s, but that fell far short of the veto threats that have been the key to killing the F-22 program and the much-criticized presidential helicopter. An effort by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., on Tuesday to kill the additional C-17s failed by a 30-68 vote. The Senate's strict language on Guantanamo meant that the chamber avoided a difficult floor fight. The companion House bill would permit transfer of Guantanamo prisoners for trial or imprisonment after a two-month delay and an assessment of the risks. But just last week, the White House was on the losing end of a lopsided vote to ban all transfers of Guantanamo detainees to the U.S., and it looks increasingly unlikely that the administration will be able to close the Guantanamo Bay prison by January as Obama has promised. The measure also contains $2.7 billion worth of pet projects sought by senators, commonly known as \"earmarks,\" including funding for-profit companies to develop new technologies. The Senate by voice vote rejected a bid by McCain to require earmarked for-profit companies to be subject to competitive bidding, in keeping with reforms instituted by the House.",

        "article": "Soldiers arrive at their home base in Fort Hood, Texas, last week after being one of the last U.S. combat units in Iraq. Atlanta (CNN) -- Soldiers who just returned from Iraq are among several thousand being ordered to Afghanistan in six months as part of a mission designed to beef up Afghan forces ahead of a planned 2014 U.S. military withdrawal, officials said. News of the pending Afghanistan deployments came as families at bases across the country were celebrating the return in recent days of troops who turned off the lights at a number of U.S. bases ahead of an end-of-the-year deadline to leave Iraq. U.S. general brings Baghdad standard home \"We are glad that we have brought all soldiers back home in time for Christmas to spend with loved ones. We do have to put information out about an upcoming mission, though,\" the 4th Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division, said Tuesday on its Facebook Page. In the posting, the brigade said it was one of four selected to \"support a Security Force Assistance Mission to Afghanistan in early summer.\" \"We just received initial planning orders so lots of details are unknown,\" it said. \"...The mission is part of the transition from combat operations to advisory mission as we did in Iraq and is a sign of progress.\" Analysts: Questions remain as U.S. troops leave Iraq Maj. Carla Thomas, a brigade spokeswoman, confirmed the validity of the Facebook announcement. The new mission is part of an overall U.S. military exit strategy from Afghanistan that moves troops from a combat role to advise-and-assist positions that commanders and analysts say will significantly scale back operations ahead of President Barack Obama's self-imposed deadline to leave the country. Earlier this year, the United States outlined its plan to withdraw its troops, beginning by pulling 33,000 \"surge\" troops deployed to help quell the violence by the end of 2012. The remaining 68,000 troops would be withdrawn by the end of 2014. News of the deployments comes as the Obama administration pushes to accelerate the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, a plan that many military commanders have said is unreasonable in a country still trying to gain its security footing. \"I don't think we are going to turn around guys who spent time in Iraq and put them on planes to Afghanistan ... without there being a clear indication that the Obama administration wants to continue the acceleration of the withdrawal,\" said Bill Roggio, Editor of The Long War Journal & Senior Fellow at The Foundation for Defense of Democracies. \"U.S. commanders want to stop with the withdrawal of the 33,000 (surge troops.) They want to halt it.\" Marine Corps Gen. John Allen, commander of the International Security Assistance Force, has said he would like to keep a U.S. \"military presence\" in Afghanistan beyond 2014 when NATO is scheduled to withdraw its forces. Allen suggested the presence could last as long as 2016 when the Afghan Air Force is completed. Allen told reporters last week there is \"no daylight\" between him and the White House on this idea. Allen said he wants to shift the U.S. presence to an advisory capacity in the coming months and then continue to do that mission after 2014. Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has asked Allen to review the counterinsurgency strategy and determine what changes are needed. Allen said he has to complete the review before he can decide on the rate of drawdown of current U.S. force levels. The new mission in Afghanistan somewhat mirrors the U.S. exit strategy in Iraq, which used advise and assist teams to improve counterterrorism operations and train security forces. Just like in Iraq, small teams of American troops will work and live among security forces, and will help coordinate military operations, according to comments Allen made to reporters last week. In its Facebook posting, the 4th Brigade Combat Team said those who would be deployed in advise-and-assist roles would be senior enlisted personnel, ranging from master sergeants to colonels. The deployment was expected to last nine months, though it was unclear how many members of the brigade will deploy. Also being deployed are troops from the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division from Fort Stewart, Georgia; the 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division from Fort Carson, Colorado; and the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 101st Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. The brigade deployments were first reported this week by Stars and Stripes, a newspaper that caters to military personnel. Under an Army policy, troops are given one month of dwell time for every month they are deployed. In the case of 1st Armored Division's brigade, which returned in December after less than six months in Iraq, its soldiers could be sent to Afghanistan as early as May. The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment. Messages left early Wednesday by CNN at public affairs offices at the 3rd Infantry Division, the 4th Infantry Division and the 101st Airborne Division were not immediately returned. Reactions at Fort Bliss were mixed with some soldiers and families telling CNN by telephone that they were resigned to the specter of an Afghanistan deployment, while others said they were surprised elements of the brigade would be deployed so soon after returning from Iraq. None of the soldiers or their family members were willing to be quoted, citing possible repercussions over speaking to the media without prior approval. Responses to the brigade's Facebook post, though, revealed the feelings of spouses and family members. \"All we can do is enjoy the time we have with them,\" one person wrote. Another wrote: \"Not even home a week. How sad.\" Questions remain about the stability of Afghan forces, with some questioning whether an Iraq-style exit strategy can work in Afghanistan. \"Given that we are 10 years into this, my confidence level is pretty low that we can turn the Afghan forces around,\" Roggio said. Taliban must have clear representative for peace talks, Karzai says The U.S.-led war in Afghanistan began October 7, 2001, with an air campaign that was followed within weeks by a ground invasion. President Barack Obama has called it \"the longest-running war in the nation's history\". As the United States turned its attention toward Iraq, insurgent violence in Afghanistan flared against Afghan civilians and security forces as well as the U.S. and its coalition partners. In 2009, President Obama authorized a surge of 33,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan to combat the violence. Earlier this year, the president announced a plan to withdraw its troops. The move was followed by withdrawal announcements by most of the NATO nations. CNN's Barbara Starr contributed to this report.",

        "article": "Benjamin Moore\u2019s 2016 Color of the Year was officially announced last week: Simply White. With memories of the earthy Marsala (Pantone\u2019s 2015 Color of the Year) and vivid Coral Reef (the Sherwin-Williams 2015 choice), how could a plain vanilla get such an exalted ranking? \u201cWhite is transcendent, powerful and polarizing \u2014 it is either taken for granted or obsessed over,\u201d Benjamin Moore Creative Director Ellen O\u2019Neill said in the company\u2019s announcement. The release also said that this particular color was chosen from the company\u2019s more than 250 selections of white paint because \u201cit was the most neutral, level and constant in the various light sources used in today\u2019s design environments.\u201d Reaction in the design community was not surprise, but rather a bit of caution. Miles Redd, a New York designer known for his richly hued interiors, was rooting for a daffodil yellow or maybe a shade of blue. \u201cI don\u2019t think of white as a color. But I know it is. I live in technicolor,\u201d Redd said. \u201cMost people do go for white paint. Color is something people don\u2019t always know how to handle. I guess it\u2019s not surprising given that white sheets and white towels are the number one sellers, too.\u201d Washington interior designer Mary Douglas Drysdale was not surprised. \u201cI think it\u2019s consistent to where design has been moving over the past three to four years. There is a paring back and a real simplification. I think it has to do with the interest in de-cluttering,\u201d Drysdale said, praising the choice. \u201cIt\u2019s not one of those treatments that is a weird color that everybody can\u2019t have. It\u2019s about the democratization of design.\u201d Tips on choosing paint colors \u201cI have never met a white I didn\u2019t like,\u201d said Margaret Russell, editor in chief of Architectural Digest. She then retracted that when she recalled that she had to have a new apartment repainted because the white was too beige. \u201cI love the fact that Benjamin Moore chose a white, because it calls attention to the fact that there are so many nuances in white. You just want it to be the right one.\u201d For professional color consultants, choosing a specific white paint always requires a lot of testing. Jean Molesworth Kee, whose Alexandria business is the Painted Room, has been seeing a lot of white in European design blogs and thinks white will replace gray as the hot color. Kee, whose own home is painted Benjamin Moore\u2019s Linen White, counsels that Simply White is just one of many neutral choices. \u201cA huge caution to people choosing colors on Pinterest. You should only use that as inspiration; you have to test it in your own house.\u201d Actually, she said, white isn\u2019t right for every home. \u201cWhite is at its most gorgeous in Southern California and Australia where there is beautiful light,\u201d said Kee. \u201cIf it\u2019s somewhere there is no light, it goes shadowy and dies.\u201d \u201cWhite is my favorite color,\u201d said Erin Paige Pitts, a designer with offices in Maryland and Florida. \u201cMy kids joke that there is no such color in their art classes. But my house is almost all white.\u201d She explained that Simply White has a bit of yellow in it, which makes it more cheerful than some whites. \u201cIt\u2019s fresh and clean and bright,\u201d Pitts said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good choice.\u201d The home and design coverage of Jura Koncius has taken her inside hundreds of homes, from tiny studios in Penn Quarter to country castles in Warrenton. Jura also hosts the Home Front live chat, Thursdays at 11 a.m. ET.",

        "article": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. \u2013 A Republican state lawmaker says a new California law allowing transgender students to choose which restroom and locker room they use is part of the reason at least one of his sons will not return to his local public school this fall. Assemblyman Tim Donnelly, who lives in the Southern California mountain community of Twin Peaks, described his family's decision in a column published on WND, a conservative website. He wrote that under the bill from Assemblyman Tom Ammiano, D-San Francisco, the privacy rights of California students \"will be replaced by the right to be ogled\" and will encourage inappropriate behavior among hormone-driven teenagers. \"While trying to address a concern of less than 2 percent of the population, California is now forcibly violating the rights of the other 98 percent,\" Donnelly wrote. Gov. Jerry Brown signed the bill into law Monday, making California the first state to put such transgender protections into statute. Donnelly told The Associated Press on Friday that his 13- and 16-year-old sons, who attend Rim of the World Unified School District in the San Bernardino Mountains, were \"horrified\" to learn they might have to share a restroom with female students. He is pulling one son out of middle school, while another son is uncertain if he will return to his public high school. The decision is one that his family already had been discussing before the bill was approved. \"If it doesn't change his school experience, he may still stay,\" Donnelly said of his high-school student. \"We don't know yet how this policy is going to affect our town.\" A message left with the school district's superintendent's office was not immediately returned. The law, which will take effect Jan. 1, gives students the right \"to participate in sex-segregated programs, activities and facilities\" based on the gender they identify with as opposed to their birth gender. Those programs also include sports teams. Supporters said it will help reduce bullying and discrimination against transgender students and note that the state's largest school district, Los Angeles Unified, has had such a policy for nearly a decade. But detractors say allowing students of one gender to use facilities intended for the other could invade the other students' privacy. Donnelly, who is exploring a bid for governor next year, said he is hearing concerns from a growing number of parents across the state. Some of those parents have told him they also plan to remove their students from public school, although he said the parents he has spoken with have declined to speak publicly about their decision. Donnelly's comments Friday came as two conservative groups opposed to the law, the Sacramento-based Pacific Justice Institute and Capitol Resource Institute, filed language for a ballot referendum with the state attorney general's office seeking to repeal AB1266. The justice institute also is distributing a form that parents can send to school districts, stating that their child's rights include the right to privacy from students of the opposite gender in situations such as changing clothes. Brad Dacus, the institute's president, said the organization has drawn significant interest from parents who are upset by the new law. He said the form \"puts the school district on notice that students aren't surrendering their rights to privacy.\"",

        "article": "Robert Wright for The New York Times \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not an unkind person,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Trudie Styler, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut by the same token, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not a people-pleaser.\u00e2\u0080\u009d DURING a visit to India to celebrate her 50th birthday, Trudie Styler consulted a seer. Recently, she recalled the episode, highlighted by a reading of her Vedic chart, with mock incredulity. \u201cOh, madam, by golly, this chart is very unique,\u2019 \u201d she was told. \u201c \u2019By 2012, you could be asking for the Taj Mahal \u2014 and you would get it.\u2019 \u201d At the time, she was unmoved. \u201cI was thinking, \u2018What would I do with a mausoleum?\u2019 \u201d she said. What indeed? Now 58, Ms. Styler is mistress not only of a spacious aerie on Central Park West, where she sat serving guests espresso last week, but also of six lavish homes scattered from London to Los Angeles; she owns a wardrobe that Eva Per\u00f3n might have envied, her Versace-sheathed comings and goings tirelessly documented by a doting fashion press. And invitations to her charity balls are among the most coveted in town. She also makes movies, sells organic produce farmed on her various estates and has raised four comely children, ages 17 to 28, the offspring of her 30-year relationship with and 20-year marriage to (but you knew this) Gordon Sumner, a k a Sting, the sinewy pop idol. At 60 still a magnet to besotted fans, he is her rock: subsidizing her gilt-edged life and flaunting her virtues as if by rote. \u201cWhen I met her, she was beautiful,\u201d he said the other day, breezing in from their terrace, which overlooks Central Park West. \u201cBut then I figured out that she was smart, much smarter than me.\u201d And yet for Ms. Styler \u2014 who has fashioned herself as an unlikely hybrid of charity-driven social diva and, yes, brainy jill-of-all- trades \u2014 too much, it seems, is never enough. Earlier this month, she pulled off the latest of her social coups, producing her biennial benefit for the Rainforest Foundation, which she and Sting founded in the late 1980s, flexing her skills as a celebrity wrangler to persuade, among others, Meryl Streep, Elton John, James Taylor and Bruno Mars to belt out show tunes at Carnegie Hall. Afterward, at a dinner and live auction at the Pierre Hotel, Bill Clinton, Ms. Styler\u2019s guest of honor, mingled with Aretha Franklin and Tom Hanks, then ogled Jennifer Hudson, prying his eyes away just long enough to explain what had induced him to come. \u201cSting and Trudie and I have been friends for a long time,\u201d Mr. Clinton said, stealing a glance at his hostess, whose clingy white Pucci gown showed the outline of her underwear. Oh, and yes, \u201cI believe in their cause.\u201d Ms. Styler, it seems, can embrace any cause with a vengeance. \u201cIf I\u2019m connected to an idea, it just doesn\u2019t let me go,\u201d she said the other day. \u201cAll I have to do is catch up to the image in my head by doing the practical steps to get there.\u201d At the moment those practical steps revolve as well around shaking the perception that she is little more than the fashion plate, unregenerate gadabout and celebrity consort best known to New Yorkers as Mrs. Sting. She has engaged the high-powered publicist Matthew Hiltzik, whose clients have included Harvey Weinstein, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Katie Couric, to promote her achievements. As a Unicef ambassador, her official biography states, Ms. Styler helped transfer hundreds of Ecuadorean children from the dumpsites where they worked to new schools. She has also aided in the installation of water filtration tanks in the area. The rain forest event, sponsored by Revlon this year, took in some $3 million, according to Sting, much of it earmarked for the rescue of the Amazonian jungle. A health and fitness evangelist, Ms. Styler also makes wine on her estate in Tuscany and has turned her passion for the downward dog into profit, producing six yoga DVDs, the latest one distributed in overstuffed gift bags to her guests at the Pierre. And that is the upside. These days Ms. Styler seems just as sharply focused on exerting a little damage control. In London, Trudie-baiting has been something of a blood sport, dating roughly from the time when Ms. Styler spirited Sting away from his first wife (and her neighbor), Frances Tomelty, an actress. Today journalists routinely take aim at her high-consumption way of life, one that encompasses not just the half-dozen homes (one of which is an 800-acre estate in Wiltshire, England) but a personal entourage including a chef, a private secretary and a hairdresser who travels with her everywhere. A life, in short, that is glaringly at odds with her image as socially conscious Granola Lady. This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A previous version of this article erroneously stated Sting\u00e2\u0080\u0099s age as 63. Sting is 60. Also, the court case referred to in the piece was in 2007, not last year. A previous version of this article erroneously stated Sting\u00e2\u0080\u0099s age as 63. Sting is 60.

        "article": "In a stunning victory Tuesday, Arkansas Sen. Blanche Lincoln proved she was a survivor in an anti-incumbent year by winning a squeaker of a race against Lt. Gov. Bill Halter in a runoff election for her party's nomination. Defying expectations, Lincoln had been on the ropes against Halter, who had the support of big labor unions and liberal groups like MoveOn.org. But Lincoln had the support of former President Bill Clinton, an Arkansas native, and President Obama, whose spotty record this year had seemed unlikely to offer Lincoln much added value. In her victory speech, Lincoln said the voters sent a message that was loud and clear. \"Washington needs to work for us, work for Arkansas and this senator is going to be part of the solution,\" she said to thunderous applause. Lincoln faces Rep. John Boozman, R-Ark., in the November election. Republican Sen. John McCain won the presidential contest in Arkansas in 2008 by 20 points. With expectations that Lincoln would not survive the night, a Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee source told Fox News earlier Tuesday that Democrats \"weren't going to win Arkansas anyway\" in November. Labor unions and MoveOn.org will have to turn around from their vehement opposition of Lincoln in the primary to support for her in the general election. Democratic leaders also quickly jumped on Lincoln's bandwagon, eyeing the general election in November. \"For Democrats in Arkansas to be successful this November, we must be aggressive in framing the choice for voters,\" DSCC Chairman Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., said in a written statement. \"Democrat Blanche Lincoln is focused on creating jobs, farmers and the needs of the middle class while John Boozman has made it clear he would do even more to protect Wall Street, the oil companies and the insurance companies. Given that Arkansas cannot afford a return to the failed economic policies of the past, the stakes for November could not be higher,\" he said. \"With the primary behind them, Arkansans now have a clear choice in November: elect Sen. Lincoln, who has fought and will continue to fight tirelessly for Arkansas families, or elect a longtime special interest advocate like John Boozman,\" Democratic National Committee Chairman Tim Kaine said in a written statement. Republican leaders agreed there's a clear choice. \"Sen. Lincoln survived this intra-party war by fully embracing her liberal Washington record, but she faces an uphill battle explaining to mainstream Arkansas voters why she has consistently voted for the Obama-Pelosi-Reid economic agenda in Washington,\" said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. \"With John Boozman as our nominee, I believe that this seat will be a prime pick-up opportunity for our party this November. Congressman Boozman is a proven leader who represents Arkansans' best interests, and he will continue to stand up to the Obama administration and fight for much-needed checks-and-balances in the U.S. Senate.\" Tuesday's victory allowed Lincoln to avoid the fate of her other Senate colleagues who were ousted last month. Sen. Arlen Specter lost to Rep. Joe Sestak in the Pennsylvania Democratic primary, and Sen. Bill Bennett, R-Utah, didn't even make it onto the ballot in his state's GOP convention. Incumbents in the House haven't been immune to voter anger either. Reps. Alan Mollohan, D-W.Va., and Parker Griffith, R-Ala., lost their jobs last month. The Arkansas contest was just one of several held in 12 states as a new survey finds deepening anti-incumbent sentiment among the electorate and antipathy toward elected officials. Unpopular Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada and vulnerable Sen. Barbara Boxer of California won their token races handily, but have to navigate new waters in their strategies for he general election. A victory in the California GOP Senate primary for former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina turns the Senate race into an all-female battle that pits a corporate titan against a three-term senator. Boxer leads Fiorina in general election polls. Reid faces an upstart challenger that came from obscurity into Tea Party favor in the space of six weeks. Women also did well in other races. Former eBay CEO Meg Whitman won the California Republican gubernatorial primary to challenge Attorney General Jerry Brown. In South Carolina, state Rep. Nikki Haley was just shy of winning an outright victory against U.S. Rep. Gresham Barrett for the Republican nomination in the state's gubernatorial race. They go to a runoff on June 22. The winner will face Democratic state Sen. Vincent Sheheen in November. In South Dakota, state Rep. Kristi Noem defeated two other Republicans on Tuesday to win the GOP congressional nomination. She faces Democratic Rep. Stephanie Herseth Sandlin in the November election. In other races, Brian Sandoval defeated Gov. Jim Gibbons for the GOP gubernatorial nomination in Nevada. The U.S. District Court judge will challenge Reid's son, Rory Reid, in the general election. In north Georgia, Republican Tom Graves was elected to the U.S. House in a special election runoff. U.S. Rep. Joe Wilson, best known for shouting \"You lie!\" at the president, won his primary rematch over Barnwell businessman Phil Black. Wilson also beat Black by an overwhelming margin in 2008. The 62-year-old real estate attorney will face Democrat Rob Miller, a former Marine captain who also saw his campaign coffers fill after Wilson's outburst. Wilson beat Miller two years ago in the district that stretches from the state capital to the southern coast. South Carolina Sen. Jim DeMint, a Tea Party favorite who has become something of a conservative kingmaker, coasted to a GOP primary win against a little-known challenger who used to be a Democrat. House Majority Whip James Clyburn easily defeated his challenger in the Democratic primary in South Carolina's 6th District. Businessman Gregory Brown was the first primary challenger for Clyburn since 2002. The 69-year-old congressman has held the seat for 18 years.

        "article": "(DES MOINES, Iowa) \u2014 A white man with a history of racial provocations and confrontations with police ambushed and fatally shot two white officers in separate attacks as they sat in their patrol cars, authorities said. Police took 46-year-old Scott Michael Greene into custody hours after the killings early Wednesday, less than three weeks after he argued with officers who removed him from a high school football game where he had unfurled a Confederate flag near black spectators. Greene flagged down an Iowa Department of Natural Resources employee in a rural area west of Des Moines, identified himself and asked that the employee call 911. Sheriff\u2019s deputies and state patrol officers took him into custody. Green has not been formally charged, but he remained hospitalized Thursday for treatment of an existing condition, Des Moines police Sgt. Paul Parizek said. Police planned to provide an update on the case later in the day, he said. Greene\u2019s suspected in the early morning slayings of 24-year-old Justin Martin, who had been with the force in the Des Moines suburb of Urbandale since 2015, and 38-year-old Sgt. Anthony Beminio, who joined the Des Moines department in 2005. Police responded to a report of shots fired shortly after 1 a.m. and found the Urbandale officer. Authorities from several agencies soon saturated the area. About 20 minutes later, they discovered the Des Moines officer, who had responded to the first shooting, Parizek said. The shootings happened less than 2 miles apart, and both took place along main streets that cut through residential areas. In the first shooting, investigators believe the gunman walked up to the officer\u2019s car and fired more than two dozen rounds. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it a confrontation,\u201d Urbandale Police Chief Ross McCarty said. \u201cI don\u2019t think he may have even been aware that there was a gunman next to him.\u201d The shootings follow a spate of police killings in recent months, including ambushes of officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Five officers were killed July 7 in Dallas. Three more were killed later that month in Baton Rouge. Race was an issue in those cases and others involving unarmed black men killed by officers. Greene is white, as were the officers. Greene appeared to have issues with people of other races. In the confrontation at the Urbandale High School football game, which Greene videotaped and posted on social media, he appeared to be trying to antagonize African-American fans when he shook a Confederate flag in front of them during the national anthem, McCarty said. In the video, officers can be seen asking Greene to leave school property while he insists he was assaulted and his flag was stolen. He demands officers file theft and assault charges, saying someone hit his head and grabbed the flag. In a back-and-forth with officers that lasts for nearly 11 minutes, officers say they could take a report but they cannot let Greene back inside the stadium because the school has banned him from the property. They also note they were returning his flag and ask if he purposely wanted to create a conflict by displaying it near African-Americans. \u201cI was peacefully protesting,\u201d he responds. \u201cThat\u2019s my constitutional right.\u201d The video ends with Greene promising not to \u201cset foot on\u201d school property and officers saying they will take down his information. Ardis Gardner of Des Moines told The Associated Press he was at the Oct. 14 football game to watch his teenage son play. Gardner, 47, who is black, sat with a group of other friends and family members when Greene, who was dressed in Army fatigues, approached them within a few feet and waved the flag at them during the national anthem. \u201cI was angry,\u201d said Gardner, who typically sits during the national anthem and prays. \u201cIt was senior night, and the spotlight should have been on those senior players. This was calculated for him to do it at that moment.\u201d A week later, Gardner said, Greene followed him and a group of black parents into another football game with a dog that was wearing a gun holster and a Confederate flag vest. Greene sat nearby again. After the video was posted on YouTube, someone identifying himself as Scott Greene commented, \u201cI was offended by the blacks sitting through our anthem. Thousands more whites fought and died for their freedom. However this is not about the Armed forces, they are cop haters.\u201d In other incidents, court records show Greene was jailed and charged with interfering with official acts after resisting Urbandale police officers who tried to pat him down for a weapon on April 10, 2014. An Urbandale officer described him as hostile and combative. Greene entered a guilty plea and was fined. Two days later, Urbandale police were called to answer a complaint of harassment at the apartment complex where Greene lived. The complaint said he threatened to kill another man during a confrontation in the parking lot and yelled a racial slur used against blacks. Greene was charged with harassment. He pleaded guilty and received a suspended jail sentence and a year of probation. An officer wrote that Greene had complied with the terms of his probation, noting that he had obtained a mental health evaluation and \u201creports to have complied with the medication recommendations.\u201d The officer did not elaborate. Soon after the football game incident, on Oct. 17, a criminal complaint indicates Greene was involved in an altercation with his 66-year-old mother. Greene accused her of scratching and hitting his face. He captured the fight on cellphone video, which he used as evidence of the assault. A judge ordered Greene\u2019s mother to stay away from her son, and she was released on $1,000 cash bond. The Urbandale police chief said Greene was well-known to officers. Most officers in the city \u201chave some understanding of Mr. Greene,\u201d McCarty said. \u201cThey\u2019ve taken trips to his house, delivered service to him \u2014 never anything to this extent.\u201d It was unclear if either of the shootings was captured on police cameras. Greene has a daughter who attends Urbandale High School. The Urbandale shooting occurred near the school, and the city\u2019s entire school district closed for the day. The attacks on police this summer in Dallas and Baton Rouge came in the wake of several high-profile police shootings of black men, fueling a national debate about police use of force, especially against minorities. It has been a frequent topic in the nation\u2019s presidential race. Republican nominee Donald Trump has argued that police need the freedom to use greater force. Democrat Hillary Clinton has supported officers while calling attention to what she and others have called examples of bias in policing. Parizek, the police spokesman, said the officers\u2019 deaths are a blow to the city. \u201cThey are our friends and co-workers,\u201d he said. \u201cDes Moines is not a big city. We all know each other. We\u2019re heartbroken.\u201d Associated Press writers David Pitt and Barbara Rodriguez in Des Moines, Ryan J. Foley in Iowa City and Nelson Lampe in Omaha, Nebraska, contributed to this report.",

        "article": "Uh-oh. A month before the election, incumbent Republican senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, who is up for reelection, has had to make an \u201cI\u2019m not perfect\u201d ad: In a debate on Monday night against challenger Maggie Hassan, the Democratic governor, Ayotte was asked whether Donald Trump would be a good role model for children. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d she replied. Ayotte, a centrist Republican, has been trying to have Trump both ways all year, saying she would vote for him but not endorse him. Quickly after the debate, Ayotte sought to walk back her statement about Trump, saying that she had misspoken. But Hassan is out this morning with an ad seeking to pin her more closely to the top of the ticket: A HuffPost Pollster average of polls in the senate race has it tied: An Ayotte loss would be a significant blow to Republican efforts to hold the senate. The Democrats need to flip four seats \u2013 and for Clinton to win the presidency \u2013 to gain control of the senate. (If the Democrats get four seats, a 50-50 tie would be established, with straight party-line votes thereafter being resolved by the vice president, whoever he may end up being.) The Democrats look very likely to flip in Illinois and Wisconsin. But they may lose the Nevada seat of retiring minority leader Harry Reid. So they may need at least three more wins from among the five states of Indiana, North Carolina, Missouri, Pennsylvania or New Hampshire. To see a map with further analysis, pay a visit to Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball. Republicans are worried that Trump is screwing up their chances of holding onto Congress, report Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns today in the New York Times: Donald J. Trump\u2019s support has plunged across the swing-state map over the last 10 days, wiping out his political recovery from September and threatening to undo weeks of Republican gains in the battle for control of Congress. [...] Mr. Trump has already slipped perceptibly in public polls, trailing widely this week in Pennsylvania and by smaller margins in Florida and North Carolina \u2014 three states he cannot afford to lose. But private polling by both parties shows an even more precipitous drop, especially among independent voters, moderate Republicans and women, according to a dozen strategists from both parties who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the data was confidential.

        "article": "(CNN) -- Three days before the Boston Marathon bombings, suspects Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev were working out together at a Boston gym. Security cameras captured footage of the brothers arriving at the Wai Kru mixed martial arts center with a friend just before 2:45 p.m. April 12. The manager at Wai Kru, who wanted to be identified only as Michael, noticed a distinct change in the older brother's appearance. Tamerlan Tsarnaev's full, bushy religious beard, which he had for about two years, was gone. Michael described the older brother as extremely opinionated and outspoken about his Muslim religion. He said he didn't ask Tamerlan why he had shaved because he didn't want to engage in what was likely to be a long, heated debate. Now, Michael wonders whether Tamerlan's shaving of his beard may have been part of an Islamic purification ritual prior to death. \"Shaving the beard may be a way to blend in, not to attract scrutiny from security services in carrying out the Boston attacks,\" CNN terror analyst Paul Cruickshank said. Tamerlan Tsarnaev trained at Wai Kru several times a month, for free, as a professional courtesy to the nationally ranked Golden Gloves boxer. His younger brother Dzhokhar rarely came, showing up just \"two or three times\" in roughly two years, Michael said. \"We've seen with Western militants, wanna-be jihadists, a real emphasis on physical training, physical fitness, wanting to be prepared for jihad,\" Cruickshank said. In surveillance video recorded at Wai Kru and obtained by CNN, the manager -- who was off-camera -- asked the brothers to take off their shoes, as stated on the gym's posted rules. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, complies right away. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, refuses to take off his shoes and argues instead. The manager later e-mailed the owner asking him to ban Tamerlan Tsarnaev, saying he's arrogant, selfish and never helps anyone else. But the argument at the the gym that day didn't seem to faze Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was the first to enter the ring. His years of training were evident as he skillfully handled the jump rope. His younger brother seemed to have more difficulty and less stamina as he struggled to hold up his oversized shorts. Another man who was with the brothers was introduced as a friend, the manager said. He was later questioned and released by the FBI. The brothers seemed relaxed at the gym -- though Dzhokhar rested at times and Tamerlan kept moving. Almost exactly 72 hours later, the bombs exploded near the finish line of the Boston Marathon. In the chaotic days that followed, Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed in a police shootout, and his younger brother was captured after hiding in a boat in nearby Watertown, Massachusetts. FBI agents have seen the security footage from Wai Kru but were in a rush and took only a few screen grabs for still photos. The manager said he notified investigators about another Chechen -- Ibragim Todashev, a friend of Tamerlan Tsarnaev's who also worked out at the gym. Todashev was shot and killed last week by an FBI agent. He was being questioned about a triple homicide on September 11, 2011. One of the victims from that triple homicide used to spar with Tamerlan -- at the Wai Kru gym.",

        "article": "LAS VEGAS, Nev.\u2014 Richard Bunker, the chairman of the Nevada Gaming Control Board, was nearing the end of a long soliloquy last week about gambling, the prosperity of Nevada and the public's perceptions of Frank Sinatra. Mr. Bunker was the last to speak at a five-hour hearing at which Mr. Sinatra was seeking permission to reenter the gambling business 17 years after he had been banned because of alleged ties to organized crime. ''I've reached the point in my life that I don't really care what people outside of Nevada think of gaming,'' the chairman said, ''the national media or anybody else.'' A few moments later, after declaring that the board had examined every allegation ever made about Mr. Sinatra's purported underworld ties and had found no evidence to support them, Mr. Bunker said not everybody in the gaming industry can be expected to be ''choir boys.'' He then joined other members of board in voting to allow the singer back in, at least for six months. The allegations have hounded Mr. Sinatra for decades. Among other things, they led to a cooling of a once-close friendship with President Kennedy and, more recently, to criticism of President Reagan for his close relationship with the singer. Mr. Sinatra listed Mr. Reagan as a reference in his application for a gaming license. After the vote, an aide to Mr. Sinatra said that the board's decision would end once and for all the ''innuendoes'' about Mr. Sinatra. The aide seemed to suggest that the proceedings had cleansed the singer's reputation sufficiently to vindicate the President's friendship with him. Others who attended the hearing said they felt Mr. Sinatra had gone a long way toward answering the old allegations. At the same time, however, it appeared that he had not laid them to rest. In what at times resembled testimonial, a Roman Catholic priest, an educator, a Las Vegas newspaper publisher and two film actors, Gregory Peck and Kirk Douglas, lauded him as a ''humanitarian'' who tirelessly donated his time and talents to good deeds. In the strongest testimony on his behalf, Peter Pitchess, the Los Angeles County Sheriff, said he had looked into the reports of Mr. Sinatra's criminal connections and had been unable to find any substance. One of Mr. Sinatra's lawyers said he had obtained the Federal Bureau of Investigations' complete file on the singer - it weighed 14 pounds, he said - and he characterized it as full of unsubstantiated complaints and anonymous letters. Members of the board, which had seen the same file, had clearly come to the same conclusion. Mr. Sinatra testified for almost two hours; he admitted knowing several Mafia members, but not very well, and he firmly denied having any underworld business connections. ''I have never had anything to do with them businesswise and rarely socially - no connection whatsoever,'' he said. Investigators for the Gaming Control Board were asked if they had been able to prove any allegations of underworld ties, and said they could not. Less Than Met the Eye All the old charges appeared to have been dispensed with. Yet, at least some observers said afterward that they felt there was less to the hearing than met the eye. Mr. Sinatra was treated with a kind of awe. He and his lawyer-manager, Milton Rudin, appeared to know many of the panel's questions in advance. Board investigators seemed to base many of their conclusions solely on the singer's own word; on some points, their fact-finding appeared to have been naively superficial. Asked about his relationship with Aladena (Jimmy the Weasel) Fratianno, a Mafia assassin who claims in a current best-selling book to know the singer very well, Mr. Sinatra asserted that they had met briefly only once, or possibly twice. The Gaming Control Board did not challenge him. Ovid Demaris, author of the book, ''The Last Mafioso,'' claims that he has interviewed numerous witnesses who support Mr. Fratianno's claim of friendship, but it appeared that little effort had been made to confirm that. Several times, when asked a potentially embarrassing question, Mr. Sinatra said that his memory failed him; he also gave some puzzling replies. In answering a question about the incident that led to the loss of his gaming license in 1963, he firmly denied knowing that the late Sam Giancana, a Chicago mobster, had visited the Cal Neva Lodge in violation of state laws barring gangsters from casinos. But when asked if he had ever admitted knowing Mr. Giancana was there, he answered, ''I might have said almost anything; if I said it, I don't believe I meant it because I never saw him.'' Although Mr. Pitchess said he knew of no evidence supporting the old charges about Mr. Sinatra, he seemed to undermine the credibility of his own testimony by saying repeatedly that he was a close and old friend of the singer. Most people attribute the founding of modern Las Vegas to the late Bugsy Siegel, a gangster who arrived in a tiny desert hamlet after World War II and started a gambling industry that was for many years - until the state began to clean it up - a virtual fiefdom of organized crime. Federal investigators claim Eastern crime syndicates still own hidden interests in a number of major hotel-casinos. Whatever Mr. Sinatra's relationships might have been with the underworld, no matter whether he had been treated unfairly by the press, as he claims, there appeared to be a desire at the hearing to reinstate him, if for no other reason than that he's good for business. As one witness, a casino owner, said: ''Whenever Mr. Sinatra plays on the Strip, my (establishment) is full.'' Illustrations: photo of Frank Sinatra",

        "article": "ON Monday the Supreme Court will consider whether to fundamentally alter the way American patent law is litigated. Specifically, in the context of an otherwise unremarkable patent dispute, the Court has promised to decide the degree to which juries should be allowed to question whether a patent should have been issued at all. It\u2019s a critical issue: the current approach, under which juries are explicitly discouraged from questioning a patent\u2019s validity, all too often means that dubious patents are nevertheless enforced. That inhibits innovation, the very thing that patent law is supposed to encourage. A patent\u2019s validity is first judged at the United States Patent and Trademark Office, where thousands of experts on everything from business practices to stereo equipment toil to evaluate every submitted application. It\u2019s a herculean task: inventors have filed more than 450,000 applications every year since 2007; last year the number was close to 500,000. To accurately evaluate all of those purported inventions would cost tens of billions of dollars, multiples more than what the Patent Office receives in federal outlays or could plausibly raise on its own with application fees. As a result, patent examiners give most applications only a quick look, spending on average 16 hours to 17 hours per application \u2014 nowhere near the time needed to assess whether an invention is truly new and not obvious. Worse, those hours are typically spread over two to three years, and they are interspersed with work on hundreds of other open files. These problems could in theory be fixed with more money. But resources aren\u2019t the only issue. The extent and quality of Patent Office review is also limited by the fact that the process is not adversarial. Indeed, the only parties involved in Patent Office review are the applicant and the applicant\u2019s lawyers \u2014 people with an obvious incentive to see the application move forward. Contrast that with litigation, where patent plaintiffs have to square off against very motivated patent defendants. Why, then, does the current system discourage juries from second-guessing the Patent Office? The primary reason is that judges are reluctant to invite lay jurors to overrule the experts. That makes sense in the abstract. But in practice, even the best examiners are so overwhelmed and so poorly informed that the benefits of their expertise are fully dissipated. Juries know less, true, but at least they get to see a complete evidentiary record and to hear arguments on both sides. The consequences of misplaced Patent Office deference are significant. A patent holder whose patent covers a technology that was in fact obvious to the world has a strong incentive to sit quietly after the patent is issued. Other parties will inevitably come up with same idea on their own; when they do, the patent holder can threaten litigation and as a result extort cash from companies that neither knew of nor remotely benefited from the patent holder\u2019s work. Indeed, a growing number of \u201cpatent trolls\u201d employ this exact strategy today, using bad patents to literally tax legitimate business activity. If the current approach were abandoned and juries were instead given real freedom to review patent validity, not much would change at the Patent Office. Examiners would still evaluate the validity of patent applications and document their views. And, in the event of litigation, those views would still be admissible in court. The key difference would be that the examiner\u2019s view would then rise or fall on the merits, rather than enjoying substantial deference from the jury. With this reform in place, the patent system would still protect genuine inventions. But it would also give relief to the countless businesses that today find themselves vulnerable to patents that shouldn\u2019t have been issued in the first place. After all, reform is not just about helping patent holders. Patent reform is also about protecting companies of all stripes from a patent system that would otherwise dangerously overreach.

        "article": "CreditHilary Swift for The New York Times When Nancy Balbirer and Howard Morris met as drama students at New York University in 1983, they developed a crush on each other that almost led to romance. \u201cI loved him immediately, and I practically threw myself at him,\u201d said Ms. Balbirer, then an 18-year-old freshman. \u201cHe was cute, funny and very smart, and he had the most exciting and fabulous energy of anyone I had ever known.\u201d Mr. Morris, then a 19-year-old sophomore, was equally smitten. \u201cShe was extremely attractive, sexy and very outgoing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe really hit it off.\u201d Despite their instant chemistry, the aspiring actors \u2014 she from Weston, Conn., and he from Newton, Mass. \u2014 shared nary a kiss. \u201cThe problem was me,\u201d said Mr. Morris, who is now 51 and based in Los Angeles, where he is the executive producer and co-creator of the Netflix comedy series \u201cGrace and Frankie.\u201d \u201cI absolutely wanted to date her,\u201d he said, \u201cbut she was more mature than I was and sort of intimidated me. I guess I wasn\u2019t ready for her emotionally.\u201d They settled on being friends, which frustrated Ms. Balbirer, who is now 50 and a New York-based writer and actress. \u201cHowie always had a girlfriend,\u201d she said, but \u201cthat girlfriend was never me.\u201d They spent the next few years honing their respective crafts \u2014 Mr. Morris eventually delved into playwriting \u2014 and bouncing around campus in Lower Manhattan, often enjoying lunch together. \u201cNancy was always nice enough to pay,\u201d Mr. Morris said, adding \u201cbecause I was always broke.\u201d As the end of college approached, his crush persisted, but so did his inability to step up and express his feelings. Rather than cause a scene, he chose to create one. He wrote a school play \u2014 \u201cabout a guy with a broken heart,\u201d he said \u2014 called \u201cAlmost Romance,\u201d a comedy in which he cast himself in the lead and Ms. Balbirer as his love interest. (The four-person play also featured a fellow drama student named Jeremy Piven, of future \u201cEntourage\u201d fame.) \u201cHow would you feel about making out with Howard Morris, the lead actor in my play?\u201d Mr. Morris asked Ms. Balbirer. If only for a scripted New York minute, she was thrilled to become his leading lady. \u201cIt was a lot of fun,\u201d she said. \u201cMy goodness, I didn\u2019t have to do any acting when it came to making out with Howie.\u201d In addition to what he called \u201cthe perfect kiss,\u201d Mr. Morris was soon reaping other benefits from his production. A director who had seen and enjoyed the play took it to the Manhattan Punchline Theater, which had a reputation for producing comedy writers. \u201cAlmost Romance,\u201d with Fisher Stevens and Helen Slater in the lead roles, ran for nearly seven weeks to favorable reviews, and by the time the final curtain closed, Mr. Morris had an agent and some name recognition in the industry. In 1991, he moved to Los Angeles to join the staff of the HBO sitcom \u201cDream On.\u201d He was soon noticed by Marta Kauffman, a television writer and producer who had created that show and was also a creator of \u201cFriends.\u201d (Ms. Kauffman and Mr. Morris eventually created \u201cGrace and Frankie,\u201d which debuted last year.) With his writing career on the rise, Mr. Morris married in May 1994, which became a bittersweet time for an old castmate, who was still single. \u201cAt that point, I had kind of resigned myself to the fact that even though I felt we were perfect for each other, Howie would never feel that way,\u201d Ms. Balbirer said, adding, \u201cI just figured it was time to move on.\u201d Four months later, she did just that, moving \u2014 of all places \u2014 to Los Angeles to pursue acting. She eventually landed parts including three episodes of \u201cSeinfeld,\u201d and resumed her old role as frequent lunch partner of Mr. Morris. \u201cWe clearly still had strong feelings for each other, but it was completely platonic,\u201d she said. They remained close friends, and in 1999, the same year Ms. Balbirer wrote \u201cTake Your Shirt Off and Cry\u201d \u2014 a book, she said, \u201cabout the perils of being a woman in show business\u201d \u2014 she invited Mr. Morris to her own wedding in Los Angeles, which he attended. \u201cThough I was happily married, I must admit to feeling a tinge of sadness that day,\u201d he said. By 2002, Mr. Morris, who had a 2-year-old son, was in the throes of a divorce. That same year, Ms. Balbirer, whose career focus had shifted to writing, moved back to New York with her husband. \u201cJust when I needed my best friend the most, she was leaving,\u201d Mr. Morris said. She became what he called \u201cmy email shoulder to lean on.\u201d In March 2011, it was Mr. Morris\u2019s turn to lend a shoulder as Ms. Balbirer separated from her husband, with whom she had a 6-year-old daughter. \u201cWe were calling it a temporary separation at that time,\u201d she said. But by July, her separation became permanent. To make matters worse, her beloved dog, Ira, died shortly afterward. \u201cI was feeling numb and going through therapy, just trying to figure out what was going on in my life,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was like I was trapped in a bad dream.\u201d",

        "article": "GENEVA \u2014 FIFA acknowledged Wednesday that past World Cups were awarded based on bribes, and the organization wants US prosecutors to give it \u201ctens of millions of dollars\u201d seized from the former FIFA officials who took the cash. FIFA submitted a 22-page claim to the US Attorney\u2019s Office in New York on Tuesday that seeks a big share in restitution from more than $190 million already forfeited by soccer and marketing officials who pleaded guilty in the sprawling corruption case. Tens of millions of dollars more is likely to be collected by US authorities when sentences are handed down, and from dozens of officials currently indicted but who have denied bribery charges or are fighting extradition. FIFA claims it is the victim of corrupt individuals, despite widespread criticism that bribe-taking was embedded in its culture in the presidencies of Joao Havelange and Sepp Blatter, who was forced from office after 17 years by the current scandal. \u201cThe convicted defendants abused the positions of trust they held at FIFA and other international football organizations and caused serious and lasting damage to FIFA,\u201d FIFA President Gianni Infantino said Wednesday in a statement. \u201cThe monies they pocketed belonged to global football and were meant for the development and promotion of the game. FIFA as the world governing body of football wants that money back and we are determined to get it no matter how long it takes.\u201d In documents seen by the Associated Press, FIFA asks for: \u2022 $28.2 million for years of payments, including bonuses, flights and daily expenses, to officials it now says are corrupt \u2022 $10 million for the \u201ctheft\u201d of money that FIFA officials transferred as bribes to then-executive committee members to vote for South Africa as 2010 World Cup host \u2022 \u201csubstantial\u201d cost of legal bills since separate US and Swiss federal probes of corruption in international soccer were revealed last May \u2022 damages for harm to its reputation, plus other bribes and kickbacks for media rights to non-FIFA competitions but \u201cwhich were made possible because of the value of the FIFA brand\u201d \u201cFIFA has become notable for the defendants\u2019 bribery and corruption, not its many good works,\u201d lawyers for soccer\u2019s world body state in the claim. \u201cFIFA is entitled to restitution for this harm to its business relationships, reputation and intangible property.\u201d FIFA\u2019s grab for a share of the money sets up a battle with two of its regional confederations \u2014 CONMEBOL, the South American confederation, and CONCACAF, the body running soccer in North America. It was officials and competitions from those regions that were most involved in the corruption crisis. It also signals a change in strategy for FIFA, after months of senior officials distancing Zurich from the scandal, instead blaming confederations which are beyond its control. Most of the already seized money \u2014 $151.7 million \u2014 will come from Brazilian marketing executive Jose Hawilla, whose group of agencies were heavily involved with matches CONCACAF and CONMEBOL controlled but not FIFA directly. In an initial claim for $28.2 million, FIFA specifies an amount for each of 20 men from the Americas over many years that it says it should be repaid from money held by US authorities. FIFA wants more than $5.3 million it spent on Chuck Blazer, the disgraced American official who has pleaded guilty, allocates $4.4 million of its claim for former FIFA vice president Jack Warner, and $3.5 million for Ricardo Teixeira, Havelange\u2019s former son-in-law from Brazil. Warner, a long-time powerbroker from Trinidad and Tobago until resigning in a 2011 election bribery scandal, is identified by FIFA in its 22-page claim for receiving a $1 million bribe from 1998 World Cup bid candidate Morocco, and ensuring the $10 million bribe from South Africa was paid via a FIFA account in 2008. FIFA claims a further $2 million for payments to Jeffrey Webb, the Cayman Islands banker who was arrested at a luxury Zurich hotel last May, and now lives at his home near Atlanta, Georgia, awaiting sentencing in June. \u201cThese dollars were meant to build football fields, not mansions and pools; to buy football kits, not jewelry and cars; and to fund youth player and coach development, not to underwrite lavish lifestyles for football and sports marketing executives,\u201d Infantino said. It is unclear how much influence Infantino, a former lawyer, had in the restitution claim since he was elected only three weeks ago, with strong support from voters in the Americas. Infantino\u2019s signature pitch to voters on election day was about finances, saying bluntly \u201cIt\u2019s your money.\u201d That resonated with members of CONMEBOL and CONCACAF, who have had a combined $20 million in central funding frozen by FIFA. CONCACAF, based in Miami, has had its past three presidents implicated in the US case. But it has passed wide-ranging reforms to clean up its operations, and has targeted restitution money to rebuild. \u201cCONCACAF views itself as a victim of a number of the offenses described in the indictments and intends to seek restitution at the appropriate time,\u201d the regional body said in a statement.",

The singer/songwriter, who is best known for her hits \u201cDamn, I Wish I Was Your Lover\u201d and \u201cAs I Lay Me Down,\u201d has also starred in Room 105 and on Community. Already mom to 6-year-old son Dashiell, Hawkins, 50, is pregnant with her second child \u2014 a girl! \u2014 after being implanted with her own frozen embryo. You can find her on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter @therealsophieb. \u201cI wasn\u2019t free until I had my children,\u201d I thought, standing on a golf course covered in snow. On the border of the sloping field stood naked trees, each one unique and captivating. Bleak winter takes their leaves and, if it didn\u2019t, we\u2019d never see what they are really made of. I imagined people I know without their leaves: What are they made of? What do they really look like near the end of a long, cold time? This winter has been a trial for me, physically and emotionally. Pregnancy is uncomfortable and draining, and the end isn\u2019t in sight until it becomes unbearable. No, my doctor won\u2019t let me look forward to a scheduled C-section. \u201cYou\u2019re not high-risk,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I\u2019m 50!\u201d I remind her. \u201cYou\u2019re healthy and your baby is healthy,\u201d she retorts. Well, this pregnancy has really stripped my leaves, and I\u2019m starting to know what I\u2019m made of. During the first three months, there were moments when I thought I made a mistake, when the positive notions about having a second child couldn\u2019t overpower the nausea and dread that I was ruining my son\u2019s life and my own. I woke up depressed and befuddled by my bizarre life planning. I recounted the warnings of those from whom I had sought advice: \u201cNow that you\u2019re unburdened, why would you have a second child?\u201d \u201cHow could you take attention away from your son?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re robbing Peter to pay Paul.\u201d Even my mother thought I was a cockeyed optimist. \u201cI\u2019ll support you emotionally, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea,\u201d she cautioned. A year ago, as I was coming up the dimly lit stairs of our dingy, overpriced apartment building, I witnessed an old man making the arduous journey down. Alone and fragile, he had the air of an abandoned man. When I entered my apartment and closed the heavy door, I cried because I wouldn\u2019t be alive to take care of Dashiell when he\u2019s old. That my son might ever be so alone as to appear forgotten was too much to bear. \u201cI have to have another child. I have to bring someone into this world that will be here for Dashiell.\u201d This and other visions, including the solidarity I\u2019m rebuilding with my siblings, kept bringing up the question of when would I have another child, not why. I thought of adopting; I called a few agencies \u2014 yet I had the embryos of my egg, plus my son\u2019s sperm donor in storage, so it seemed worth the effort of being pregnant to bring a person into our lives in a similar way that my son was brought into mine \u2026 And yet I dragged my feet. I wasn\u2019t ready to let go of being the mother of one, knowing that two would make us a stronger family. A mother at Dashiell\u2019s school confided that she felt she was \u201ccheating\u201d on her daughter when she had her son five years later; she felt she was having an illicit relationship. \u201cWill I still be your favorite son when Bubble Gum is born?\u201d my son asked tonight. He is the greatest love I\u2019ve known, and in recent years, the only love I\u2019ve truly wanted to explore. After the breakup with my partner of 17 years, I haven\u2019t wanted to share my heart with anyone but my son, and it has been positively wonderful. So, is that where freedom awaits, in an opening heart? I have a feeling. I could have chosen a suitor, a grown-up love affair that may turn into the new parent of my son and then have a baby together, or perhaps I would\u2019ve fallen in love with someone who has children, built-in siblings. But from experience, I know that most falling in love ends with a thud after two years, and then my son would have to go through another traumatic loss, and he\u2019d think I was insane and lose trust in me. While the rewards of a new adult relationship can be totally fulfilling, the rewards of having a new baby are so much greater. And so is the commitment, which is why it\u2019s so scary. Marriage is a walk in the park compared to being a single mother or father. I\u2019ll take that walk later. For now, I\u2019m seven months pregnant and I\u2019ve started to feel I\u2019m carrying a person, not just my son\u2019s sister. The first few presents of tiny baby clothes have been arriving and I\u2019m stunned at how small this person will start out, and I\u2019ve wondered where she will sleep. The buds are appearing on the trees outside, yet I feel I\u2019m going to be naked, leafless, for many months to come. My true friends, and my son, see me with kind eyes. I feel it. So that\u2019s the freedom my children have given me. To be naked in the world with an open heart. More from Sophie\u2019s PEOPLE.com blog series:",

        "article": "The Fair Work Commission would gain new powers to order employers to create permanent jobs to replace casual employment and work on successive temporary contracts under a new Greens policy. The Greens want to legislate to give casuals and employees on successive fixed-term contracts who have been in a workplace for more than 12 months a right to request secure and ongoing work. Employees whose request for permanent work is refused would be able to ask the Fair Work Commission to order their employer to give them a permanent full-time or part-time job. Related: Insecure work, loss of entitlements, underpayment \u2013 it's all in a day's work | Van Badham The Greens\u2019 policy would also allow unions and employer organisations to apply to the commission for orders that prospective employees, casual employees or those on rolling contracts be given permanent work. The orders could apply to individual workers, groups or whole classes of workers in any industry, with any kind of work or type of employer. Small businesses with fewer than 15 employees would be exempt from the legislation. The Greens\u2019 industrial relations spokesman, Adam Bandt, will announce the policy on Friday in the inner Sydney electorate of Grayndler with the senator Lee Rhiannon and the Greens candidate Jim Casey, who is the state secretary of the Fire Brigade Employees Union. The secure work orders have the capacity to shake up industries that use large numbers of casuals and employ workers on rolling fixed-term contracts, like the higher education sector. Bandt said: \u201cMore and more people are under pressure because they don\u2019t have a secure income or decent work. \u201cRising job insecurity is affecting people\u2019s ability to live and plan their lives. \u201cYoung workers in particular are under immense pressure, with unaffordable housing, higher student debts and more young people in casual work than any other age group. \u201cPeople working for years as casuals or going from one fixed-term contract to another often struggle to take out a mortgage or even sign a lease.\u201d Under the plan employers could refuse requests for casuals or workers on rolling contracts to convert to permanent employment but would have to detail their reasons. That refusal could be overturned by the Fair Work Commission. The commission would have to consider allowing employers to continue to use contract and casual labour where it is \u201cgenuinely appropriate having regards to the needs of the business\u201d. Related: The new jobs reality: we're becoming a nation of hustlers | Brigid Delaney Casey said: \u201cSydney is one of the most expensive cities in the world and the inner west is rapidly becoming so expensive that those who work here can hardly afford to live here. \u201cThe rise of short-term and casual work is making it harder for people to afford to live in inner-west Sydney.\u201d Bandt said: \u201cPolls are suggesting that a hung parliament is increasingly likely after this election. If the Greens hold the balance of power after this election, we will seek to place issues like tackling increasing job insecurity at the centre of the new government\u2019s agenda.\u201d Bandt has also refused to rule out legislating to protect weekend rates should the commission cut penalty rates for retail and hospitality workers. The Fair Work Commission is currently considering a case to cut Sunday penalty rates to Saturday levels in the retail and hospitality industries. On Thursday the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, said he did not support cutting Sunday penalty rates to Saturday levels but he would accept the decision of the independent tribunal. At its national conference in July, Labor approved changes to its platform to \u201creduce the incidence of underemployment and insecure work\u201d including by delivering \u201can objective test for determining when a worker is a casual\u201d.",

The network will add just one new hourlong series in the fall, a drama called \u00e2\u0080\u009cHostages,\u00e2\u0080\u009d starring Toni Collette and Dylan McDermott. Large swaths of this season\u00e2\u0080\u0099s schedule are expected to remain intact next fall, like the combination of \u00e2\u0080\u009cNCIS\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cNCIS: Los Angeles\u00e2\u0080\u009d on Tuesdays, and its four franchises on Sundays, \u00e2\u0080\u009c60 Minutes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Amazing Race,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Good Wife,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Mentalist.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because CBS is in an enviable position, with higher ratings than any other broadcaster and fewer failures from the current season. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is a schedule built to last,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said CBS\u00e2\u0080\u0099s scheduling chief Kelly Kahl.

The first of its new comedies, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe Are Men,\u00e2\u0080\u009d will come on Mondays at 8:30 p.m., supported by the final season of \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow I Met Your Mother\u00e2\u0080\u009d at 8.

        "article": "The government's \"back to work\" schemes, which were challenged by a graduate who was made to work for free at Poundland and an HGV driver made to clean furniture, were legally flawed, the UK's highest court has ruled. The supreme court ruled against the Department for Work & Pensions (DWP), which was attempting to overturn an earlier verdict by the court of appeal. The supreme court stopped short of ruling that the regulations constituted forced or compulsory labour, but said the 2011 regulations creating the programme were invalid as they did not contain a sufficiently detailed \"prescribed description\" of the schemes. Geology graduate Cait Reilly, 24, who now works for the supermarket chain Morrisons, first disputed the government's employment schemes in January 2012 after working unpaid for Poundland over several weeks at pain of losing jobseeker's allowance. The judgment would have resulted in the government having to refund \u00a3130m to about 250,000 unemployed people for unlawful sanctioning, had it not been for emergency retroactive legislation introduced by Iain Duncan Smith in the spring. After the introduction of that emergency law, the solicitors Public Interest Lawyers (PIL), who represent Reilly and her co-claimant, Jamieson Wilson, an unemployed lorry driver, lodged a judicial review accusing Duncan Smith of conspiring to undermine basic human rights by enacting the retroactive legislation. They say they will continue to pursue that judicial review after their success in the supreme court. In a statement outside the court, the lawyer Tessa Gregory said: \"We are delighted that the supreme court has dismissed the government's appeal and confirmed that the regulations under which most of the 'back to work' schemes were initially created were unlawful. \"The court upheld the findings that Iain Duncan Smith acted beyond the powers given to him by parliament by failing to provide any detail about the various schemes. Iain Duncan Smith has sought to brand our clients as 'job snobs', but in reality all they have been seeking is a system that is fair and transparent.\" After the ruling, Reilly said: \"I feel very proud that people seemed to have realised there was an injustice going on, and that we have carried it on and reached the verdict today. It's quite unbelievable. I'm still getting my head around it. But it is a great result.\" Reilly, a geology graduate from Birmingham, said the secretary of state needed to treat unemployed people with respect. \"Jobseekers \u2026 are just trying to make something of themselves, like anyone else,\" she said. \"We're not job snobs.\" She added that for job-seeking to be made harder by poor DWP regulations was a terrible irony. \"He [Duncan Smith] needs to realise they need to help us, not punish us,\" she said. The DWP said it was disappointed that the supreme court had agreed with the court of appeal. It said it had dealt with the matter after introducing emergency legislation in March. Despite the fact that the legislation was subject to judicial review proceedings, it was \"very confident\" of its validity and would \"defend it robustly\". Duncan Smith said: \"We have always said that it was ridiculous to claim that our schemes amounted to forced labour, and yet again we have won this argument.\" PIL said it would seek further legal action, and called on jobseekers to make claims against previous sanctions. \"We know that, like Jamie and Cait, hundreds of thousands of other jobseekers have not been, and continue not to be, provided with adequate information about the dizzying array of schemes,\" the lawyers said. \"Following today's judgment, any such jobseekers can object to sanctions that have been imposed and seek the repayment of their benefits. \"It is truly staggering that Duncan Smith has found himself in this position even after fast-tracking emergency retrospective legislation through parliament. We intend to work with advice organisations to ensure that, following this ruling, affected individuals have the right information and assistance.\" eEmployment minister Esther McVey said: \"All five judges unanimously said that the intention behind what we are doing is correct, mandation [mandating claimants into unpaid work] is correct. It is not what people have tried to say, it is slave labour. It is not at all. \"I'm pleased to say that the judges ruled on the side of common sense,\" she added.",

        "article": "American leaders have traditionally explained the foundations of the U.S.- relationship by citing shared democratic values and the moral responsibility America bears to protect the small nation-state of the Jewish people. Although accurate and essential, this characterization is incomplete because it fails to capture a third, crucial aspect: the many ways in which Israel advances U.S. national interests. Today, Israeli contributions to U.S. national interests cover a broad spectrum. Through joint training, exercises and exchanges on military doctrine, the United States has benefited in the areas of counter-terrorism, intelligence and experience in urban warfare. Increasingly, U.S. homeland security and military agencies are turning to Israeli technology to solve some of their most vexing technical and strategic problems. This support includes advice and expertise on behavioral screening techniques for airport security and acquisition of an Israeli-produced tactical radar system to enhance force protection. Israel has been a world leader in the development of unmanned aerial systems, both for intelligence collection and combat, and it has shared with the the technology, the doctrine and its experience regarding these systems. Israel is also a global pacesetter in armored vehicle protection, defense against short-range rockets, and the techniques and procedures of robotics, all of which it has shared with the United States. In missile defense, the United States has a broad and multifaceted partnership with Israel. Israel's national missile defenses \u2014 which include the U.S. deployment in Israel of an advanced X-band radar system and the more than 100 American military personnel who man it \u2014 will be an integral part of a larger missile defense spanning Europe, the eastern Mediterranean and the Persian Gulf to help protect U.S. forces and allies. Israeli-developed defense equipment, some of which benefited from generous U.S. aid, now used by the U.S. military include short-range unmanned aircraft systems that have seen service in ; targeting pods on hundreds of Air Force, Navy and Marine strike aircraft; a revolutionary helmet-mounted sight that is standard in nearly all frontline Air Force and Navy fighter aircraft; lifesaving armor installed in thousands of MRAP armored vehicles used in Iraq and Afghanistan; and a gun system for close-in defense of naval vessels against terrorist dinghies and small-boat swarms. Moreover, U.S. and Israeli companies are working together to produce Israel's Iron Dome \u2014 the world's first combat-proven counter-rocket system. Counter-terrorism and intelligence cooperation is deep and extensive, with the United States and Israel working to advance their common interest in defeating the terrorism of , Hezbollah and Al Qaeda and its affiliate groups, and preventing nuclear proliferation in the region. There are joint Special Forces training and exercises and collaboration on shared targets. This intimate relationship reinforces overall U.S. intelligence efforts by providing Washington with access to Israel's unique set of capabilities for information collection and assessments on key countries and issues in the region. Such was the case, for example, when Israel passed to the United States conclusive photographic evidence in 2007 that Syria, with North Korean assistance, had made enormous strides toward \"going hot\" with a plutonium-producing reactor. On important issues, the two nations do sometimes differ, a phenomenon not unique to the U.S.-Israel relationship. Over the decades, there have been periodic policy flare-ups, some even bitter, on topics ranging from Israel's preventive action against Iraq's nuclear reactor to Israeli sales of weaponry and military technology to China. Some of the most contentious disputes have been about actions affecting the Middle East peace process. But more often have been instances of U.S.-Israel collaboration \u2014 most important, the Arab-Israel peace treaties that are the anchor of American national interests in the Middle East. We do not deny that there are costs to the United States, in the Arab world and elsewhere, for its support of Israel, as there are costs to U.S. support of other beleaguered \u2014 and sometime imperfect \u2014 friends, including West Berlin in the Cold War, Kuwait in 1990-91 and Taiwan today. But the long-standing U.S. commitment to Israel has not prevented development of close ties with Arab nations, which understand \u2014 however much they disagree with U.S. support for Israel \u2014 that they benefit from a good relationship with the United States on other issues. Nor has it made the Arab oil-exporting states any less conscious of their own economic and strategic interest in a reasonably stable flow of oil to world markets, or their eagerness to buy first-class military equipment from the United States or to enjoy the benefits of U.S. protection against Iranian or other aggression. policies toward the United States, for example, be markedly different if Washington entered into a sustained crisis with Israel over the Palestine issue? Would Riyadh lower the price of oil? Would it stop hedging its regional bets concerning U.S. attempts to coerce into freezing its nuclear weapons programs? Would it regard current U.S. policy toward Afghanistan more positively? Would it view American democracy promotion in the Middle East more favorably? Would it be more inclined to reform its internal governmental processes to be more in line with U.S. preferences? No. In sum, we believe that Israel's substantial contributions to U.S. interests are an underappreciated aspect of this relationship and deserve equal billing to shared values and historical responsibility as rationales for American support of Israel.",

The cable giant and the YES Network, the television home for the Bronx Bombers, have not reached agreement on a new carriage deal for the channel. Now, YES-parent company 21st Century Fox is launching a multi-million dollar marketing campaign telling fans they need to change pay-TV distributors if they want to see the Yankees this year. Depending on the market, options for consumers could include providers such as DirecTV or Verizon Communication Inc.\u2019s FiOS. \u201cWe felt we had no choice but to let our customers know if they want to watch the Yankees they have to switch,\u201d said Tracy Dolgin, president and chief executive of YES. YES went dark on 900,000 Comcast homes in New Jersey and Connecticut last fall after the baseball season ended. Comcast said the price the network was seeking for a renewal was not justified by the channel\u2019s audience size. According to industry consulting firm SNL Kagan, the monthly subscription fee for YES is $5.36 per-subscriber. \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to evaluate whether there is a way to bring back YES under terms that are consistent to providing our customers with the best programming at the best price,\u201d a Comcast spokesman said. The dispute is a high-profile example of the rising tensions over the costs of sports TV content, particularly channels dedicated to particular teams or regions. Some consumers and pay TV executives blame sports channels for driving up the price of monthly cable bills. Sports network executives say their programming is among the most popular on television and is appealing to advertisers, because audiences watch it live. YES and 21st Century Fox officials say that neither price nor ratings were an issue, noting that Comcast had in fact been paying the agreed upon price for the channel last season as part of a temporary deal. Asked what the sticking points were with Comcast, Mr. Dolgin would only say the distributor wanted conditions that would have created a \u201cplaying field that would tilt in their direction.\u201d People familiar with the negotiations said the hurdle has to do with a so-called most-favored-nation clause in the proposed agreement. Typically such clauses protect a distributor such as Comcast if the programmer sells a channel to a rival at a lower price or allows greater flexibility in how a channel is distributed. In this case, the two sides are hung up on the language of the clause. Fox thinks the demands are too restrictive with regards to selling content to potential competitors while Comcast worries that it could end up being required to carry networks its customers don\u2019t want, the people said. 21st Century Fox, which owns 80% of the YES Network, and Wall Street Journal-owner News Corp were part of the same company until 2013.

        "article": "US prosecutors have vowed to make a fresh wave of arrests involving both \u201centities and individuals\u201d after new evidence emerged in their wide-ranging investigation into Fifa corruption. The Swiss authorities, moreover, have seized property in the Alps in relation to alleged money laundering. The Swiss attorney general, Michael Lauber, also confirmed a 2005 contract bearing the signature of Sepp Blatter that involved the sale of World Cup TV rights to the disgraced former Fifa official Jack Warner for a fraction of their true value is now part of the investigation. The contract threatens to drag the Fifa president, who has refused to travel to the US since the scandal broke, closer to the epicentre of the investigation. Neither Lynch nor Lauber would comment on which individuals or entities are under suspicion. Blatter has insisted he is \u201cclean\u201d, saying: \u201cI have my conscience and I know I\u2019m an honest man. I am clean. I am not a worried man.\u201d As Swiss and US authorities gave a joint update on their parallel investigations into what has been called \u201ca World Cup of fraud\u201d, the US attorney general, Loretta Lynch, said a new wave of arrests is looming. Fifa was thrown into crisis in May by dramatic arrests and indictments that alleged wide-ranging money laundering, racketeering and fraud. The arrests were made on the eve of Fifa\u2019s congress to re-elect Blatter as president. \u201cSeparate and apart from the pending indictment, our investigation remains active and ongoing. It has in fact expanded since May. The scope of our investigation is not limited and we are following the evidence where it leads,\u201d Lynch said at a press conference with Lauber in Zurich. \u201cWe do anticipate pursuing additional charges against individuals and entities.\u201d Asked whether those charged could include global federations such as Fifa and confederations such as the Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football (Concacaf) or the South American Football Confederation (Conmebol), Lynch said they could if offences took place under US jurisdiction but refused to comment further. \u201cIf they used the US financial system, we feel we would have the ability to charge them,\u201d said Lynch, who in May outlined the scale of the US department of justice charges against 14 individuals, including nine current or former Fifa executives. Lauber confirmed that among financial assets seized since 27 May were properties including apartments in the Swiss Alps and that 121 suspicious banking transactions are under investigation. It has seized 11 terabytes of data, equivalent to around 900m pages of information. \u201cHouse searches have been conducted in Switzerland and further evidence has been collected,\u201d Lauber said. \u201cWhere proportional and needed, financial assets have been seized, including real estate, for example flats in the Swiss Alps. At this point I would like to emphasise that investments in real estate can be misused for the purpose of money laundering.\u201d Swiss authorities are focusing their efforts on allegations concerning the awarding of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar, while US investigators continue their investigations into allegations of corruption against Fifa officials. Of the 14 Fifa officials indicted in May, 13 have been arrested of whom three have been charged in US courtrooms and 10 await extradition. Lynch confirmed she ideally wants to prosecute all 14 at the same time but pointed out that defendants could be tried in their absence. In the wake of the May arrests, Blatter was re-elected as Fifa president but promised to step down just five days later amid the spiralling crisis. He has promised to step down from the post in February 2016. Those charged include the former senior Fifa executives entwined with decades of controversy under Blatter, including Warner from Trinidad and Tobago, the former president of Concacaf, and the Paraguayan Nicol\u00e1s Leoz, and those who claimed to be part of a new wave of reformers, including Warner\u2019s replacement, Jeffrey Webb. Warner and Leoz have denied the charges against them while Webb has pleaded not guilty to federal racketeering and bribery charges. Blatter had anointed Webb, a former Fifa vice-president and the head of its anti-racism taskforce, who is on bail in the US, as his potential successor. Lynch warned that the US investigation that detailed a web of corruption, money laundering and racketeering mainly involving kickbacks on the sale of TV rights but also allegations of vote buying and bribery was far from over. \u201cAll individuals involved in soccer, through which we teach our children sportsmanship, integrity and the fundamentals of fair play, must be committed to reform and to compliance with the rule of law,\u201d she said. \u201cTo anyone who seeks to live in the past and return soccer to the days of corruption and bribery, cronyism and patronage this global response sends a strong message \u2013 you are on the wrong side of progress and you do a disservice to the integrity of this wonderful sport.\u201d Lauber refused to put a timescale on the Swiss investigation and implicitly criticised other jurisdictions for not doing enough to help. \u201cThis investigation will take much more than the legendary 90 minutes. Let me however assure you, that we are well aware of the public\u2019s interest in this investigation and have clearly prioritised based on the interests at stake, but clearly: we are not even near the half-time break,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are also looking for means to accelerate the procedure; in this context an additional challenge might be seen in the fact some of the information of interest to our criminal proceedings is under seal. It would be helpful if parties involved would cooperate more substantially.\u201d Lauber said Fifa\u2019s statement on Sunday night, which sought to explain the basis on which Warner was awarded TV rights to the 2010 and 2014 World Cups for a fraction of their true value, would be considered as part of the investigation. It said that under the terms of the agreement that \u201cFifa was to receive a fixed licensing fee as well as a 50% share of any profits related to the subcontracting of these rights. \u201cThe CFU [Caribbean Football Union] made several breaches to the contract and failed to meet its financial obligations. The obligations concerning the required pre-approval for subcontracting were not met either. For these reasons, Fifa terminated its contract with the CFU on 25 July 2011.\u201d The publication of the contract draws Blatter closer to the investigations and further calls into question his links with Warner, who served on Fifa\u2019s executive committee for 28 years. In her speech to fellow prosecutors, Lynch warned no one was beyond the law. \u201cWe made it abundantly clear once again that prosecutors around the world will stand together in order to root out corruption and bring wrongdoers to justice \u2013 no matter where they are, no matter how complex their crimes and no matter how powerful they may be,\u201d she said. \u201cOur message is clear: no individual is impervious to the law. No corrupt organisation is beyond its reach. And no criminal act can evade the concerted efforts of dedicated men and women fighting for justice.\u201d Related: Fifa corruption: Sepp Blatter blasts US authorities over investigation",

        "article": "Unicef and other aid organizations like Helen Keller International have been working frantically to distribute vitamin A capsules and iron and zinc supplements in poor countries, or to fortify foods with minerals and vitamins. But it\u2019s a long, hard slog. A vitamin A capsule costs only a couple of cents, but delivering the capsules to remote villages can cost as much as $1 each. So a decade ago scientists began experimenting with a different approach: What if they tinkered with crops so that they naturally contained iron, zinc or vitamin A? And that\u2019s where our hero, the sweet potato, comes in. Orange sweet potatoes on our Thanksgiving tables are full of beta carotene, which the body turns into vitamin A. But our sweet potatoes don\u2019t grow well in Africa. Africans eat an estimated seven million tons of sweet potatoes a year, but theirs are white ones that lack vitamin A. So scientists cross-bred sweet potatoes until they came up with vitamin A-rich orange varieties that grow well in Africa. Hard-bitten health specialists go weak-kneed over them. More than 170,000 Ugandan and Mozambiquan families are now growing these sweet potatoes. And the sweet potato is just the first of a number of crops that have been bred or engineered to address micronutrient deficiencies. This mix of agriculture and nutrition is called biofortification, and it\u2019s one of the hot words in the global poverty lexicon. Also in the works are rice and wheat packed with zinc, pearl millet and beans with iron, bright orange corn and golden cassava that give people vitamin A. These crops are all in various stages of testing by HarvestPlus, a nonprofit based in Washington. The alliance is financed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the World Bank, aid agencies from Canada, Britain and the United States, and the aim is to produce cheap seeds in the public domain. \u201cBiofortification is slow, but it has a huge impact in the end,\u201d said Howarth Bouis, director of HarvestPlus. One of the questions, though, is this: Will rural Africans want to eat orange sweet potatoes? Iron and zinc don\u2019t change the color or taste of foods, but foods that produce vitamin A are often an unearthly orange. While the crops backed by HarvestPlus are all conventionally bred, other crops have been genetically engineered. The best known is \u201cgolden rice\u201d: scientists plucked genes from daffodils and corn to come up with rice that produces vitamin A. Gerard Barry of the International Rice Research Institute said it is now in trials and, if widely accepted around the world, could be a huge step in reducing child deaths and blindness. \u201cIt has to be a game-changer,\u201d Dr. Barry said of biofortification. I met him at a conference in Washington on biofortification this month; also in attendance were scientists working on genetically engineered (and bright orange) bananas that provide vitamin A and on canola oil salad dressing that naturally brims with omega-3 fish oil. There are plenty of reasons to be skeptical. No battle against poverty goes smoothly, or as planned. And the European left\u2019s sad hostility to scientific tinkering with crops may slow acceptance of biofortification. If that hostility gains ground, it will be harder to save children from blindness and death. But, so far, the science is promising. It may turn out that one of the best ways to save children\u2019s lives, or to save women in childbirth, doesn\u2019t involve doctors but rather high-tech seeds. Children have been dying for lack of vitamin A, iron and zinc for thousands of generations. These new seeds may finally help end the scourge of starvation in this century, on our watch. And that\u2019s a special reason to give thanks.",

        "article": "CORVALLIS, Ore.\u2014Forget the cardboard cutouts of ghosts and goblins. Rich Bryan\u2019s yard this Halloween has pirate cannons, a breathing grave, animatronic apparitions and even a magic mirror\u2014all choreographed to perform a \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d styled show with lights, fog and music. \u201cHe pretty much eats, drinks and breathes Halloween,\u201d says Mr. Bryan\u2019s wife, Julie, as he recently put finishing touches on a display that is the talk of this college town, home to Oregon State University. Mr. Bryan, a 40-year-old theft-claims adjuster, is what is known as a \u201chaunter.\u201d That is the title embraced by Halloween lovers who adorn their homes with Hollywood-style light displays, lifelike corpses and other ostentation reminiscent of the high-wattage onslaught that overtook Christmas decorations. It is a growing subculture in many corners of America. And some neighbors are horrified. They complain the displays are gaudy, or way too graphic. In 2011, Kevin Judd tricked out his home in Riverside, Calif., with 2,000 LED lights including on giant electric pumpkin faces, synchronized to the LMFAO hit, \u201cParty Rock Anthem,\u201d which blared to throngs of onlookers out front. \u201cI just love Halloween,\u201d says Mr. Judd, 43, a fiber-optic technician. But he says some neighbors complained to their homeowner\u2019s association, which passed new rules that effectively pulled the plug on the Halloween show. Mr. Judd talked a family friend into hosting the show at her house nearby, which conveniently fronts a city park where people can put up lawn chairs. This year, it has 10,000 lights, a soundtrack that includes rapper Pitbull\u2019s \u201cFireball\u201d\u2014and blessing from city officials, who issued a permit for a street closure and pyrotechnics display. Still, there are many fans of extravagant Halloween decorations, including 11-year-old Sara Marston of Naperville, Ill. She started an online petition earlier this month to bring back one home\u2019s display, which had featured a cemetery with dozens of bodies emerging from the earth, after it was banned by a local homeowner\u2019s association. \u201cI absolutely hate that the neighbors are telling them not to do it!!\u201d the young horror fan wrote on her petition, which has garnered more than 10,000 signatures. Spooky displays are popping up in many neighborhoods, with the National Retail Federation projecting Americans will spend $1.9 billion on decorations for Halloween this year. But haunters are a special breed of Halloween enthusiasts. The Internet has enabled them to trade tips and admire each other\u2019s work in online forums. One common motivation for the hobby: getting to be more creative than at Christmas. \u201cOne of the differences I like about Halloween is there is no playbook,\u201d says Craig Tinder, a 39-year-old corporate portfolio director turned haunter from Huntersville, N.C., who has opted for a pirate theme this year, adorning his lawn with three 15-foot-tall sea monsters, an evil mermaid and talking pirates. \u201cFor Christmas, it is very structured.\u201d Many haunters tend to fall into two broad categories: ones who go for gruesomeness and ones who don\u2019t. Cory Doty, 45, goes for the former, through a \u201cchop shop\u201d he constructed in his Rochester, N.Y., garage where a cleaver-wielding skeleton stands over severed heads and other fake body parts. It is a far cry from the Winnie the Pooh Halloween theme the high-school teacher once used to entertain his two sons, now 17 and 15. \u201cI had no idea this was his passion,\u201d says his wife, Kim Doty, also 45. \u201cOne day he said, \u2018I can\u2019t wait until they get really old for Halloween.\u2019 I said, \u2018What do you mean?\u2019 He said, \u2018Really scary stuff.\u2019 \u201d But sometimes the thrills go too far. Eddie Pizzuto, 37, a golf shop worker in Los Angeles, used to hang from a porch ceiling in a full-body harness dressed as a witch\u2014calling out to startled trick-or-treaters. It was too much for some. \u201cSo I stopped doing that,\u201d says Mr. Pizzuto, who now grabs attention with a faux steam boiler whose door opens and closes. In Corvallis, a town of about 55,000 about 80 miles south of Portland, Mr. Bryan has spent the past decade honing his craft. He started by building a crypt with a flying marionette, and has now advanced to carving tombs with names of all Pac-12 opponents to his beloved Oregon State Beavers. Calling himself the \u201cGrim Beaver,\u201d he says on a website dedicated to the yard display that he \u201cpresides over a spooky graveyard filled with all enemies to Beaver Nation.\u201d In recent years, his yard has taken on a decided Disney DIS -1.13 % theme, as he has added replicas of Disneyland attractions including Pirates of the Caribbean and the Haunted Mansion. There is a gravedigger and a terrified dog\u2014built from rebar, building insulation and fake fur. \u201cIt took me two weeks to get the fur off my hands,\u201d Mr. Bryan says. This year, he added a replica of Ezra the hitchhiking ghost, which he made out of tubular steel wrapped in foam insulation. It wears a vinyl suit he sewed himself. The ghost, which he says cost about $1,500 to build, stands on a plywood stand, pivoting via a power torque engine with an electronic control board. In all, he has 106 extension cords powering his various displays. With about $15,000 invested in his displays, Mr. Bryan has rigged his yard with motion sensors and infrared cameras to alert him to any intruder. Neighbors mostly express support, though one expressed concern when it appeared his home had caught fire; he was just testing a fog machine. \u201cWe feel we should pay Rich,\u201d says neighbor Heidi Nevin, with two young children in tow. \u201cIt is a source of constant delight for our kids.\u201d Write to Jim Carlton at jim.carlton@wsj.com",

        "article": "updated 7:33 PM EST, Thu November 28, 2013 (CNN) -- It's a slice of life you don't often hear about. Shortly after a manager at a Pizza Hut franchise in Elkhart, Indiana, announced that he was fired for refusing to open on Thanksgiving Day, the company is offering him his job back. Tony Rohr, 28, had worked for the chain for more than 10 years. When he refused to open on Thanksgiving Day this year and force his employees to work, he says, he was told to write a letter of resignation. Instead, he wrote one explaining why the store should remain closed. \"I said, 'Why can't we be the company that stands up and says we care about your employees and you can have the day off?'\" Rohr told CNN affiliate WSBT Wednesday. \"Thanksgiving and Christmas are the only two days that they're closed in the whole year. And they're the only two days that those people are guaranteed to have off to spend with their families.\" Who wants to work on Thanksgiving? Rohr told the affiliate he refused to quit and detailed his frustration in the letter. \"I accept that the refusal to comply with this greedy, immoral request means the end of my tenure with this company,\" he says he wrote. \"I hope you realize that it is the people at the bottom of the totem pole that make your life possible.\" He was fired shortly after, he says. The local franchise told the affiliate that Rohr was not fired, but quit. Now, Pizza Hut's corporate office says the franchise \"made a serious error in judgment, one which we hope to help remedy.\" It sent CNN a statement that said the store has agreed to hire him back. \"We fully respect an employee's right to not work on a holiday, which is why the vast majority of Pizza Huts in America are closed on Thanksgiving,\" the corporate office said in a statement. \"As a result, we strongly recommended that the local franchisee reinstate the store manager and they have agreed. We look forward to them welcoming Tony back to the team.\" But Rohr, who was managing some 15 people when he departed, said Thursday that he was not sure he wanted to return to the team. \"That's something I can't decide right away,\" he told CNN in a telephone interview as he prepared to celebrate Thanksgiving with his family -- and without pizza. \"I'll start looking into stuff tomorrow.\" He said publicity about the story has spread. \"All my friends are telling me how cool it is and how proud they are -- 'You're my hero' and stuff you don't expect to hear,\" Rohr said. \"No, I'm just some guy who told his boss 'No' and got burned. There are people who save lives.\" CNN's Tom Watkins and Jose Lesh contributed to this report.",

        "article": "A Senate bill promoted as a surveillance reform would codify the ability of the National Security Agency to search its troves of foreign phone and email communications for Americans\u2019 information, and permit law enforcement agencies to search the vast databases as well. The Fisa Improvements Act, promoted by Dianne Feinstein, the California Democrat who chairs the Senate intelligence committee, would both make permanent a loophole permitting the NSA to search for Americans\u2019 identifying information without a warrant \u2013 and, civil libertarians fear, contains an ambiguity that might allow the FBI, the DEA and other law enforcement agencies to do the same thing. \u201cFor the first time, the statute would explicitly allow the government to proactively search through the NSA data troves of information without a warrant,\u201d said Michelle Richardson, the surveillance lobbyist for the ACLU. \u201cIt may also expand current practices by allowing law enforcement to directly access US person information that was nominally collected for foreign intelligence purposes. This fourth amendment back door needs to be closed, not written into stone.\u201d Feinstein\u2019s bill passed the committee on an 11 to 4 vote on 31 October. An expanded report on its provisions released by the committee this week added details about the ability of both intelligence and law enforcement to sift through foreign communications databases that it accumulates under section 702 of the Fisa Amendments Act of 2008. Section 6 of Feinstein\u2019s bill blesses what her committee colleague Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat and civil libertarian, has called the \u201cbackdoor search provision,\u201d which the Guardian revealed thanks to a leak by Edward Snowden. The section permits intelligence agencies to search \u201cthe contents of communications\u201d collected primarily overseas for identifying information on US citizens, resident aliens and people inside the US, provided that the \u201cpurpose of the query is to obtain foreign intelligence information or information necessary to understand foreign intelligence information or to assess its importance.\u201d Section 6 bills itself as a \u201crestriction,\u201d but it would not stop the NSA from performing the warrantless search, merely requiring intelligence agencies to log their queries and make them \u201cavailable for review\u201d to Congress, the Fisa court, the Justice Department and inspectors general inside the executive branch. Additionally, the report on Section 6 explicitly states that the provision \u201cdoes not limit the authority of law enforcement agencies to conduct queries of data acquired pursuant to Section 702 of Fisa for law enforcement purposes.\u201d There is ambiguity surrounding whether the FBI can currently search through the NSA\u2019s foreign communications databases, or is reliant on the NSA to pass on information from the databases relevant to the bureau. A declassified Fisa court document from 2011 refers to \u201cFBI minimization procedures,\u201d but it is unclear what those procedures are. A copy of the FBI minimization procedures from 2009, acquired by the ACLU under the Freedom of Information Act is almost completely redacted. So is the section in the government\u2019s most recent report on its Section 702 collection dealing with the FBI\u2019s role, though it contains references to how the FBI \u201creceive[s] \u2026 unminimized Section 70 acquired communications\u201d from the NSA. Feinstein\u2019s bill \u201cseems to imply there is currently some authority for law enforcement to query the database, which [intelligence community] officials have not mentioned in any of their remarks on Section 702,\u201d said Alan Butler, an attorney with the Electronic Privacy Information Center. The provision is also unclear about whether law enforcement agencies can search through the foreign communications databases for information on US persons. Feinstein\u2019s office did not respond to a request for clarification by deadline. The ambiguity concerns civil libertarians, as it opens a door for law enforcement agencies to sidestep warrant requirements. \u201cIf Senator Feinstein or other congressional supporters of this bill believe that it would in fact expand law enforcement access to the database, that would be an unjustified expansion of surveillance over Americans,\u201d Butler said. \u201cIntelligence community leaders and those in charge of the congressional oversight committees have stressed many times that Section 702 is supposed to be about collecting foreign communications, and the law should make clear that is so.\u201d The surveillance blogger Marcy Wheeler first noticed the controversial provisions, and highlighted another on Thursday: the bill would permit contractors access to the NSA\u2019s foreign communications databases. \u201cThe committee believes that, to the greatest extent practicable, all queries conducted pursuant to the authorities established under this section should be performed by federal employees,\u201d according to the bill. \"Nonetheless, the committee acknowledges that it may be necessary in some cases to use contractors to perform such queries. By using the term \u2018government personnel\u2019 the committee does not intend to prohibit such contractor use.\u201d Wyden has sounded vague warnings about the existing \u201cbackdoor search\u201d provision, and said in a statement released by the committee that the Feinstein bill \u201cwould give intelligence agencies wide latitude to conduct warrantless searches for Americans\u2019 phone calls and emails under Section 702.\u201d The statement was joined by Mark Udall, a Colorado Democrat, and Martin Heinrich, a New Mexico Democrat. Feinstein\u2019s bill is a direct competitor to a different surveillance bill in the Senate taken up by the judiciary committee. Sponsored by the committee\u2019s chairman, Vermont Democrat Pat Leahy, and supported by Wyden and Udall, the bill would require a warrant to search of any NSA foreign communications database for any specific US person information.",

        "article": "Lots of MBA programs promise to prepare the next generation of entrepreneurs and business elites\u2014for about $40,000 in annual tuition. Shai Reshef says he can do the same for a lot less. After selling his education company to Kaplan, Inc., the New York-based entrepreneur in 2009 plowed the proceeds into offering tuition-free college degrees. Since then, his Pasadena-based University of the People has enrolled 3,500 students from across the world in bachelor degrees in business administration and computer science, taught online in small, intensive classes. Now Reshef has gone a step further, with what he claims is the world\u2019s first almost-free MBA, beginning in September. To sit all 12 exams, students will pay just $2,400\u2014a tiny, tiny fraction of what students pay at physical schools. And there are scholarships for those who cannot afford that, with HP hpe and Microsoft msft among the donors. Courtesy of University of the People While companies often regard online degrees skeptically, Reshef insists UoPeople, accredited by the Distance Education Accrediting Commission in Washington, is little different in quality from bricks-and-mortar competitors, which anyway post some of their course literature online. And, he says, it attracts students who otherwise struggle to launch professional careers\u2014a hot issue in the US presidential race, where crippling student debt is fueling voter anger. \u201cWhen you educate one person you can change one life,\u201d Reshef says. \u201cWhen you educate a lot of people, you can change the world.\u201d For more on MBAs, watch this Fortune video: Many academics are convinced. \u201cHere is an opportunity to have an impact on people and their local economies that I would not normally get teaching top MBAs,\u201d says Russell Winer, marketing professor at NYU\u2019s Stern School of Business, who heads UoPeople\u2019s business education. \u201cThere is excess demand for this kind of program.\u201d Indeed, UoPeople\u2019s MBA has attracted 4,400 applicants for about 1,500 spots during the first year, about 20 percent of them Americans and one-quarter from Africa\u2014many eyeing better-paid jobs. \u201cI want a managerial position,\u201d says Debbie Time, a health-insurance analyst in Orlando, Fla. \u201cWith a Bachelor\u2019s I cannot get there.\u201d Such limitations are unnecessary, Reshef says. \u201cOur model shows higher education can be sustainable, inexpensive and still high quality,\u201d he says. \u201cOthers can do the same.\u201d A version of this article appears in the June 1, 2016 issue of Fortune with the headline \u201cMaking a Really (Really) Cheap MBA.\u201d",

        "article": "For millions of people, colds, flu and blocked noses are a standard seasonal misery. Shared office space, air-conditioning and public transport quickly double as breeding grounds for germs, making it near-impossible to avoid infection. But, according to medical insiders, sniffling through silly season doesn\u2019t need to be your destiny. Here, a team of health experts reveal their top tips for boosting your immune system and potentially escaping autumn/winter unscathed \u2013 offering an alternative to drugs and jabs. Changing the temperature of your morning shower can strengthen your body\u2019s defences. This simple-but-effective tactic triggers the body\u2019s own immunity-building process, keeping you fit as well as fresh. Shona Wilkinson, nutritonist at Superfooduk.com says: \u201cA simple way to change your existing routine is to change the temperature of the water to either hot or cold every two minutes. \u201cThis works by increasing two types of white blood cells called monocytes and lymphocytes. \u201cThe immune system is stimulated by your body trying to warm itself up from the cold water, while switching to hot water every now and then stimulates your body\u2019s detoxification system. \u201cThe fewer toxins we have in our body, the more your immune system is better able to deal with bacteria and viruses.\u201d As if we needed any excuse to have more sex, turns out it has added health benefits, too. In addition to being rather energetic exercise \u2013 which is always a winner when it comes to well-being \u2013 there\u2019s proof it correlates with the body\u2019s defences. Cassandra Barns, Nutritonist explains: \u201cThere is a link between how much sex you have and how many sick days you take at work. \u201cRegular sex increases the number of IgA immune cells in your blood, keeping colds and flu in check.\u201d When it comes to avoiding infection, common sense would suggest keeping your distance from other people. But, actually, it seems that the reverse is true. This is because physical contact sparks a chemical reaction in the brain which has follow-on benefits in our bodies. \u201cA rub, a hug, and a passing touch all decrease the level of the stress hormone cortisol in your body,\u201d adds Shona. \u201cCortisol decreases your immune response, so snuggle up to a loved one and enjoy the immune boosting properties of an embrace!\u201d From Halloween and Bonfire Night to the obligatory office Christmas bash, autumn/winter is \u2013 without a doubt \u2013 party season. However, while it runs counter-intuitive to our idea of staying healthy, socialising can actually help us side-step infection. Contrary to logical thinking about the spread of colds and flu, research has proven that spending time with friends and family is a great way to decrease your chance of catching a cold. \u201cThis is because, after socialising, your immune system works better,\u201d says Wilkinson. Who knew that Justin Bieber and Kylie Minogue could be your first-line of defence in a cold war? Research tells us that because music triggers the feel-good chemicals in our system, it keeps listeners in in fine fettle. Barns explains: \u201cSoothing yourself with music, whatever your tastes may be, activates the same part of the brain as sex and food. This increases the amount of Natural Killer immune cells in your blood.\u201d Better still, is making your own music. Musicians have even higher amounts of immune cells. It\u2019s the exercise of choice for celebrities such as Gwyneth Paltrow and Jennifer Anniston. Yet, despite being trendier than your average treadmill, meditation and yoga strengthens resistance as well as muscle tone. \u201cIt works to increase immunity in two ways. Firstly it decreases the stress hormone cortisol, which has an immune-suppressing affect, and secondly, they have been shown to increase the electrical activity in the emotional part of your brain, which also command your immune system what to do,\u201d explains Shona. Some stress is good for us. But long office hours, endless emails and that tricky work/life balance mean we can easily push ourselves too far. Hence why relaxing shouldn\u2019t be underestimated when it comes to maintaining a healthy mind and body. Why? Because stress hampers our ability to fight infection by making immune cells less sensitive to stimuli. As if that wasn\u2019t enough, Sheldon Cohen, Ph.D., a psychology professor at Carnegie Mellon University, also found that chronic stress lasting more than a month doubles the risk of catching a cold. It may sound barking mad, but canine companions aren\u2019t just good company \u2013 they also boost our body\u2019s in-built defence system. Whatever the breed, studies suggest that dog-owners enjoy a significant increase in the immune cell IgA after petting their beloved pet pooches. Don\u2019t worry, though \u2013 if you\u2019re not a dog person, try it out on your cat instead. Spend the day chained to your desk? Then it\u2019s probably time to get out and connect with life outside the office. See, studies show that people who spend more time in parks and forests exhibit an increased function of the immune system. \u201cThere are certain chemicals that plants omit into the air called phytoncides designed to protect plants from insects and from rotting, it also has a positive effect on human immune systems,\u201d explains Shona. There never seems to be enough hours in the day. But, according to Dr Marilyn Glenville, that\u2019s still no excuse to try and compensate by sleeping less \u2013 which is precisely what we\u2019ve been doing for the past 100 years. \u201cAs a society we are sleeping less; the time we sleep each night has reduced from 9 hours to 7.5 hours since the 1900s,\u201d she says. Sleep is important for your health because it gives your body time to recharge its batteries and repair cells and tissue. A recent study showed that missing even a few hours a night on a regular basis can decrease the number of \u2018natural killer cells\u2019, which are responsible for fighting off invaders such as bacteria and viruses. \u201cThis will come as no surprise to those of us who succumb to colds and other illnesses when we are run down \u2013 normally after periods of inadequate sleep.\u201d",

        "article": "If you smoke or you're overweight, have high cholesterol or high blood pressure, you could be forced to pay a lot more for health insurance, according to new regulations just issued by the Obama administration. \"For smoking, for being overweight, for being obese and basically, for generally not meeting the health guidelines, the employer can charge 30 percent more - for smoking, 50 percent more,\" explains John Goodman, President of the National Center for Policy Analysis in Dallas. ObamaCare does prevent insurers from charging more for pre-existing conditions, or from charging as much as they currently do for older people who use more health care. But when it comes to smoking and being overweight as well as other health problems, if employees don't participate in wellness programs, they could pay more. Ed Haislmeier of the Heritage Foundation says \"on the one hand they're trying to ban discrimination based on health status, but on the other hand they're trying to say that some discrimination based on health status is good discrimination.\" Goodman adds that \"it is definitely the nanny state trying to tell us what we're going to do, and unleashing the employers to be the agent of the government in telling us what we're going to do.\" Smokers, of course, run up more health care bills than non-smokers. But that habit and some other unhealthy conditions are associated with lower incomes, so higher rates would hit those the administration was aiming to help. \"Allowing premium differentials based on these factors will push premiums higher primarily on people that will be struggling to pay the premiums in the first place,\" says Jim Capretta of the Ethics and Public Policy Center. Many employers already offer wellness programs, but the new 123-page regulation tells them exactly how they must operate. \"This is just one more massive regulation on top of the thousands and thousands of pages that have already been issued that employers have to deal with,\" says Capretta. \"I think the whole system is starting to choke on so many rules.\" Ironically, on the day officials released the new regulations, a Rand Corporation study about wellness programs was released \u2013 and not with good news. Goodman noted it was \"a Rand Corporation study, which was paid for by the Obama administration, and called for in the affordable care act. \"And the Rand Corporation has studied wellness programs all over the country, and basically says they don't work.\" In fact, the study found that those trying to lose weight in these programs lost an average of a pound a year. And although some employers offer gym memberships, those who take them are the ones using the gym already -- not those who need it most.",

        "article": "We often hear lamentations about declining educational quality, but the focus is usually misplaced on SAT scores and graduation rates. Missing from the conversation is the quality of what\u2019s being taught. Meanwhile, we are mistakenly wed to the notion that more people going to college means more people will find jobs. Obviously the weak economy is a factor in the highest unemployment rate for those ages 16 to 29 since World War II. But there\u2019s more to the story. Fundamentally, students aren\u2019t learning what they need to compete for the jobs that do exist. These facts have been well documented by a variety of sources, not to mention the common experience of employers who can\u2019t find applicants who can express themselves grammatically. A 2010 study published by the Association of American Colleges and Universities found that 87 percent of employers believe that higher-education institutions have to raise student achievement if the United States is to be competitive in the global market. Sixty-three percent say that recent college grads don\u2019t have the skills they need to succeed. And, according to a separate survey, more than a quarter of employers say entry-level writing skills are deficient. One of the most damning indictments of higher education came this year with a book, \u201cAcademically Adrift: Limited Learning on College Campuses,\u201d by Richard Arum of New York University and Josipa Roksa of the University of Virginia. It\u2019s a dense tome that could put Ambien out of business, but the authors\u2019 findings are compelling. Just two examples: \u25cfGains in critical thinking, complex reasoning and writing skills are either \u201cexceedingly small or nonexistent for a larger proportion of students.\u201d \u25cfThirty-six percent of students experience no significant improvement in learning (as measured by the Collegiate Learning Assessment) over four years of higher education. Undoubtedly, critics of Arum and Roksa will find reason to diminish their findings. But Americans know that something is wrong with higher education, and the consensus is growing that young adults aren\u2019t being taught the basic skills that lead to critical thinking. Most universities don\u2019t require the courses considered core educational subjects \u2014 math, science, foreign languages at the intermediate level, U.S government or history, composition, literature, and economics. The nonprofit American Council of Trustees and Alumni (ACTA) has rated schools according to how many of the core subjects are required. A review of more than 1,000 colleges and universities found that 29 percent of schools require two or fewer subjects. Only 5 percent require economics. Less than 20 percent require U.S. government or history. Critics of ACTA\u2019s findings insist that the core curriculum is outdated and accuse the organization of being \u201cconservative.\u201d (Founders included Lynne Cheney and Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman.) Some also insist that such \u201cold-fashioned\u201d curricula merely encourage memorization and rote learning rather than critical thinking. Ridiculous, says ACTA President Anne Neal: \u201cHow can one think critically about anything if one does not have a foundation of skills and knowledge? It\u2019s like suggesting that our future leaders only need to go to Wikipedia to determine the direction of our country.\u201d College students may be undereducated, but they\u2019re not dumb and many feel short-changed. A recent Roper Organization study found that nearly half of recent graduates don\u2019t think they got their money\u2019s worth. The problem with education isn\u2019t money \u2014 we spend plenty \u2014 but quality. Yet, instead of figuring out how to make education pay future dividends, higher-educational institutions are building better dorms with flat-screen TVs, movie theaters and tanning salons, according to a recent CNN report. If parents aren\u2019t furious, they\u2019re not paying attention. In the lost spirit of in loco parentis, Neal and Arum have teamed up to take these findings to those upon whom ultimate responsibility falls: the nation\u2019s 10,000 college and university trustees. In a letter sent a few weeks ago, Arum wrote that institutions not demanding a rigorous curriculum \u201care actively contributing to the degradation of teaching and learning. They are putting these students and our country\u2019s future at risk.\u201d That\u2019s a provocative charge and a call to arms. Let\u2019s hope trustees hear it and heed.",

        "article": "Most royals may have to be a bit thriftier this year as fortunes plummet, but it's not so for the King of Morocco, Mohammed VI, whose 12 palaces reportedly cost $1 million a day to operate. His net worth is up $1 billion this year to $2.5 billion, making him the only one of the world's 15 richest royals to have added to his fortune in the past year. His savior is his country's near monopoly of the commodity Phosphate. A key component of fertilizer, phosphorous, mined in the form of phosphate rock, is essential to global food production. \"You cannot survive without phosphate--every cell on your body depends on it,\" says Michael Lloyd, research director at the Florida Institute of Phosphate Research. Morocco controls to nearly half the world's phosphate deposits. Last year, the North African nation mined 28 million metric tons of phosphate rock, making it the third-largest producer in the world, behind China and the U.S., and the single biggest supplier. Proceeds from phosphate mining make up roughly half the country's revenues. It is a profitable business. The state-owned phosphate monopoly, Office Cherifien des Phosphates (OCP) raked in an estimated $2.8 billion in net profit last year, a ninefold increase from the prior year, thanks to a surge in phosphate prices, which hit an all-time high of $500 per ton in July 2008, five times the 2007 average and more than 12 times the 2006 average. The king himself rarely talks about phosphates, preferring instead to focus on socially progressive issues like women's rights and standard of living. He created a new family law granting women more power and recently launched a $6 billion initiative to build housing for Morocco's urban poor. But he does get a portion of the profits and almost certainly has a hand in the OCP's business, particularly its admitted use of \"dominance\" in influencing phosphate's price spike. \"That's one thing you have to face: The Moroccan fertilizer industry is run by the government,\" says Lloyd. \"In the 1970s you could get phosphate for $4. Then one day they just decided to raise the price to $20.\" Another analyst blamed last year's high prices on the OCP's maneuvers, though soaring agricultural demand and tightening supplies were certainly factors as well. So far this year, recessionary pressures have pushed prices back below $200, but still enough for the King Mohammed VI to move up one notch to No. 7 among the world's richest royals. (See our full list of the top 15 here.) The Moroccan monarch who took over from his late father Hassan II in 1999 and is only 45 years old could climb much higher in the ranks, thanks to the scarcity of his precious rocks. Though phosphate occurs naturally in soil, the world's growing, hungry population requires more than Mother Nature provides. The U.S. expects to exhaust its reserves within the next 40 years. Already, two of the leading U.S. fertilizer firms, Mississippi Phosphates and Agrifos Fertilizer, procure their phosphate rock from OCP. Morocco's reserves, the most extensive in the world, will be tapped out within the next century. There are also political threats. Although Morocco under King Mohammed VI is overall fairly peaceful and pro-Western, about one-sixth of its phosphate hails from the Western Sahara territory. Morocco annexed the 100,000-square-mile former Spanish colony in 1975 despite competing claims to the region by Mauritania and an Algerian-backed independence movement. Ongoing guerrilla warfare between Moroccans and the pro-independence nationalists ended after a U.N.-brokered ceasefire in 1991, but the region is still considered an occupied territory. Morocco's plan to expand phosphate production in the region has come under fire from human rights activists and prompted nationalists' threats to breach the ceasefire. And activists aren't the only ones who should be concerned about turmoil in the resource-rich region: No more phosphate means no more fertilizer, a dire problem for global food production. But unlike oil, which has substitutes like biodiesel or propane, \"there is no alternative to phosphorous,\" says David Vaccari, an engineering professor at Stevens Institute of Technology. He calls the impending phosphate shortage \"the sleeper issue of our time.\"",

        "article": "Commercial banks across the country have absorbed the greatest share of the billions of dollars that have poured into NOW accounts since the beginning of the year. By March 18, NOW accounts at commercial banks totaled $36.6 billion, or more than six times the $6 billion held by savings banks and savings and loan associations, according to preliminary figures compiled by the Federal Reserve Board. The commercial banks, however, appear to have harvested these deposits at considerable cost to their balance sheets, for most of the NOW money, in checking accounts on which banks pay interest, appears to have come from what had been no-interest accounts in the same institutions. Costs to the Banks ''These accounts are costing us $55 million a year,'' complained Robert Thaler, senior vice president of the Security Pacific National Bank in Los Angeles. NOW accounts, or negotiable orders of withdrawal, became available nationwide on Jan. 1 as a result of a bill passed by Congress last spring. In some regions, however, the advantage to the consumer of being paid interest on his checking account has been offset: A number of banks sharply increased service charges and minimum balance requirements to cover in part the interest they pay on NOW accounts. For example, in preparation for the introduction of the accounts, the 87 banks owned by the Northwest Bancorporation of Minneapolis have increased their service charges, a combination of fees and minimum balances, by about 25 percent a year over the past three years, according to Thomas E. Dolan, vice president. Little Effect on Thrift Units The poor showing of the savings institutions in attracting NOW funds was anticipated, analysts said. And few thrift industry leaders had expected NOW accounts to solve - or even have a big effect on - their basic problem of having to pay high rates for funds to finance low-yielding mortgages. ''NOW accounts are not significant for the thrifts in terms of dollars,'' says Bruce A. Bigbee, a partner in Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co., the accounting firm. But, he continued, ''these accounts are important because they give the thrifts the ability to provide full banking services.'' Peat, Marwick has been advising savings institutions on how to put their expanded powers into effect. More importantly, officials at savings institutions say, NOW accounts induce some depositors to do all their banking at the thrift units, since they no longer must go to commercial banks for checking accounts. This appears to have been the case in New England, New York and New Jersey, where for several years savings institutions have been allowed to offer NOW accounts. Management Changes Urged Some thrift industry analysts, such as Mr. Bigbee, believe that NOW accounts could be more important to the thrift units if their managements could change their approach. Many, for example, are unwilling to give immediate credit to payroll checks that are deposited in NOW accounts. As a result, many customers have been surprised to find that their own checks have bounced. ''Thrifts typically wait five to seven days to clear in-city checks, and as long as three weeks to clear checks drawn on banks outside their own cities,'' Mr. Bigbee says. ''There's a lot they've got to learn.'' A number of leading thrift officials themselves are not enthusiastic about NOW accounts. ''It's not something I was fighting for,'' says Richard H. Diehl, chairman of the Home Savings and Loan Association, the biggest in the nation. ''We're not trying to become a bank; I'm pleased the NOW accounts have come out as well as they have.'' 'Marginally Profitable' Mr. Diehl said that as of April 1, Home Savings had $101.6 million in NOW accounts; he had hoped to reach that level by midyear. Taking into consideration the costs involved, Mr. Diehl estimates that the real cost of handling NOW accounts, including the 5 1/4 percent interest paid, is about 10 1/4 percent. ''This is why we felt it would be marginally profitable,'' he said. ''NOW accounts will never be a significant portion of the total assets of savings and loan associations,'' predicted Lamar Brantley, an economist with the United States League of Savings Associations, the trade group for the savings and loan industry. Even if the thrift institutions are getting only a small part of the NOW business, however, it was their entry into the checkingaccount field that convinced many commercial banks to market NOW accounts aggressively. Initial Reluctance Most commercial banks had been extremely reluctant to start paying interest on checking deposits, even though they have had the power to do so since November 1978. At that time, they were permitted to offer automatic-transfersystem accounts. With these A.T.S. accounts, banks could automatically move funds from an interest-paying savings account into a checking account when money was needed in that account. Although, technically, they were not paying interest on checking accounts, the effect was the same. Because thrift units still were not permitted to offer checking accounts, A.T.S. accounts were not available to them. Without the threat of competition from the savings banks, few commercial banks were eager to push the more costly interest-bearing A.T.S. accounts. That attitude changed dramatically last year, when Congress passed a law that permitted nationwide NOW accounts for both thrift units and savings banks, effective last Jan.1. Push for Customers In response to an expected push by the thrift industry for checking account customers, some commercial banks jumped the gun and began marketing A.T.S. accounts heavily in the fall of 1980. This was the case at Security Pacific, which started an intensive marketing campaign for its A.T.S. accounts in September. Since then, it has signed up more than 130,000 accounts, totaling more than $500 million. Northwest Bancorporation started its marketing campaign in November. ''The results have been encouraging,'' said Mr. Dolan, the vice president. He says Northwest banks account for 31 percent of the NOW accounts in the seven-state Minneapolis Federal Reserve District; savings and loan associations account for only about 4 percent. ''It's sort of what we had hoped to achieve,'' he said. Illustrations: Graph of now accounts ACCOUNTS",

        "article": "Co.is bringing back the storied Datsun brand, but American drivers are unlikely to see any new vehicles adorned with the name whose popularity in Southern California served as a springboard to international prominence. Nissan is positioning Datsun as a lower-cost brand in emerging markets. The new line will go on sale in India, Indonesia and Russia in 2014. The Datsun brand dates from 1931 as the nameplate of \u2019s DAT Motorcar Co., which was purchased by Nissan in 1933. The car was first known as a Datson, and later changed to Datsun. The marque grew to a success by featuring well engineered, sporty cars such as the 240Z and Datsun 510 sedan in the United States. Much of that growth is attributed to Yutaka Katayama, the auto marketing guru who spearheaded Nissan\u2019s launch into the American car market. Katayama, who is 102, worked in a variety of marketing jobs before being exiled by senior management in 1960 to what looked like a dead-end position in the United States because of his opposition to a company-backed union. At the time Nissan had sold barely 1,000 vehicles in the United States under the Datsun brand name through independent distributors. Katayama, known as a savvy marketer and enthusiastic gearhead, turned the company into a household name. The Japanese executive started with an ad budget of just $1,000, one engineer and an office clerk, wrote author David Halberstam, who chronicled Katayama\u2019s story in \u201cThe Reckoning,\u201d his 1986 book on the auto industry. The first Datsun office was in an old Mobil oil building in downtown Los Angeles. Katayama later moved it to Gardena, where there was a large Japanese American population that he believed might be more accepting than other consumers of products from their ancestral country. It turned out that they liked the American cars of the time better. Katayama was among the first Japanese auto executives to understand that foreign cars had to be customized for the American market. He understood that the initial Datsuns were underpowered and unrefined and nagged the home office for improvements such as bigger engines, better fit and finish and improved brakes. His badgering paid off in 1968, when the new Datsun 510 models arrived at the Port of Los Angeles. The 510 was a small, durable four-door sedan that performed well and sold for a price -- about $1,800 -- that was within nearly everyone's reach. Automotive buffs compared the car favorably to the BMW 1600, a German-made sedan that sold for about $5,000 at the time. The 510 powered Datsun to a sales boom, especially in import-friendly California. U.S. growth turned Nissan into an international automotive powerhouse. In 1981, Nissan decided to phase out the Datsun name. The company wanted to sell all its cars under the same name, no matter the market. But that strategy lasted only a few years until Nissan launched its Infiniti luxury division in 1989. Now it makes sense to establish a third brand to sell in developing markets, said Aaron Bragman, an analyst with IHS Automotive. \u201cWhat this does is safeguard the Nissan and Infiniti brands,\u201d Bragman said. The new Datsuns will be small, inexpensive cars without the power and amenities of Nissan\u2019s other brands. To sell such vehicles under the Nissan name could hurt the reputation of the parent brand, he said. General Motors Co. has taken the same approach in China to protect its Chevrolet and Buick nameplates by partnering with Liuzhou Wuling Motors Co. to sell vehicles under Baojun brand name that can compete with the small, inexpensive cars sold for the mass market there, Bragman said. He doesn\u2019t expect American consumers to pine for a new Datsun, except perhaps for a few diehard 240Z fans in Southern California. \u201cThe name has been gone so long it doesn\u2019t carry any huge nostalgia,\u201d he said.",

        "article": "Album leaks are not exactly uncommon nowadays, but the Internet is humming this afternoon with talk of Kanye West\u2019s upcoming disc, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, which oozed online today, weeks before its November 22 drop date. According to All Hip Hop, the album is now available on the web (we\u2019re not going to tell you where, just GoogleGoogle it) \u2014 but in an edited, clean version. So even if fans are able to snag the tunes today, they\u2019re most likely going to have to wait for the full effect (or another leak). Kanye is no stranger to leaks. According to MTV, he suspended his G.O.O.D. Fridays series (in which he will give away a free, new song every Friday on his blogblog) for a week after the Bon Iver-sampling \u201cLost in the World\u201d from My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy leaked. \u201cDue to blogs leaking unfinished songs from my actual album I\u2019ve decided to pass of Good Fridays this week,\u201d West said in a tweet. \u201cIt\u2019s messed up that one hacker can mess everything up for everyone\u2026 I love to take a year to finish my songs and deliver them to you guys in there most completed form\u2026 It would have seemed like since I give free music every week even the lowest form of human being would respect that enough not to leak unfinished songs from my real album\u2026\u201d Although it seems like a leak would kill a record (You have the music for free, why buy it? Or the music is poor quality and people get turned off) the effects are more nuanced than that. I spoke to Adam Farrell, head of marketing for Beggars Group, after The National\u2019s album, High Violet, leaked, and he told me, \u201cA leak hurts a bad record, really. I\u2019ve not really seen it hurt a really good record.\u201d After The National\u2019s disc hit the web, for instance, the band got creative, premiering a high-quality, advance stream of the disc on The New York Times\u2019s website. Add to that a Vevo livestream, and the band nabbed the number three spot on the Billboard Top 200 chart after one week of sales. We\u2019re not saying the leak helped sales in the case of The National, but it didn\u2019t kill the band members\u2019 careers either. Well, judging from the reactions around the web at present, Kanye\u2019s career is safe as well. Fans seem to be raving. (The five-star review on Rolling Stone didn\u2019t hurt, either.) Twitter is abuzz with folks commending the rapper on his new disc and feverishly looking for downloads, and some bloggers are even writing glowing live blogs of the leak. The Village Voice, for its part, has written a rather amusing piece depicting how Kanye could possibly react to the thievery of his new jams (all CAPs rant, or \u201cImma let you finish\u2026\u201d real talk). West, however, has so far failed to say anything outright about the album going wide early, save to retweeting some of his fans\u2019 glowing reviews, which, to us, reflects something Trent Reznor once said: \u201cI felt furious when the record I\u2019d worked on for a year, that my heart and soul\u2019s gone into, [leaked]. I\u2019m pissed off at people that are listening to it. I\u2019m mad that they\u2019re snubbing me \u2014 by what? By being excited about hearing my music? And that\u2019s wrong. I shouldn\u2019t be mad at these people. I should be glad that people are interested.\u201d We\u2019ll see what his reaction is in coming days, however, and what effect this leak (if any) has on sales.

Jonze (\u201cBeing John Malkovich,\u201d \u201cAdaptation\u201d) is a master at transforming genres, and with \u201cHer,\u201d he renders formulaic romantic dramedies instantly obsolete. His progressive approach makes sense, given that the film\u2019s true subject is evolution \u2014 how we change within relationships, throughout society, and inside ourselves. Jonze sets the film in a not-very-distant future where technology has played a role in detaching humans from each other. The movie\u2019s depressed hero, Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix), is a prime example. Separated from his wife, Theodore works as a computer-age Cyrano, crafting seemingly personal letters for strangers to send to their loved ones. Outside his high-tech office, however, Theodore is almost entirely alone in the world. And then he buys a new operating system for his computer. As Jonze envisions it, each OS \u2014 clearly modeled on Apple\u2019s Siri \u2014 has its own distinct personality. Theodore\u2019s OS is named Samantha (she\u2019s articulated, perfectly, by Scarlett Johansson), and she can\u2019t wait to learn everything imaginable. Though he is made of flesh and blood, and she is a voice that emanates from a machine, they build a flirty, confidential rapport that eventually deepens into true romance. Theodore is initially embarrassed by the fact that his girlfriend doesn\u2019t actually possess a body, and there are some \u2014 including his ex-wife, Catherine (Rooney Mara) \u2014 who mock him for his relationship. But his equally lonely friend Amy (a poignant Amy Adams), whose own BFF is an OS, totally gets it. And anyway, what does it matter? Theodore is happy for the first time in years, because finally, it seems, he\u2019s found The One. Together, he and Samantha figure out how to vacation together, learn together and grow, both as individuals and a couple. (Yes, they also figure out how to take phone sex to the next level.) From \u201cMetropolis\u201d to \u201c2001,\u201d most cultural observers have seen alienation in the development of the technological era. In contrast, Jonze envisions thrilling, exalted potential. He builds this excitement through kinetic cinematography, ingenious plotting, striking revelations and, especially, the entirely believable ties between two characters who never even see each another. Our need to bond runs so deep, Jonze suggests, that \u2014 just like love \u2014 technology can be used as a medium for expansion rather than limitation. And just like love, the movie can be experienced from vastly different perspectives. Some viewers will read Jonze\u2019s ending as a celebration of all that can be achieved between two like-minded souls. Others will be left wondering whether relationships must inevitably weaken as partners grow and change. Will you relate more to the bitter, or embrace the sweet? The choice itself is Jonze\u2019s ultimate gift to us: an invitation to leave his film ready to communicate, debate and, most crucially of all, connect.",

        "article": "Steve Jobs and his greatest invention, the iPhone - Wikipedia It was an active day in Apple world on Tuesday, with analyst upgrades, market share reports, and a tear down of the new CDMA iPhone that rattled the chip world. Apple\u2019s iPhone continues to move the market, as the company co-founded by Steve Jobs marches on, closing the market cap gap with the world\u2019s largest company, Exxon Mobil. A website advocating gadget self repair, iFixit, published its \u201ctear down\u201d of the CDMA iPhone4, designed to run on a Verizon network. As the internal components came to light, the markets automatically picked winners and losers in the chip world. Avago, found to make one of the chips on the iPhone\u2019s logic board, saw its stock hit an all-time high of $31.95 on the news, attesting to the power of Apple, not only on consumers, but on investors as well. A second winner was Qualcomm, already known to be used by Apple on the iPhone. Qualcomm produces \u201cwireless baseband chip that allows the iPhone to work on Verizon\u2019s CDMA and EVDO network\u201d according to TheStreet.com. Thus, shares in Qualcomm hit pre-Lehman values, at $55.92by 1:39 PM. The \u201cteardown\u201d comes a few days ahead of the official release of Verizon\u2019s CDMA iPhone on February 10. Canaccord Genuity took the situation as an opportunity to raise its target price from $432 to $460 citing \u201cstrong sell-through trends for the iPad and the iPhone.\u201d On the mobile side, Canaccord analysts raised their sales estimate for the iPhone from 72.9 million to 74.8 million previously on strong demand for the CDMA iPhone. In terms of tablets, increased competition from Android-fueled devices shouldn\u2019t derail sales growth in iPads, leading to an increased estimate of 34 million units from the firm. \u201cOur $460 valuation is based on shares trading at 18x our F2012 pro-forma EPS estimate,\u201d read the note. Canaccord raised all its estimates for Apple, from sales (expected at $100.3 billion for F2011) to EPS (now forecasted at $22.92 for F2011). (Read Bullish On Gold All The Way To $1,600). The constant upgrades for Apple make sense in the context that demand has been voracious for its products. (Steve Jobs ranks 42 in our Forbes 400 list). Despite fears about the fate of the company without Steve Jobs, who took a medical leave of absence to concentrate on his health in January, Apple products continue to dominate the markets. A report from comScore on 2010 fourth quarter mobile markets showed Apple sitting on the smartphone podium, along with Research In Motion and Google. Smartphone usage grew 60% to 63.2 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, according to comScore. The top performer in the all-important \u201coperating system\u201d segment for the quarter was Google\u2019s Android, which gained 7.3% of market share to outpace Apple\u2019s iOS as number two in the rankings. With 24.8% market share, Google is second to Research In Motion and its BlackBerry phones, which held 31.6% of the market, 5.7% less on a sequential basis. Apple\u2019s market share remained steady, at 25%, up 0.7% from the previous quarter, even though it got relegated to the bronze position. In afternoon trading in New York, shares in Apple were up 0.8% to $354.75 by 1:39 PM.",

        "article": "In Pennsylvania, Senator Arlen Specter, a former Republican who converted to the Democratic Party this year, quickly staked out a position in opposition to the troop escalation, while his opponent, Representative Joe Sestak, a former military officer who has been trying to run to the left of Mr. Specter, came out in favor it. Other House and Senate candidates have seized on the buildup, siding both for and against it, making it likely that the president\u2019s Afghanistan policy will be a central topic in primary races and perhaps general elections as well. With national liberal advocacy groups already mobilizing against the troop increase, the president\u2019s policy could conceivably prompt additional primary contests against Democratic incumbents, forcing them into races that consume money before general election showdowns with Republicans. Even if they do not instigate primaries, some advocacy groups can be expected to run advertisements and stage rallies against Democrats backing the escalation. Despite the possible negative impact, Democrats and some experts do see a potential benefit arising out of the party division over how to proceed in Afghanistan. For the most vulnerable Democrats \u2014 those in more conservative states and districts \u2014 a vote on the troop escalation presents an opportunity to side with Republicans on a national security issue. At the same time, it would allow a lawmaker to showcase a split with the liberal forces of the party and perhaps \u2014 depending on her ultimate view \u2014 with Speaker Nancy Pelosi herself. \u201cThat will help some Democrats in moderate districts, because it cuts into Republican opponents running against them as out-of-touch liberals,\u201d said Martin Frost, a former congressman from Texas who headed the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee during his tenure. \u201cIt is harder for a Republican opponent to go after the Democrat in a moderate district who votes with the president on the war.\u201d Mr. Frost, who was engaged in voter turnout efforts in the last election, said a stance in favor of the buildup could spur criticism from some Democratic constituents. But he said it was unlikely that those voters would then turn around and support a Republican. \u201cThey might make life difficult for the Democrat, but they are not going to stay home,\u201d he said. Some top Democrats played down the electoral ramifications of Mr. Obama\u2019s Afghanistan policy, saying the president was simply fulfilling his campaign promise to return the American military focus from Iraq to Afghanistan and its potential as a base of terrorism operations. According to this view, the real test will come in 2011, when Mr. Obama will have to choose whether to follow through on his commitment to begin removing troops from Afghanistan as he presumably starts up his own re-election campaign. Democratic strategists say that if nothing else, division over the Afghanistan policy could provide a distraction next year when party leaders had hoped to be free to focus on job creation and deficit reduction \u2014 two issues with appeal to independents. And a vote on spending $30 billion or more for the additional troops is not likely to come before next spring, pushing the contentious subject even closer to election season. While Ms. Pelosi acknowledged that Afghanistan is a difficult internal matter for Democrats, she said she did not anticipate that the troop buildup would be an overriding issue in the midterm elections. She said Democrats would be judged more on how they handle persistent national unemployment and the overall economy. \u201cMeeting the needs of America\u2019s families and seeing the progress that they make is what is important to us and to the president,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll measure our success in that way and, hopefully, the American people will too in the next election.\u201d",

        "article": "Celtic were beaten but not disgraced as they warmed up for their crucial Champions League match against Astana with a loss to Barcelona in Dublin. Barca took the lead in splendid style, Arda Turan placing a marvellous finish beyond Craig Gordon after 10 minutes. A defensive blunder from Jose Antonio Martinez gifted Leigh Griffiths a leveller, but Efe Ambrose diverted a cross into his own net a minute later. Munir Mohamed made it 3-1 to secure a comfortable win for Barca. There was no suggestion of Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers fielding a weakened side ahead of the crucial Champions League third-round, second-leg qualifier on Wednesday. Seven of the team who secured a 1-1 draw in the away leg against Astana in midweek started in Dublin. New signing Kolo Toure was not deemed ready for match action. Barca were without the likes of Gerard Pique, Andres Iniesta and Neymar for their first pre-season match, but Luis Enrique did include the towering talents of Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez. James Forrest was on the bench for the match in Kazakhstan and may wish he had been on the sidelines at the Aviva Stadium after being embarrassed in the build-up to Barcelona's opening goal. He was nutmegged and left for dead wide on the right by Aleix Vidal, who rolled the ball across the edge of the box for Turan to curl a sumptuous finish into the top corner. The Scottish champions were gifted an equaliser just before the half-hour mark, with Leigh Griffiths able to fire home from close range after Jose Antonio Martinez's errant touch near his own goal presented the striker with a tap-in. Barca regained the lead just a minute later, Ambrose turning Juan Camara's cross into his own net, before Suarez teed up Mohamed to make it 3-1 at the break. With that Champions League qualifier looming, Celtic made seven changes at the break. And with the second half punctuated by further substitutions on both sides, the match became subdued, with very few chances on created on either side. Barca left with the spoils, but Rodgers will feel it was a very useful outing for his men as they gear up for a vital 90 minutes at Celtic Park against Astana on Wednesday night. The Celtic manager was left concerned by an injury picked up by midfielder Nir Bitton, placing his participation against Astana in doubt. \"Disappointment we may have lost Nir Bitton so we'll see how he goes,\" Rodgers told Sky Sports. \"Looks like he's twisted his ankle which prevented him from being able to move so well in the first half. But other than that all the players have come through it well. \"Great experience for them and we'll be getting ready now for Wednesday.\" Celtic: Gordon, Janko, Ambrose, O'Connell, Izaguirre, Brown, Bitton, McGregor, Roberts, Griffiths, Forrest.

        "article": "I was surprised to read my colleague Damian Thompson declare that it will be quite difficult to vote Conservative at the next election in the wake of Rebekah Brooks\u2019s arrest. First of all, we should extend the presumption of innocence to her as we should to anyone who\u2019s been arrested, no matter how strongly we disapprove of the crimes they\u2019ve been accused of. But secondly \u2013 and more importantly \u2013 Gordon Brown was at least as friendly with Rebekah Brooks as David Cameron. Is Damian forgetting that it was Gordon Brown who hosted a \u201cslumber party\u201d for Brooks at Chequers on her 40th birthday in 2008 and Gordon Brown who attended her wedding to Charlie Brooks in 2009? Even Ed Milliband isn\u2019t completely untainted by this scandal, having hired ex-Times hack Tom Baldwin as his spinmeister-in-chief and attended Rupert Murdoch\u2019s annual summer party a few weeks ago. I\u2019m becoming increasingly irritated by the endless attempts by Ed Miliband, Alan Rusbridger et al to try and score party political points from this ongoing story. Yes, it casts doubt on the judgment of the Prime Minister, but it casts just as much doubt on the judgment of the last two Prime Ministers and the current leader of the Labour Party. The only political leader who\u2019s been largely untainted by this scandal is Nick Clegg \u2013 and the reason he didn\u2019t end up hobnobbing with Rupert Murdoch and Rebekah Brooks is because they didn\u2019t bother to return his calls. Come on, Damian. This is no time to lose your head. The Prime Minister has distanced himself from Brooks, distanced himself from Coulson and unlike his Labour predecessor has ordered a public inquiry into the phone-hacking scandal and the ethics of the press. He may suffer a short-term dip in his poll ratings as a result of Murdoch\u2019s humbling, but the long term damage to him and the Conservative Party will be negligible because Labour doesn\u2019t come out of this any better. And don\u2019t forget the silver lining to this cloud. The short-term bump that Ed Miliband has received as a result of his handling of this crisis has made it much more likely that he\u2019ll lead the Labour Party into the next General Election. That has to be good news for our side. Stop Press: Many people have made the point that Cameron is the serving PM while Brown is ancient history. He\u2019s the one that\u2019s been left holding the exploding parcel now that the music\u2019s stopped. But my point is that if the other lot are as tarnished by this scandal as the Tories, why would anyone switch their allegiance from Conservative to Labour as a result of it? No doubt Miliband will bring up Andy Coulson in the televised debates before the next General Election \u2013 assuming he\u2019s still standing \u2013 but Cameron will be able to throw his own party\u2019s association with the Murdoch press back in his face. Voters will conclude \u2013 rightly \u2013 that each of the main parties was equally complicit. I just don\u2019t see this as a game changer for Labour \u2013 a British spring, our Berlin Wall moment, whatever. Watergate it aint.",

Greek Foreign Minister Dimitris Droutsas said after meeting with Obeidi that \u201cthere is mobility, and there is a chance, albeit small, for a politico-diplomatic solution.\u201d But Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini said the \u201cproposals . . . to end the crisis\u201d presented by Obeidi in Greece were \u201cnot credible.\u201d Among the cease-fire proposals Obeidi is believed to have transmitted was one calling for Gaddafi to turn control of the western portion of the country over to his sons, an option that Frattini also dismissed. \u201cAny solution for the future of Libya has a precondition: that Gaddafi\u2019s regime leaves . . . that Gaddafi himself and the family leave the country,\u201d Frattini told reporters after meeting in Rome on Monday with Ali al-Essawi, the rebel council\u2019s foreign policy representative. Essawi said that any action aimed at dividing Libya \u201cis unacceptable, as is any policy initiative that does not lead to the end of the Gaddafi regime,\u201d according to a statement by the Italian Foreign Ministry. Italy\u2019s recognition follows that of France and Qatar. The Obama administration has resisted recognizing the council, saying it does not know enough about the opposition. U.S. officials have become increasingly resigned to the possibility of a military standoff on the ground, with opposition forces, under the protection of coalition airstrikes and a no-fly zone, holding the eastern part of the country while Gaddafi\u2019s forces remain in control of the west. Frattini also said that Italy will sent aircraft to the western city of Misurata, where rebel forces have been under seige by Gaddafi loyalists, to evacuate the wounded to a hospital ship. Gaddafi, he said, was also using \u201cillegal immigration as a weapon,\u201d threatening countries in the region with an influx of refugees. About 260 people, including wounded rebel fighters, were taken out of Misurata over the weekend by a Turkish ferry protected by Turkish jet fighters and naval vessels. The ship stopped Sunday in Benghazi, the de facto rebel capital in the east, to pick up more wounded.

        "article": "Carlos Brathwaite broke the hearts of an England side, which for the first time in a wonderful, fluctuating game of cricket, had sensed that the World Twenty20 title was in their grasp. When Ben Stokes was tossed the ball for the final over the match West Indies needed 19 runs for victory. Marlon Samuels, 85 not out, was still there but at the non-striker\u2019s end. Perhaps England felt this was a good thing. It transpired that this was not the case. Related: West Indies beat England to win World Twenty20 \u2013 live! In the previous two matches Stokes had been so effective when bowling the death overs; it is unlikely that Brathwaite had taken too much notice of that. The mighty right-hander stood tall in the crease and swung. Poor Stokes sought the yorker but he could never find it. The first ball was swung straight for six; so too was the second. Suddenly the match had yo-yoed yet again, with seven runs needed off four balls. Braithwaite hit another six and for a moment the batsmen thought it was all over. The players reassembled for the last rites. Whereupon Brathwaite finished the game with one more six. Stokes was inconsolable on his haunches. Earlier he had taken three brilliant outfield catches as England tenaciously worked themselves back into the game. Now he felt the villain having delivered those delicious length balls. All the England players and their coach, Trevor Bayliss, put their arms around him at the end of a melodramatic campaign. Meanwhile West Indies began to celebrate as only West Indians can. Until the Brathwaite intervention even Chris Gayle had looked nervous in their dug-out. The target had seemed so accessible. On an excellent batting surface England\u2019s 155 never seemed enough. Desperate situations in the field require desperate measures, but these rarely include tossing the new ball to a part-time off-spinner, who looks as if he has just come from choir practice. Eoin Morgan came up with a cunning plan that at first glance seemed to have many of the hallmarks of those proposed by Baldrick of Blackadder fame. In fact it was a stroke of genius by Morgan to toss the ball to Joe Root for the second over of the West Indies innings. The West Indies openers were taken aback. Obviously both of them decided that they would have nothing to do with such nonsense. Such an impertinent move demanded that Root should be smashed to all parts of Eden Gardens. Johnson Charles heaved at Root\u2019s first delivery, not a bad one, and the ball spiralled to long-on; Stokes steadied himself and took a fine catch. The batsmen had crossed so it was Gayle who drove loosely at Root\u2019s next offering, the ball sliced over cover for four. Root\u2019s third ball was handy. Gayle tried to hit it for six; again the ball spiralled; again Stokes steadied himself; West Indies 5 for 2. The match was alive. When Lendl Simmons was stuck on the crease and lbw to David Willey, whose eyes were burning with passion, it was 13 for 3. Now West Indies were indebted to Samuels, the man who scored the vital runs in their World T20 final win against Sri Lanka four years ago. He hung in for a while; he was given out on 27 but recalled when there was doubt over whether the ball had carried to Jos Buttler behind the stumps. But soon he hit some crushing blows to the shorter leg-side boundaries. Then came Brathwaite. If the end of the game was nightmarish for England, the start did not go to plan either. Jason Roy has obviously never faced Samuel Badree before and he did not seem able to establish where the ball was coming from. Roy missed the first ball of the match and it struck his left pad; the appeal was declined; he missed the second and it struck the leg stump. In the second over Alex Hales flicked at an innocuous leg-side delivery from Andre Russell and the ball flew straight into the hands of Badree standing at short-fine leg. There was a solitary boundary for Morgan before he too was duped by Badree, who propelled yet another skidding top-spinner; Badree appears in the guide-books as a leg-spinner, which should invoke the trade description act. He hardly ever bowls a leg-break. England must have known that but this was not obvious from their batting. Joe Root looked on phlegmatically, clipping boundaries whenever he could. Buttler offered reassuring assistance for seven overs. In all he hit Sulieman Benn for three sixes and West Indies were challenged at last. In pursuit of another maximum he found Darren Bravo on the mid-wicket boundary. But the partnership of 61 had given the innings some impetus. It could not be sustained as England lost three wickets for one run when they were threatening at 110 for 4. Unfortunately one of those was Root, who had batted with his usual deftness while making 54. He was dismissed when trying the most elaborate shot of his innings, a scoop over the left shoulder, which sent the ball gently to Benn at short fine leg. Willey managed to crack two sixes and England were able to bat their quota of overs but there was no disguising West Indian delight at their work in the field. Their fielding was almost flawless with Sammy cleverly managing to hide his most senior citizens, Gayle and Samuels; as has been the case throughout the tournament the bowlers went about their business intelligently; Badree was unrelenting and simple in his approach; the quicker bowlers varied their pace shrewdly; only Benn and Sammy were collared, but none so devastatingly as poor Stokes in the final over of a mesmerising contest.",

        "article": "Last year when I saw her she was dancing with the Mariinsky at the Lowry on a memorable night for St Petersburg, when its top football team Zenit was beating Glasgow Rangers up the road at the Manchester City stadium. During Balanchine\u2019s Diamonds, a roar from an offstage television tuned to the match ripped through the Lowry and all the dancers on stage broke into grins. Somova, bright blonde with glittering fingernails, claimed the ballerina role like a born WAG. \u201cYes! We were dancing but really we were all at the football match! We celebrated at the hotel afterwards with the players.\u201d Endearingly, Somova is a fervent Zenit fan. She regularly shrieks from the football stands, and has football\u2019s anthemists Andrea Bocelli and Luciano Pavarotti on her iPod. She\u2019s the first in her family to dance, and says her reed-like build comes from her father \u2013 he\u2019s in construction \u2013 and they both pile into blinis without ill effect. In Russia \u201cusually it\u2019s children from simple families who achieve most\u201d. Her mother, she says, is a tough character, and she has inherited her determination. \u201cPeople do say I am a hard worker. Without that you could never be a ballerina.\u201d A recent documentary about the Mariinsky, Bertrand Normand\u2019s Ballerina, showed a nervous young Somova in the company reigned over by the fastidiously elegant Uliyana Lopatkina and Diana Vishneva; three years later she is ranked principal alongside them. How does she answer the charge that she overeggs the physical side and distorts a glorious tradition? \u201cHmm,\u201d she pauses, \u201cI think I would like to be thought of as able to dance, to really dance, not just do a combination of gymnastic movements. But we will never dance like they used to in the past. \u201cYes, in a ballet like Sleeping Beauty I agree, I need to control it. My natural flexibility doesn\u2019t suit the artistic demands of that style but at the same time I can use it, d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 my leg more slowly and fully, and it could be high but still carefully d\u00e9velopp\u00e9d \u2013 not snapped up like in Don Quixote, for example.\u201d Clearly, then, with a recent change of coach to Tatiana Terekhova, Somova is beginning to use her head. As she says, in life 23 may be young, \u201cbut in ballet it\u2019s no longer an aspiring young girl\u201d. She tells me that she broke up with her boyfriend over her work ethic. \u201cBallet can\u2019t interest everyone \u2013 it is a life for a certain group of people, it\u2019s a high art. But people will always want to watch classical ballet. For me classics have an eternal appeal. Most of all I love Balanchine \u2013 I feel as if his ballets were made for me.\u201d Somova\u2019s shooting star contrasts with the steadier rise of 24-year-old Vladimir Shklyarov, who shares the opening-night honours with her. At the Mariinsky he stands out in the 10am class not just for his high carefree leaps and instinctively graceful carriage, but for his ferocious concentration. Afterwards, he says he has forced himself to take the daily repetitions seriously: \u201cIt\u2019s the beginning of my working day; the whole day will depend upon the way I prepare my body in the class.\u201d The Mariinsky theatre is a combination of lethal jungle, survival course and political minefield, where to come out on top takes more than just shining artistic talent. Under the previous director Makhar Vaziev, Shklyarov struggled to survive his first years: \u201cIt was up one night, down in the corps the next, you never knew why.\u201d But in the past two years, he has become the Mariinsky\u2019s new man to watch. He is less slash-and-burn than Somova about past dancers: he avidly searches out treasured snippets of past dancers on YouTube. He says that even though repeated watching underlines even great icons\u2019 flaws, \u201cyou also can analyse little professional things that people do which suddenly fire the show \u2013 I think of Igor Zelensky, Faroukh Ruzimatov, Vladimir Malakhov, the Cojocaru/Kobborg partnership. Plus, of course, our grand heroes, Nureyev and Baryshnikov. They may belong to the history of ballet\u2026 but we can still learn a lot from them, their attitude to work, their intense effort to find out new things.\u201d I ask Shklyarov when he first took ballet seriously \u2013 not until he joined the company and actually performed, he replies. What if he hadn\u2019t got in? \u201cI\u2019d have killed myself,\u201d he says. \u201cOnly kidding. Of course, I have a lot of other interests, but I think I would have just vanished in any other life.\u201d I try to imagine Shklyarov and Somova vanishing in another life, and somehow it seems unlikely.",

        "article": "If you\u2019ve ever served individual cocktails, made to order, to each of your party guests \u2014 the one who wants a gimlet, the one who wants a martini on the rocks with three olives, please \u2014 you know that that way lies madness. There\u2019s really only one way to serve a large group sanely: Punch is the party host\u2019s liquid liberator. It is inherently festive and categorically communal. It must be prepared in advance, in the rela\u00adtive quietude that exists in the kitchen a few hours before the meal begins. Then, when the party\u2019s on and the joint is jumping, all you have to do is occasionally replenish the punch bowl. To start, consider the food you\u2019re serving at the party. Here, I was inspired by the Texan feast in this issue, and sought out a Southwestern-accented punch devised by Alba Huerta, owner and bartender at Julep, a Houston cocktail bar. I was after something not too sweet but still celebratory, earthy but sophisticated, and Huerta\u2019s West Cave Cellar Punch is just right. It\u2019s not a punch you can just whip up with whatever\u2019s lurking in your liquor cabinet and pantry, but the holidays merit a bit of a fuss \u2014 and a bit of a splurge. A few ingredients may be unfamiliar. First, it requires the making of oleo-saccharum. The word may sound like an ancient Roman curse \u2014 go ahead, shout Oleo-saccharum! at your adversaries and give them a good start \u2014 but it\u2019s what David Wondrich, in his book \u2018\u2018Punch: The Delights (and Dangers) of the Flowing Bowl,\u2019\u2019 describes as \u2018\u2018dog Latin for \u2018oil-sugar.\u2019 \u2019\u2019 Oleo-saccharum isn\u2019t difficult to prepare, but you\u2019ll need to factor an extra hour into your prep time. Combining citrus peel with sugar to extract as much of the peel\u2019s fragrant oils as possible provides an exceptionally flavorful foundation for punch that many consider essential. Oleo-saccharum most often calls for lemon peels and white sugar; here, Huerta uses instead two deeper, darker sugars \u2014 palm sugar and panela, unrefined cane sugar \u2014 and the peels of grapefruit and its comely and commodious cousin, the pomelo. Sotol is made from desert spoon, a dreamily named plant that grows in northern Mexico and parts of the Southwestern United States. It is distilled in a process similar to mezcal, but it\u2019s generally lower in alcohol than its cousin, and mellower. The pomelo juice (be warned: It takes effort to extract) \u2018\u2018accentuates the earthiness of the sotol,\u2019\u2019 Huerta says, and \u2018\u2018the sugars offer a hint of butterscotch and caramel flavors that bring out the vanillin quality of the spirit.\u2019\u2019 Palo cortado \u2014 a rare, complex sherry \u2014 contributes some depth and nuttiness. Tequila fortifies it, harmoniously. Mandarin orange liqueur amplifies the citrus of the pomelo and grapefruit. And sparkling wine gives it the buoyancy and bubbles to remind us that punch wants us to have a good time \u2014 and that nothing\u2019s more important than that at a holiday celebration.

        "article": "As someone who has frequently visited Charleston, I am devastated by the killings at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. Any mass shooting brings revulsion and anger, but the people killed Wednesday night, particularly the pastor of this church, represent the best of Charleston. They were people who, through their church and its history, helped lead the city, and by extension our nation, away from racism and toward a better future for everyone, black and white. These are losses that cannot be made up. These are people who cannot be replaced. It looks to be a random hate crime, and whether that turns out to be the case or not, it is still a tragedy. We should wait, however, before making judgments until more facts come to light. The church where these shootings took place was burned to the ground in the pre-Civil War era and then met in secret for years because of white hostility toward it and black-oriented churches in general. Many major civil rights leaders of the 20th and 21st centuries have spoken there, including the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. It stands as a symbol of survival through the long period when racism was not merely tolerated, but also part of official government policy. I am Southern, I am white, I am Republican, I am conservative and I am heartbroken. That someone would do this is beyond my comprehension. I do not pretend to understand why a young man would walk into a place of worship and commit this horrible crime; I only know that there is an uncontrolled evil in the hearts of some men. The police have caught the young man believed to be the shooter, but I don\u2019t expect that the suspect will provide rational answers that will comfort anyone or fully explain the murders. There is no punishment, no judicial process, no retribution that will bring back the dead, or that will assuage the broken hearts of the survivors. I can only say to the survivors and members of their church and community that your fellow Americans \u2014 black and white \u2014 grieve with you and mourn your loss. When a white gunman shoots nine people dead in a black church in South Carolina, this is a \u201chate crime.\u201d When two Muslim gunmen open fire at an exhibition of cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad in Texas, this is \u201cterrorism.\u201d Why isn\u2019t the attack on the A.M.E. Church in Charleston not labeled \u201cterrorism\u201d and the assault on the cartoon exhibition a \u201chate crime\u201d? Is \u201cterrorism\u201d restricted to attacks whose intended victims are largely straight white people? The label \u201cterrorism\u201d is intended to make us all afraid. \u201cHate crimes\u201d instill fear mainly in minorities \u2014 African-Americans, Hispanics, Asians, Muslims, L.G.B.T.Q. Why can\u2019t we own up to the fact that hate crimes are just another form of terrorism, perhaps the worst, since they target the weak among us? Of the many fathomless dimensions to this unspeakable crime, one haunts me most: If the suspect\u2019s race and age provoked private misgivings among Emanuel A.M.E. Church parishioners, they nonetheless welcomed him to their Wednesday night prayer meeting, thus choosing in their last minutes to live with a grace and purity of heart that few among us can hope to touch.

        "article": "The one thing that Cramer does know is that before China broke down, it had a plan to make consumers wealthier in the stock market. It took the cue of Ben Bernanke and cut interest rates in order to entice investors to buy stocks for yield. In return, that drove up stocks, which created greater wealth. That is exactly what the Chinese government attempted to do, but it went wrong. It put money to work into a bunch of junk companies, not the high quality bond-market equivalents. Then, it allowed investors to use an obscene amount of margin to buy stocks, which led to the unstable disaster that the Chinese stock market has become. And while the U.S. market did not roar when the Chinese stock market skyrocketed into the stratosphere, Cramer warned that it will react to the Chinese crash. In his opinion, this crash revealed that the Communist Party is less powerful and prudent than initially thought. \"They are, alas, not invincible, and we are beginning to believe that perhaps they don't even know what the heck they are doing,\" Cramer said. (Tweet This) The confusion seems apparent to Cramer when he thinks about some of the silly moves that the Chinese government has made. It basically criminalized short selling. It created a bureau of stock buying to prop up stocks and it closes trading in stocks all the time. What the heck? \"This stuff, frankly, is insane, but nobody likes to say it out loud because the capitalist roaders running Communist China are supposed to be better, smarter and more powerful than we are,\" Cramer added. It really put the icing on the cake when China decided to devalue its currency in one fell swoop. This move shocked Cramer, as the devaluation was sudden and six times bigger than what it has done in the past decade. At this point, with the strong dollar wreaking havoc on American companies doing business overseas oil dropping lower, the only thing that is really working is housing. Cramer has seen in the past that housing can be an amazing tonic for the economy. The U.S. is on pace to build 1.2 million homes this year, which is on par to the rate before the Great Recession. That is great news for the economy. And there have been many days recently where China behaved itself, the dollar didn't go higher, oil stabilized and interest rates went down. We could easily have another one of those days on Wednesday. Read more from Mad Money with Jim Cramer Cramer Remix: Why Monday's market blew me away Cramer: Rebuilding housing stocks\u2014make a move NOW! Cramer: JC Penney is about to smoke competition The important thing that Cramer wants investors to understand is that housing has become the goose of the market. So, on days like Tuesday, it may give the impression that that the market is strong enough to power through the bad news of China. \"But if China gets hammered again and the dollar goes still higher, and we get some Fed head saying rates need to be raised, then the set-up will be very bad, and I need you to be ready for some turmoil,\" Cramer said. So, while housing can work wonders for an economy, it won't work wonders for the stock market. There is just too much that can go wrong for the housing goose to carry the market. Time to buckle up for more turmoil ahead.",

More than 27 per cent of babies were born by caesarean section last year \u2013 an all time high and up by a third over the course of the decade. New data from NHS Digital shows caesareans accounted for 26.5 per of all births in 2014/15 and 24.1 per cent a decade ago. In 1990/91, just over 12 per cent of deliveries were by C-section. The operations are more common among older women, and are also more likely if a woman is obese. There were 648,107 deliveries in NHS hospitals during 2015/16, an increase of 1.8 per cent on the previous year. Among women aged 40 and over, the number of deliveries has risen from 22,123 in 2005/06 to 24,942 in 2015/16 \u2013 a rise of 12.7 per cent over the course of the decade. The detailed data shows that older mums are much more likely than their younger peers to give birth by C-section, and are more likely to have a pre-planned caesarean. Some 1,326 women aged 45 to 49 gave birth in 2015/16, with more than half (57.8 per cent) of the deliveries being by C-section. Almost a third (31.3 per cent) of these births were by planned caesarean, while a further 26.5 per cent were through caesareans carried out in an emergency. Among the 23,502 women aged 40 to 44 who gave birth, 22.8 per cent of deliveries were by planned caesarean, with a further 20 per cent by emergency. These figures are significantly higher than for younger age groups, with 17.6 per cent of those aged 35 to 29 having a planned caesarean and a further 17 per cent needing an emergency section. Among those aged 30 to 34, 12.6 per cent of deliveries were planned caesarean sections and a further 15.8% were carried out in an emergency. Planned caesareans were also more common among more affluent mothers, with 14.2 per cent of deliveries in the the most affluent group by planned caesarean section in 2015/16, compared to 9.9 per cent of the least deprived. Affluent mothers also tend to be older. As expected, the proportion of natural births has fallen over time. From 2005/06 to 2008/09, the proportion of deliveries where women went into labour naturally \u2013 and were not induced or needed caesarean \u2013 stayed at about 69 per cent but that has fallen to 57 per cent in 2015/16.",

        "article": "The presidential contest is a race to 270 electoral votes. The national vote is irrelevant. The solid blue and red states are irrelevant. If we look at RealClearPolitics (RCP), Mitt Romney comfortably has 191 electoral votes on his side. He needs 79 more electoral votes to win outright, 78 to send it to the House. The RCP toss-up states are Colorado (9), Iowa (6), Florida (29), Nevada (6), New Hampshire (4), North Carolina (15) and Virginia (13). Are there polls showing Romney ahead or within the margin of error in all these? Yes. Are Wisconsin, Ohio and Michigan longer shots but still within reach? Yes. This is why this race remains highly competitive. A few days ago I posited that five factors could significantly impact the race: further economic deterioration; a lousy debate performance or two from President Obama; widespread doubts about the president\u2019s honesty on Libya; another foreign policy incident; and rising gas prices. Do some of these look quite possible? Even more so than when I first listed them. In fact the Libya scandal is building as more and more facts come to light about what the Obama administration knew and what it was telling the American people. The Obama team\u2019s defense, namely that it was too dense to know that the attack on the Consulate in Benghazi was coordinated by al-Qaeda (weren\u2019t the black al-Qaeda flag and the shouts \u201cWe are Osama\u201d a clue?), is not an attractive argument to make. Meanwhile, word comes from Defense Secretary Leon Panetta that we\u2019ve \u201clost track\u201d of Syria\u2019s chemical weapons: \u201cLeading from behind\u201d is proving to be a disaster for the country, our allies and the president. And maybe most important, the economy is grinding to a dead halt. Obama alternately says that things are getting better or that no one could have done better. Neither is credible at this point. As Jim Pethokoukis points out: \u201cIf you take into account combined high unemployment, low labor force participation, and slow GDP growth, 2012 might well be the worst non-recession, non-depression year in the history of the United States. The only other challenger is 2011. Or maybe next year.\u201d When you are presiding over an economy that looks less horrible than it would otherwise be if not for all the people who\u2019ve given up looking for work, that\u2019s a problem. (\u201cThe only reason the unemployment rate has declined to near 8% from 10% (and isn\u2019t over 11%) is that the labor force has collapsed and millions of unemployed are no longer being counted by the government.\u201d) For all these reasons you can readily see why the liberal narrative that the race is over is aspirational and not factual. Arguing that the \u201cpolls are real\u201d or pointing to the latest gaffe is satisfying for the anxious liberal pundits, I suppose, but neither is an argument to vote for Obama. Neither phenomenon is any guarantee that Obama\u2019s \u201clead\u201d is any more lasting than his \u201drecovery\u201d (which lasted less than the length of an NBA season). Romney certainly could win this race; the open question is whether he will do what it takes to break through to the voters in the very close contests in the critical states.",

        "article": "\u201cThe community of sighters has really expanded through digital technology \u2014 on a global basis,\u201d said Neil McGinness, the chief executive of Weekly World News. \u201cIt really speeds up now because the chatter on the Web \u2014 it just burns like crazy.\u201d And The Weekly World News, the happy home of Bat Boy and other paranormal stories, is happily receptive. Alien stories draw readers and reader comments \u2014 \u201cprobably more so than any other phenomenon,\u201d he said. But these days, U.F.O. sightings rarely cause a stir outside of Mr. McGinness\u2019s pages or Web sites for buffs, says John Pike of GlobalSecurity.org. \u201cThe \u2018Modern Myth of Things Seen in the Sky\u2019 no longer resonates with the public the way it did when a tricorder or talking computers seemed miraculous,\u201d he said. Even when incidents break out of the buff ghetto nowadays, smarty-pants killjoys often come up with perfectly reasonable explanations. Take the recent spiraling light over Australia, which many took to be a U.F.O. It was quickly tied to the launch of Falcon 9, the spacecraft created by billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk\u2019s company, SpaceX. Phil Plait, the creator of the debunk-eriffic Bad Astronomy blog at Discovermagazine.com, says that on the one hand, digital media \u201cmay be hurting the cause of reality: such nonsense gets spread much faster than it used to.\u201d But \u201cit\u2019s easier for the correct explanation to spread as well.\u201d He noted that in March, people marveled at a bright object over Lake Erie and Cleveland. Mr. Plait wrote: \u201cCould it be an alien visitor from another world? No, I don\u2019t think so. In fact, I think it is another world. Venus, to be specific.\u201d The basic problem, Mr. Plait said, is that people rarely look up into the dark sky and know what\u2019s normal, much less abnormal. The singer James McMurtry summed it up nicely in his song \u201cLevelland\u201d: Mama used to roll her hair Back before the central air We\u2019d sit outside and watch the stars at night. She\u2019d tell me to make a wish, I\u2019d wish we both could fly. Don\u2019t think she\u2019s seen the sky Since we got the satellite dish. ... Of course, the odds are steeply against humans being the only life in the vastness of the universe. The blunt reality of distance measured in light-years, however, makes travel between the stars unlikely. Still, we hold on to the mysteries left to us, savoring guilty pleasures like Larry King\u2019s alien (check the picture \u2014 that could be a family resemblance) and not trying too hard to understand phenomena like the Marfa lights. On this planet, where a hole in the ground of our own making spews millions of gallons of toxic slush, surely it\u2019s O.K. to hope that there\u2019s intelligent life, well, somewhere.

All things considered, the trip goes well save for the poet\u2019s habitual breakfast \u2014 a bottle of whisky. \u201cThis was quite refreshing\u201d, says an American professor as they depart. \u201cI teach folklore \u2014 but I almost never come into any living, breathing contact with it.\u201d (Eric Wilson, Lithub, 7,200 words) Music | Dylan goes electricDiscussion of recent books about Bob Dylan and music piracy. Dylan\u2019s electric show at the Newport Festival in 1965 put an end to the folk revival and invented modern rock. The years that Dylan then spent jamming with The Band in Woodstock inadvertently revolutionised music a second time. Out-takes from the sessions were made into the first-ever bootleg LP, The Great White Wonder, launching the pirate onslaught that would change the music industry in decades to come even more than Dylan had changed music itself.

They want \u201ctalking-point books\u201d which take a seductive idea and attach a string of anecdotes to it; Malcolm Gladwell is the genre\u2019s patron saint. Happily, this \u2018crisis\u2019 has already found a solution. Serious non-fiction has migrated to the university presses. Yale has the best non-fiction list in the world right now.

        "article": "Donald Trump often brags about his business acumen and Ivy League degree. Presumably he knows how to read an earnings report. So it seems likely that the Republican presidential nominee knew he was not being completely honest when he told a crowd in Miami on Wednesday that \u201cearnings for the New York Times are down 97 percent this year.\u201d Trump: \"Earnings for the New York Times are down 97 percent this year. I feel so bad for them. And then they tell you who to vote for.\" \u2014 Igor Bobic (@igorbobic) November 2, 2016 As I have written before, Trump loves bad news about the media industry. He has said that he is \u201crunning against the crooked media,\u201d so it follows that he would delight in the financial struggles of news outlets he considers political opponents. [More bad news for newspapers is good news for Donald Trump] Trump threw his latest jab as the New York Times Co. released its third-quarter earnings report on Wednesday. The report showed total revenue of $1.1 billion through the first nine months of the year, down 1.7 percent from the same period in 2015. Operating profit stood at $46 million through three quarters, down 5.9 percent. That's not exactly fist-pumping news for the Times, but it does not suggest the massive decline claimed by Trump. Where did he get that 97 percent figure? You don't need to have studied at Wharton to notice that Trump cited a number from the third-quarter column, not the year-to-date column. The third-quarter column is not the right place to find earnings figures for \u201cthis year.\u201d What's funny is that if Trump had taken numbers from the right place, he would have been able to say that the Times's net income dropped 224 percent. The company had net income of $11.2 million through the first three quarters of 2015 but a net loss of $13.8 million during the same period of 2016. Trump would have had to do some arithmetic to get the 224-percent number, however, because percentages greater than 100 are simply marked with an asterisk on the balance sheet. Whatever the number \u2014 97 percent or 224 percent \u2014 the New York Times Co.'s net income figure requires some important context. To hear Trump tell it, the Times is careening toward financial ruin because voters are turning away from the newspaper's biased coverage. I prefer to think they are turning to The Washington Post. In reality, however, the Times added 116,000 digital news subscribers in the third quarter. And circulation revenue rose 2.8 percent in the first nine months of the year. So what happened to net income? Go back to the balance sheet, and you'll see that the Times Co. has lost $41.8 million from \u201cjoint ventures\u201d in 2016. That's way, way up from just $758,000 in 2015. Losing an extra $41.1 million on joint ventures more than accounts for the company's decline in net income. What are these joint ventures? Follow the reference to footnote (g) and you get your answer: \u201cIn the first nine months of 2016, the company recorded $43.5 million loss from joint ventures, related to the announced closure of a paper mill operated by Madison Paper Industries, in which the company has an investment through a subsidiary.\u201d That's right. The sharp drop in net income at the New York Times Co. is not about the newsroom, as Trump would have you believe; it is about the closure of a paper mill. The Times's third-quarter earnings report is not a dream come true, and no one is saying that newspapers don't face real financial challenges. But the numbers do not support the familiar Trump narrative that the New York Times is \u201cdying\u201d because its reporting \u201cgets worse and worse by the day.\u201d The reporting at the failing @nytimes gets worse and worse by the day. Fortunately, it is a dying newspaper. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 19, 2016",

        "article": "Part of adjusting to their new life in Canada for teenagers Bashar Tweresh, Mahmoud Abou Baker, and brothers Walid and Ahmad Alali has been readjusting to life in a classroom. In Syria, all four worked at jobs normally reserved for adults. Since arriving in Ottawa in January, the four teenagers have been getting intensive English instruction at Ridgemont High School, where teachers are trying to accommodate their unique life experience. \"Good school,\" nods Bashar Tweresh. \"Two classes English, one math, one gym.\" His hair shaved short on the sides and stacked stylishly high on top, Tweresh wears a black T-shirt with a gothic rock logo across the chest. He looks a bit like a Syrian Justin Bieber, and confesses he knows nothing of the band whose name adorns the donated shirt. When Tweresh was 12, his father developed kidney disease. His mother donated one of her kidneys, so Tweresh \u2014 their oldest child \u2014 had to find a job. He learned how to cut hair and, though he tried to attend school, the turmoil in Syria made that difficult. Tweresh spent four years working as a barber, first in Syria, then in Jordan, before arriving in Ottawa in January. Bashar Tweresh, 16, worked as a barber in Syria and Jordan for four years before coming to Ottawa. (Stu Mills/CBC) Returning to school hasn't been easy for the teenager, but Tweresh says he values the opportunity to improve himself, and the diploma he will earn. When the spring semester ends, he and many of his Syrian classmates will continue with summer classes, though he would love a chance to take in a soccer game \u2014 his real passion \u2014 at TD Place. Teacher Nadia Ghandi says when the class learned Tweresh was a barber before arriving in Canada, they decided to let him trim another teacher's beard. \"Bashar, as a student is very lively and outgoing, but as soon as he had his work kit and work belt he went from 16 to 33 years old \u2014 very meticulous and focussed,\" Ghandi said. \"It's amazing as an educator to see two identities.There's tremendous work ethic and drive that he brings to Ottawa.\" \"Thank God there's a place like Canada, where they understand that people under the age of 18 should be dedicating their time to studies and learning,\" Tweresh says through translator Omar Mahfoudi of Ottawa's Islamic Care Centre. Walid Alali, 16, studied under a gardener in Syria. (Stu Mills/CBC) Walid Alali, also 16, bears deep scars on his chest and left arm from a fire that nearly killed him when he was just two. Though he studied under a gardener in Syria, he jokes that he never acquired a green thumb, and is happy to be back in school. Mahmoud Abou Baker worked as a carpenter in Syria but the teen is now in high school in Ottawa. (Stu Mills/CBC) Mahmoud Abou Baker, wearing a crisp, blue linen shirt, his hair shaped into a modern take on a crooner's asymmetrical wedge, is the joker in the group, calling Canadian weather both \"very hot and very cold.\" But his face turns serious when he talks of his years working as a carpenter in Syria, mainly building houses, but also furniture. The Grade 9 student said he would like to have the opportunity to work in construction while studying in school, but is in no rush to pick up a hammer again. \"We already worked like adults before. We'd like to take the opportunity to continue learning,\" he says. \"If I had just wanted to work, I could have continued working in Lebanon. We want somewhere where we can flourish.\" Ahmad Alali worked as a gardener, a bricklayer and assisting auto mechanics in Syria. (Stu Mills/CBC) Ahmad Alali is older, more serious, and more nervous about the interview. With a furrowed brow, he gives his age as \"18 ...19.\" Alali isn't certain about his birth date. In Syria the tall teenager laboured as a gardener, a bricklayer and assisting auto mechanics. Alali says his uncle was a barber and had planned to teach him the business, though the war meant Alali never got a chance to take him up on the offer. Alali still wants to be a hair stylist, but not until he finishes school. \"We could have continued working where we were,\" said Alali through the translator. \"Schooling is more important. We've got to put in our time for school, then we can work later.\" Ghandi points out that unlike younger refugees, these Syrian teenagers may have only four or five years in the education system to learn the language and figure out their future. The Islamic Care Centre's Omar Mahfoudi helped with translation during the interviews. \"How can we, while they're learning English, while they're getting the routine of school, how can we propel them into the world of work, quicker, accelerated, without having the language barrier completely block it?\" Despite that significant obstacle, the teenagers seem unfazed. Mahfoudi the translator says he's surprised by how at-ease they appear. \"I told them, 'You guys seem like you have some aspirations, some dedication. You have a chance here. Canada has good support and recognition for people with trades, and certainly it's a great place for opportunity.'\" \"And they all echoed that back, 'That's exactly what we want.' They want a good future.\" \u200b",

Photograph: AP Pope Francis plans to drive around Vatican City at the wheel of a popemobile that is a lot like him: frugal, clad in white and with a fair bit of mileage. The 1984 Renault 4 with 186,000 miles on the clock was given to him by a 70-year-old priest from northern Italy, Father Renzo Zocca, who took the pope for a spin inside the walls of the tiny city-state. \"I think the pope will drive it a bit himself inside the Vatican,\" the Holy See's deputy spokesman, Father Ciro Benedettini, said on Thursday. After the pope appealed to priests several months ago not to drive expensive cars but to save money and give it to the poor, Zocca wrote him a letter saying he had used the same car for decades and wanted to give it to the pope as a symbolic gift. Last weekend Zocca brought the car, along with some of his parishioners, to the Vatican, where the pope told him he knew how to drive it because he had had a Renault 4 in Argentina. The pope, 76, then got in and drove it, Zocca told the Italian Catholic magazine Famiglia Cristiana (Christian Family). Francis, who as a cardinal in Buenos Aires travelled by subway, has shown a predilection for simple means of transport ever since his election in March as the first non-European pope in 1,300 years. On the night of his election he shunned the bulletproof papal Mercedes limousine and rode in a minibus with the cardinals who had chosen him to lead the Roman Catholic church. During his trip to Brazil in July he was driven around Rio de Janeiro in a small silver Fiat at his own request, and when he visited a refugee centre in Rome on Tuesday he used a Ford Focus from the Vatican's car pool. Francis has shunned the spacious and luxurious papal apartments used by his predecessors and has opted to live in a small suite in a Vatican guesthouse. Although Francis will probably never need them in Rome, which is hit by serious snow only about once every 25 years, Zocca said his snow tyres were still in the boot. \"You never know,\" he told Famiglia Cristiana.",

        "article": "Back in New Hampshire, he started making films. First they were shorts, like \"Barnacles Tell No Lies,\" which is still used in college courses, and \"Lobstahs,\" which features a biologist dressed in a lobster outfit and a song, Dr. Olson's first, that goes \"lobsters may be spineless but they taste the best to me.\" That led to a longer film about lobstermen, \"Salt of the Earth,\" which was shown on public television in Maine. Eventually, Dr. Olson said, \"I realized if I wanted to get really serious I had to go to film school.\" But abandoning a tenured faculty position at a major university was no small step. He recalled that on his first visit to the University of Southern California, where he ultimately enrolled, he hid when he saw a New Hampshire colleague on campus. When he finally began taking courses, he took a leave of absence from his teaching post, in case the venture turned into a disaster. Instead, it was a success. Even though he entered film school at 38, far older than his 49 fellow students, he was one of four chosen to produce a student film, and it was shown at the Telluride Film Festival. After graduation, he made videos for the Rutgers University ocean science program and for the Shifting Baselines Ocean Media Project, which he and Dr. Jackson organized. The Web site for the project, shiftingbaselines.org, features short films, a blog, links to news articles and studies. Its aim is to convey serious information about environmental issues, but always with humor. He also made his first film on science communication per se \u0097 \"Talking Science,\" a guide for researchers. (One who volunteered to be filmed giving a presentation discovered to his dismay that he said \"um\" on average every seven seconds, and spent 87 percent of his time staring at his own slides, ignoring his audience.) \"Flock of Dodos\" opened earlier this year in Kansas, where the reception was just what a filmmaker might dream of: cheers, jeers, questions and discussion from a highly engaged audience. Since then it has been shown at several college campuses, where it has drawn enthusiastic crowds. So Dr. Olson hopes the film has commercial potential. That would certainly be useful. Though many in science bemoan their collective inability to get their messages across to the public, big grant-makers have yet to embrace Dr. Olson's approach. \"I get hundreds of inquiries from students and graduate students wanting to do what I am doing, to get into this interface between science and the media,\" Dr. Olson said. \"There just isn't any financial support for it. The science world does not understand media, does not support it. They don't see the need for innovation.\" Dr. Jackson said some scientists, even those interested in communicating science, \"squirm\" at Dr. Olson's irreverent approach. Others wonder whether his wry humor will translate to a wider audience. Dr. Olson says, \"We'll find out at Tribeca.\" Meanwhile, he lives in Hollywood, financing his films with money from his family, sympathetic researchers and off-and-on teaching gigs \u0097 he was for years a part-time member of the biology faculty at U.S.C. \"I have health insurance, but just barely,\" he said. \"I think it runs out next month.\" But he says he does not regret his decision to abandon the security of the academy for the uncertainty of filmmaking. \"I have a much greater fear of boredom than I do of poverty,\" he said.",

        "article": "Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is heading to the backyard of rival John Kasich tonight after a tumultuous week of dubious claims about Muslims and fisticuffs at an Alabama rally. The Ohio governor wants to use the event to derail him. Trump is speaking at a Columbus event blocks from Kasich\u2019s office after drawing criticism in recent days for advocating the tracking of Muslims and suggesting that Islamic crowds in New Jersey cheered the collapse of the World Trade Center towers, an assertion for which there is no proof. While Trump continues to lead polls for the Republican nomination, Kasich is part of a stepped-up effort seeking to paint the real-estate mogul as unprepared to lead and unable to defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton. Kasich\u2019s super-PAC, which is spending $2.5 million on a New Hampshire ad campaign targeting Trump, says it is attracting donors supporting other presidential candidates to help with the attacks. \u201cThe next President needs to unify Americans, not divide them,\u201d George Voinovich, a former Republican U.S. senator and Ohio governor, said in an e-mail that the Kasich campaign circulated before the rally. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s rhetoric has been egomaniacal, inflammatory, and divisive.\u201d Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks didn\u2019t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment on Kasich\u2019s efforts. Trump comes to the must-win swing state today after a week that included criticism from Kasich and fellow Republican candidates former Florida Governor Jeb Bush and U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas after Trump spoke about creating a database of Muslims after the Nov. 13 terrorist attacks in Paris that killed 130 people. Civil libertarians have observed that the Constitution forbids making laws that target specific religions. Asked by ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos on his This Week show on Sunday whether he was \u201cunequivocally now ruling out a database on all Muslims,\u201d Trump replied, \u201cNo, not at all. I want a database for the refugees that -- if they come into the country. We have no idea who these people are.\u201d Trump also defended his comments at a Saturday rally in Birmingham, Alabama, that he saw thousands of people in Jersey City cheering the collapse of the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001. While the PolitiFact website labeled the claim wholly false, Trump told Stephanopoulos, \u201cIt did happen. I saw it.\u201d At the Birmingham rally, a white man punched and tried to choke a black protester, prompting Trump to call for the protester\u2019s removal, according to the Washington Post. He later said the man might have deserved to be roughed up. Kasich\u2019s attacks on Trump come as other donors are joining forces to target the Republican front-runner. A new \u201cguerilla campaign\u201d called Trump Card LLC is forming, the Wall Street Journal reported Friday. Matt David, chief strategist for the Kasich super-PAC New Day for America, told Reuters that 10 new donors backing different presidential candidates have already given money and pledges totaling more than $1 million to help with the attacks. The super-PAC\u2019s ad now running in New England, part of a campaign that will include direct mail, radio, and digital advertising, suggests that Trump and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson would need \u201con-the-job training\u201d to deal with international crises such as the Paris attacks. \u201cWe want to call out people who are saying outrageous things and clearly aren\u2019t prepared to be our commander in chief,\u201d spokeswoman Connie Wehrkamp said. The ad sparked a volley of tweets between Trump and Kasich last week, with Trump issuing insults such as, \u201cI want to do negative ads on John Kasich, but he is so irrelevant to the race that I don\u2019t want to waste my money.\u201d Kasich is greeting Trump\u2019s arrival Monday with a conference call of Ohio leaders critical of him and an event with veterans including Thomas Moe, who spent five years in the infamous Hanoi Hilton in Vietnam with U.S. Sen. John McCain. Kasich has languished near the bottom of national polls and in the middle of the pack in New Hampshire, where he hopes to break through in the nation\u2019s first primary on Feb. 9. In recent weeks, he has taken a more aggressive stance on the campaign trail and in televised debates, criticizing proposals from Trump and highlighting his own experience as a two-term governor and 18-year member of Congress. While it remains to be seen how effective the attacks on Trump will be, there\u2019s an opportunity, said Stuart Stevens, a senior adviser to Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee. \u201cTrump has always been vulnerable, because the premise of his campaign is based on Trump, and I think Trump is a ridiculous figure as a presidential candidate,\u201d Stevens said in a telephone interview.",

        "article": "MIO, Mich., July 4\u2014 There is not much going on in this little town. What few jobs there are pay the minimum wage. Shopping requires a 40-mile round trip. And yet the people keep coming, and as a result the north woods population is booming. ''The city people come up here with a 'whatever's here, it's got to be better than down there' attitude,'' said James Davisson. ''They're tired of the crime, they're tired of the race problem, tired of taxes, tired of the whole concrete jungle.'' He ought to know. Five years ago Mr. Davisson gave up a job in Saginaw as Michigan representative for Winchester Arms for life in the northern woods of Michigan's Lower Peninsula. The move brought some very lean years to him and his family before he got going as publisher of a small weekly newspaper and as a seller of log homes, but now he says he would never go back to the city. Others Share Sentiment He is hardly alone. Oscoda County, of which this little crossroads community is the seat, is one of the fastest-growing counties in Michigan, according to the latest census figures. The county's population increased 45 percent in the last decade, to 6,858 from 4,726, without the benefit of new industry or businesses to draw newcomers. In fact, the county had nothing but clean air, cool nights, strict schools and some of the best trout fishing around. These small numbers for Oscoda County, multiplied by the dozens of other northern counties in the Lower Peninsula, added up to one of the sharpest population increases in a nation whose rural population is growing in nearly every region. Over the last decade, Michigan's metropolitan areas grew by just six-tenths of 1 percent, while its rural areas increased by 20 percent. Rural Growth Seen Nationally Although the nation is still overwhelmingly urban, with threequarters of its people living in cities of 50,000 or more, the rural growth trend is nationally apparent visible for the first time. From 1970 to 1980, the nation's metropolitan areas grew by 9 percent, while the population of the rest of the country its forests and plains and mountainous reaches, grew by 15 1/2 percent. Judging by the reasons given by some of the newcomers discovered among the streams and jack pine of Oscoda County, these movements were prompted by the same desires that motivated the back-to-the-soil movement of the 1960's: a desire for peacefulness and tranquility, freedom from the fear of serious crime, a slower pace of life and a renewed sense of family closeness. ''The money's in the city, the conveniences are all there, but living there is the pits,'' said Jerome Lasarte, a 38-year-old tile setter who left Wyandotte, on Detroit's southern edge, to move up here two years ago with his wife and two small children. Urban Problems a Big Factor ''You never know if your kids are safe down there,'' Mr. Lasarte said, ''you have to worry every time you leave your house. It's not worth it.'' According to Calvin Beale, a demographer at the United States Department of Agriculture, the rural revival has taken several forms. ''In northern New England the majority of them are from the New York-Boston urban axis,'' he said. ''They're fairly sophisticated, highly educated, lots of white-collar people.'' In northern Michigan, he said, most of the newcomers ''came out of the Midwestern manufacturing belt.'' ''They have an industrial background, and their educational level is a little lower than in the Northeast,'' he said. Migration Is Mostly White ''And then you definitely find people moving up there out of concern for their safety, and especially the safety of their children,'' Mr. Beale said. ''They feel that even the suburbs are no longer safe from crime, and they try to get as far away as they can.'' Perhaps as a consequence, the movement has been almost entirely white. The 1980 census for Oscoda County lists one black, but no one seems to know who it might be. William Jewell, 54, an employee of Detroit's Transportation Department, watched as his East Side neighborhood began to deteriorate six or seven years ago just as Brenda, his youngest child, was entering junior high school. Whites were fleeing the city and their places were being taken by blacks, and Brenda began to complain about fighting and racial animosity in school. Most of the Jewell's white neighbors had moved to the suburbs, but as a municipal employee, Mr. Jewell was required to live in the city. Cabin Is Answer for One Family ''Finally, it got so Brenda couldn't walk to school alone anymore and I was a nervous wreck,'' Mrs. Jewell recalled. ''So I said to my husband, 'Maybe you can't leave Detroit but I can.' And I did.'' The Jewells fixed up a summer cabin they had bought in McKinley, which is just down the road from Mio, put in a wood stove, and Mrs. Jewell and Brenda moved in 5 years ago. Mr. Jewell now lives in a trailer in Detroit, driving the 200 miles to his ''home'' each weekend. Mrs. Jewell is waiting for her husband to retire in about three years and move north for good. Retirement has been an important reason for the population growth in rural areas, partly because retirees find they can stretch an inflation-riddled pension further here than in the city. For some, however, life in the country does have its drawbacks. ''When TV is the most exciting thing around, you know you're in a little trouble,'' said Mr. Davisson. ''It's getting to where I can't stand the heehaw anymore. I care about nuclear policy and cancercausing chemicals, and if I have to listen to one more conversation about chainsaws, I'll scream.'' Mr. Davisson thinks things are getting a little crowded around here anyway, what with all the flatlanders coming in. He said he has started thinking about Montana.

        "article": "NEW YORK \u2013 Angus Young of AC/DC says his band mates have not been in touch with Phil Rudd since he was charged with threatening to kill and possessing methamphetamine and marijuana last week. Young, 59, said in an interview Thursday that Rudd's behavior was somewhat erratic while recording the band's new album, \"Rock or Bust,\" which is due to be released on Dec. 2. \"Well, we had a few problems. The situation he's in \u2014 that took everyone by surprise. We had a few issues before with him, even when we were recording it was hard even to get to him to do the recording,\" Young said, sitting in a room with bassist Cliff Williams. \"And then he was supposed to show up to do promos with us, to do video shoots and a few shoots and a few other things, and he never showed up for that either. So, at this stage, it's a pretty tough call for us.\" Rudd, who has been with the band on and off for nearly four decades, was released last week. He is expected to appear in court in New Zealand on Nov. 27. \"We haven't had contact,\" Young said in New York City. \"But he has his people that represent him. He's got himself in a pickle.\" Police had initially accused Rudd of trying to arrange for a hit man to carry out two killings. Police had charged him with attempting to procure murder, which comes with a maximum 10-year sentence; the charge was dropped after a day. Rudd, 60, could face a maximum prison term of seven years for the charge of threatening to kill. Young says AC/DC will continue to promote the album and perform without Rudd, if need be. The band will launch a tour next year. \"We were resolved for us to go forward and I think Phil's got \u2014 it's something he's got to do himself. He's got to sort himself out I think,\" the guitarist said. \"But we were resolved to go forward. So at this point it's kind of a question mark. But if we're touring, there will be a drummer in place, put it that way.\" The Australian band also faced a shake-up in its lineup when 61-year-old guitarist Malcolm Young, who has dementia, announced in September he was leaving the group because of his health. Stevie Young, nephew of founding members Malcolm and Angus Young, played guitar on the band's new album and will join them on the tour. AC/DC also includes vocalist Brian Johnson.

Followed by lunch at Din Tai Fung in Arcadia that includes marinated cucumbers, tapioca cakes and soup dumplings.

It doesn't have to be a full 24-hour day, but we would get together to enjoy the outdoors and cook an early dinner at home. \u201cWe would probably invite a few of our closest friends over, but usually within a two-hour period it ends up being 20 guests. My son Max, who is 20, would start the fire for the barbecue (once a pyro, always a pyro) and my daughter Ida, who is 19, would hopefully set the table. Huge porterhouse steaks on the grill \u201cMaybe we'll grill some great porterhouse steaks and jumbo asparagus from the farmers market. A relaxing day at home with the kids, the dogs, and a nice glass of wine would be the perfect Mother's Day for me. There is one strong request though: absolutely no cell phones at the dinner table.

        "article": "Updated Feb 16, 2013 5:31 PM ET Former Columbus Crew and United States midfielder Robbie Rogers has come out as gay and announced his retirement effective immediately. The 25-year-old American, who played for Leeds United and left League One side Stevenage last month, wrote on his blog that he had been afraid of revealing his sexuality - but that he is now leaving football. Rogers, who won 18 caps for the United States men's national team, wrote: \"Secrets can cause so much internal damage. People love to preach about honesty, how honesty is so plain and simple. Try explaining to your loved ones after 25 years you are gay. \"Try convincing yourself that your creator has the most wonderful purpose for you even though you were taught differently.'' He added: \"Now is my time to step away. It's time to discover myself away from football.'' \"Much love and respect for you,\" tweeted USA forward Herculez Gomez. Women's national team superstar Abby Wambach, Chivas USA's Juan Agudelo and Los Angeles Galaxy defender Omar Gonzalez also weighed in. \"Couldn't be happier for you!\" wrote Wambach. Which American stars abroad shined the brightest in 2012? Find out. Eddie Pope, a three-time World Cup defender for the United States men's national team added: \"Brave men like you will make it so that one day there's no need for an announcement. That day can't arrive soon enough.\" The midfielder has been receiving an outpouring of support from American teammates, players in England's professional leagues, soccer officials and others around the world. While several major individual-sport athletes have been openly gay, no professional athlete in any of the four major North American team sports has come out until well after he was done playing. US women's soccer star Megan Rapinoe came out last year before the Olympics and plays for Lyon in France. Rogers played for the Columbus Crew of MLS from 2007 to 2011, winning the MLS Cup in 2008. For the United States, Rogers made 18 appearances, seven in games that were not exhibitions. He scored two goals, one in a CONCACAF Gold Cup match, and another to give the US a draw in an exhibition game against Mexico. Among those tweeting support to Rogers were many U.S. teammates and U.S. women's players, MLS Commissioner Don Garber, NBA star Steve Nash, Minnesota Vikings punter Chris Kluwe and former England star and broadcaster Gary Lineker. No British-based professional player has come out since ex-Norwich and Nottingham Forest striker Justin Fashanu in 1990. He committed suicide eight years later aged 37. There has been a thawing of attitudes to the prospect of gay players in Britain in recent times, however. Last month, West Ham winger Matt Jarvis became the third footballer to feature on the cover of the UK's best-selling gay magazine, Attitude, after David Beckham and Freddie Ljungberg. Although not gay himself, Jarvis insisted gay footballers should feel comfortable enough to come out. Meanwhile, Clarke Carlisle, the chairman of the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA), said last year he had been engaged in discussions with eight gay players but none of them wished to go public. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

        "article": "Private Lives: Personal essays on the news of the world and the news of our lives. A few months ago, I found myself shifting nervously in the driver\u2019s seat of a parked rental car and avoiding the rearview mirror, afraid I\u2019d catch a disquieting glimpse of my adolescent self glaring back. I\u2019ve never come entirely to grips with him \u2014 or rather, I\u2019ve never entirely forgiven him his lies and his cowardice. And now that I was about to walk into my 20-year high school reunion, his ghost was unbearably palpable. I hadn\u2019t been to any of my previous reunions. For the 15th, I was living overseas; for the 10th, I was still residing part time in a place \u2014 the closet \u2014 that didn\u2019t permit such a winsome excursion into other people\u2019s past. For the longest time, that\u2019s what the memory of my high school years felt like: an era belonging not to me, but to my \u201cnormal\u201d classmates. When nearly every minute of your teenage years is spent scheming and deceiving in a tireless effort to keep others from finding out who you really are, then you become an absent nonentity, a superficial character in someone else\u2019s life story. What right did I have to claim a history in which I wasn\u2019t even present as my true self? By the time I entered high school, being someone else was second nature to me. I was by no means overtly masculine, yet, through sheer genetic luck, I wasn\u2019t \u201cobviously gay\u201d and therefore managed to largely avoid the cruelties inflicted on those who were. What\u2019s ironic is that some of those effeminate boys who were so relentlessly bullied are, today, married to women. They\u2019re still effeminate, but they\u2019re not \u2014 if you take their lives at face value \u2014 gay. Fortunately for me, and unfortunately for my stereotypically \u201cgay\u201d straight classmates, the bigots among us weren\u2019t bright enough to tell the difference. Yet while I wasn\u2019t bullied, I did forfeit my youth to a colorless heteronormative fairy tale. While my classmates experimented with romantic relationships and sex, I avoided making eye contact or brushing elbows with a crush. My most daring moment was scribbling a boy\u2019s name in my notebook, only to hastily scratch it out for fear someone else might see it. I dated girls instead, leaving them to languish in their own self-doubts when, without explanation, I rejected their brave attempts at intimacy. For my senior prom, I drank until I passed out, not to celebrate, but in a deliberate attempt to avoid having to kiss, let alone having to sleep with, my stunningly beautiful date. That was 1993, the year when President Clinton instituted the \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d policy in the military, a credo I hoped those in my personal life would follow, too. Fear. In retrospect, that\u2019s what it all came down to. The fear of being friendless; of fights; of slashed tires and keyed cars; of stares, whispers and epithets potent enough to kill me. \u201cTrust no one,\u201d I reminded myself. Not even the adults: I remember one gossipy high school teacher, glowing in the rapture of a delicious new scandal, sharing a rumor with our class about two boys from a neighboring school caught in flagrante delicto in the baseball dugout. \u201cThat\u2019s nasty,\u201d the girl next to me said. \u201cGross,\u201d hissed the boy behind me. That was the rejection I knew awaited me if I dared to come out of the closet. That was a long time ago, but I\u2019d be lying if I said that the emotional residue was gone entirely. On entering the banquet hall of the suburban country club where my high school reunion was being held, that cowardly, closeted adolescent me had his ears pricked in defense. Yet the next few hours were as pleasant as could be. There were only tepid handshakes, awkward embraces and warm faces massaged by the hands of time. It was hard to believe that these welcoming, down-to-earth adults exchanging business cards before me had inspired such a reign of secret terror in my adolescence. I\u2019d offered my apologies to those I\u2019d misled about my being gay a long time ago in e-mails or phone calls, and many of my former classmates at the reunion already knew my big secret in advance. Most couldn\u2019t care less. \u201cYou should have told me,\u201d my friend Angie said to me after we\u2019d rattled off the list of guys we\u2019d both considered \u201chot\u201d back then and found ourselves strangely in sync with our teenage infatuations. \u201cSeriously,\u201d she went on, \u201ccan you just imagine how much fun we would have had?\u201d I\u2019ve no doubt she means that now, but the reality is that Angie 2013 has as much in common with Angie 1993 as I do with my own cloistered teenage soul. In 1993, Angie was a year away from enrolling in an evangelical college in Missouri, learning, among other biblical tales, about the sins of Sodomites like me. We shouldn\u2019t be content with the way things stand now for gay and lesbian students, but we should be encouraged by the progress made in such a relatively short time. In most places around the country, high school is no longer the pit of despair for gay students that it was when I attended. One of the highlights of that reunion night, in fact, was the conversation I had with our school\u2019s former principal, who, pushing 80, still makes a point of attending as many of these events as he can. He told me that one of his proudest achievements was creating a gay-straight student alliance the year before he retired. \u201cThat,\u201d he said, \u201cI hope is my legacy.\u201d My trembling, cowardly adolescent self instinctively reached out to hug him.

LONDON \u2014 When will this damn rollercoaster ride come to an end? Ever since the end of Game of Thrones Season 5 we've had jumbled reports, theories and clues as to the fate of everyone's favourite bastard, Jon Snow. Although he does appear to be spiralling rapidly toward death in the last episode of the most recent season (and, indeed, in his last section in George R.R. Martin's most recent book A Dance with Dragons), there have been numerous hints to suggest he could in fact be making a comeback: everything from Kit Harington's hair at Wimbledon and an interview the actor did with a Belgian magazine to reports that he's been spotted on the filming set for Season 6. Kit Harington spotted in belfast. Behold. Hes not wearing the black clothes of nights watch. Is he Azor Ahai reborn? pic.twitter.com/8kE9qlykDg \u2014 Jessica Guatato (@_jessicaguatato) September 26, 2015 Now, though, Maisie Williams (who plays Arya on the show) has thrown a massive spanner in the works. During an interview with Absolute Radio on Friday morning, Williams was asked if people constantly pester her about whether Jon Snow is alive. \"All the time,\" she responded. \"People are constantly asking me and the answer is 'no,' I'm very sorry.\" When pressed later in the show, Williams was even more painfully blunt: \"Yeah, he's dead,\" she said. \"I'm not a liar, I'm very sorry. I would know of all people, after all. I'm the one who has the script here!\" Williams went on to explain that she's aware of all the Season 6 storylines as soon as filming begins. \"We get given the full scripts at the beginning of the season and then we can read ahead and see what other people are up to,\" she said. Missed @Maisie_Williams on #CallChristian? Here it is! We're 99% sure Jon Snow is alive. Perhaps. \u2014 Absolute Radio (@absoluteradio) October 2, 2015 So what's the deal? Is Maisie a really good bluffer, or is Jon Snow dead after all? Well there has been a lot of evidence to suggest that Kit Harington is still involved with the show. As well as reported sightings of him on set, he's also been spotted several times in Belfast, where parts of the show are filmed \u2014 but there's always the danger he's only visiting the set to film flashback-style scenes rather than actual look-at-me-I'm-still-alive-after-all scenes. One possible glass-half-full alternative is that Williams was just being careful with her words; it's worth noting that although she was happy to confirm that Snow is dead, she still didn't explicitly say whether he'd be appearing in Season 6, which could leave the door open to a Beric Dondarrion-style resurrection (hinted at in this book passage between Snow and red priestess Melisandre). Basically, we're categorically refusing to give up hope. Have something to add to this story? Share it in the comments.",

        "article": "Walmart wmt has reached an important milestone in using tech to boost sales: the largest U.S. retailer said on Wednesday that its Walmart Pay mobile payment app has now been rolled out to all of its 4,600 U.S. stores. The discount retailer has a lot riding on Walmart Pay\u2019s success: though many thought when the app was announced back in December that it was a tool to compete with Apple apple Pay, the real benefit Walmart is striving for is improved in-store customer experience, reduced hassles at checkout, and getting people to shop more often on its website. Walmart Pay itself doesn\u2019t hold a customer\u2019s payment information, which is kept on his or her Walmart.com account, not the phone. It works with any major credit, debit, pre-paid or Walmart card. Walmart Pay is incorporated into Walmart app, and customers can check out in stores by opening the app and using it to scan a QR code at the payment terminal to speed up the process. Unlike some rivals like Target tgt and CVS Health cvs , Walmart doesn\u2019t have a loyalty program per se. But Walmart Pay is a way to deepen information about shopper habits and, eventually, allow shoppers to do things like build shopping lists based on previous purchases. The roll-out comes at the end of several months of fine-tuning Walmart Pay in stores in Kansas, Arkansas and Missouri. \u201cWe\u2019re building deeper relationships with our customers across our ecosystem,\u201d Daniel Eckert, senior vice president, services, Walmart U.S told reporters on a briefing on Wednesday. He also said that the retailer is already seeing 88% of Walmart Pay transactions come from repeat users, though Eckert said Walmart is hoping to win new customers with the feature too. What\u2019s more, though Eckert wouldn\u2019t disclose how many customers are using the service, he said adoption increased 45% last week, when the rollout was completed, compared to the previous week. So far, the adoption of Walmart Pay is skewing toward young adults, the exact demographic the retailer needs to win over but that is very comfortable shopping at The app is also a way for Walmart to capitalize on a major shift in customer behavior. Forrester Research has forecast that in-person mobile payments by U.S. consumers will go from $3.7 billion last year to $34 billion by the end of 2019. After a long slump, Walmart U.S. comparable sales have risen for six straight quarters, with shopper traffic up for seven in a row. But those gains have been fragile, making the success of Walmart Pay even more important. And better in-store service and experience is essential to that. Eckert wouldn\u2019t say whether Walmart Pay will ever integrate with third-party mobile wallets like Apple Pay, but hinted that would be feasible if desired. (Walmart does not accept the Apple Pay mobile wallet.) \u201cWe built Walmart Pay with flexibility in mind,\u201d Eckert says. \u201cWe continue to have discussions with several third party wallets on how that might unfold.\u201d",

That doesn\u2019t mean he hasn\u2019t had great success in appealing to white Republican primary voters \u2014 there\u2019s no doubt of that \u2014 only that he generally does better in states that have higher percentages of nonwhites, particularly African-Americans. Mr. Trump\u2019s stances on, say, trade and Social Security, can strike a chord with voters. But studies have shown that his bigger appeal is as an authoritarian voice of the voiceless. Part of that dynamic is rallying people \u2014 particularly those who haven\u2019t gone to college \u2014 who feel a resentment toward racial, ethnic and religious \u201cothers.\u201d As Michael Tesler and John Sides wrote for the Monkey Cage at The Washington Post last week: \u201cFifty years of research backs this up. Ethnocentric suspicions of minority groups in general, and attitudes about blacks in particular, influence whites\u2019 opinions about many issues.\u201d Some social science research suggests that the simple fact that President Obama is black might have contributed to a sense of lost power and resentment among whites, and, of course, Mr. Trump first came to political prominence by questioning whether Mr. Obama was even a citizen. An appeal to white identity tends to work better in areas where that identity is felt to be under threat. The South, where Mr. Trump has performed well, has long been known for racially polarized politics. Race essentially predicts political affiliation there, with blacks lining up for Democrats and whites for Republicans. A state like Mississippi, whose population is around 37 percent black, is an obvious example. If even 25 percent of white Mississippians voted for Democrats, the state could tilt blue \u2014 and perhaps elect the state\u2019s first black governor, or first black senator since Reconstruction. Democratic strategists dream of a blue North Carolina and Florida, and further in the future, a blue Georgia or Arizona. But few dream of a blue Mississippi. The numbers have long been locked in. For example, according to the 2012 Mississippi exit polls, 96 percent of blacks voted for President Obama, but 89 percent of whites voted for Mitt Romney, who won by 55 percent to 44 percent. Political scientists have written about the importance of tipping points in ethnic strife or resentment around the globe. It occurs when one group grows big enough to potentially alter the power hierarchy. Mark Potok, senior fellow for the Southern Poverty Law Center, has said that \u201cdemographic change in this country is the single most important driver in the growth of hate groups and extremist groups.\u201d He wrote last month, \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s demonizing statements about Latinos and Muslims have electrified the radical right, leading to glowing endorsements from white nationalist leaders such as Jared Taylor and former Klansman David Duke.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s anti-immigration language lands with force for people who fear the browning of America. Within three or four decades, several reports have indicated, non-Hispanic whites will no longer make up a majority of the United States population. The psychological scientists Maureen Craig and Jennifer Richeson, working at Northwestern, studied whether people could become more politically conservative if they felt a threat to their status in the racial pecking order. In their paper, they wrote that their experiments \u201cprovide striking evidence that perceived group-status threat, triggered by exposure to the majority-minority shift, increases whites\u2019 endorsement of conservative political ideology and policy positions.\u201d What could change this feeling of anxiety and resentment? \u201cIn both experiments,\u201d they wrote, \u201cthe addition of a simple paragraph stating that whites are likely to remain at the top of the future racial hierarchy in a majority-minority America eliminated the conservative shift.\u201d Studies have pointed to other correlations: \u25a0 Robert Putnam, the Harvard political scientist and author, discovered a decade ago that increased diversity in communities is correlated with distrust between and within ethnic groups. (It was perhaps not what he had hoped to find.) \u25a0 Greater racial diversity predicts less of a willingness to build a stronger social safety net: In other words, America would probably have more social spending if it were a whiter nation. \u25a0 One of the bigger predictors of support for Mr. Trump is the belief that affirmative action is taking away jobs from whites and handing them to blacks. \u25a0 Research by the Vanderbilt political scientists Marc Hetherington and Drew Engelhardt has helped shed light on one of the bigger puzzles of this primary cycle: the success of Mr. Trump among evangelicals. \u201cAmong white Southern Republicans, evangelicals exhibit higher levels of racial resentment than do Southern Republicans who are not evangelicals,\u201d they wrote for The Cook Political Report. If you set aside Mr. Trump\u2019s defeat in Texas because it is Ted Cruz\u2019s home state, Mr. Trump\u2019s other losses in states have come in mostly white Iowa, Maine, Kansas, Alaska, Minnesota and Oklahoma. Oklahoma, which is also in Mr. Cruz\u2019s home region, has the highest percentage of African-Americans among those states, around 8 percent, according to the 2010 census. Blacks make up about 13 percent of the United States population over all. Support for Mr. Trump was also probably limited in some of these states because they held caucuses, which tend to favor Mr. Cruz. My colleague Nate Cohn has also identified North Dakota, Utah, Wyoming, Nebraska, South Dakota, Idaho and Hawaii as other unpromising states for Mr. Trump. He narrowly won in Vermont, but the total vote (50 percent) of the establishment candidates Marco Rubio and John Kasich was unusually strong. Also, Colorado would have set up as a perfect state for Mr. Rubio had a contest been held there. Of these states, Nebraska has the highest black population by percentage, at 4.5 percent. An interesting variation is found in Appalachian states like West Virginia and Kentucky, which tend to have small black populations but are still fertile ground for Mr. Trump. Racial polarization in voting there is relatively high, and it\u2019s also a region where racially charged web search are more common. In a Gallup poll this week in which residents of every state were asked if their city or area was a good place to live for racial and ethnic minorities, West Virginia finished last. A map of voting patterns based on racial polarization suggests that Mr. Trump will not be able to mine as much resentment in the West. The industrial Midwest and Northeast, where memories of strife and white flight in urban areas are not that distant, may offer more opportunities. Mr. Trump\u2019s giant victory in Massachusetts is still something of a mystery, but as one reader said, \u201cDon\u2019t forget the antibusing protests.\u201d Marc Ambinder, writing for The Daily News, argued that part of the response to all this should be empathy \u2014 for working-class whites who have been left behind economically and whose resentment has been exploited politically. Consider the most chilling correlation: that Mr. Trump is faring very well where middle-aged whites are dying fastest.",

        "article": "The jubilation and relief that flowed from United Nations climate talks in Rwanda over the weekend may be short-lived in the U.S., where legal experts say the agreement risks being blocked by Republican senators. Weary U.N. diplomats finalized a deal Saturday to phase out the use of most HFCs, which are chemicals used in refrigerators and air conditioners and by other industries. The agreement was designed to accelerate a shift to safer substitutes for some of the world\u2019s fastest growing and worst greenhouse gases. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing an unparalleled momentum to tackle climate change,\u201d said Harjeet Singh, a Delhi-based climate change expert with the nonprofit ActionAid. \u201cThe willingness to act has resulted in an enthusiastic plucking of low hanging fruits. But in order to keep people and the planet safe, we need to reach much further.\u201d The agreement was struck weeks before a more all-encompassing global climate deal, the Paris agreement takes legal force, following its hurried ratification in recent months by President Obama and other world leaders. Global temperatures have risen about 1\u00b0F since the 1800s, with heat-trapping air pollution making heat waves, floods and destructive storms more likely and more severe. The Paris agreement calls on countries to voluntarily reduce their overall climate impacts, focusing heavily on electricity, clean transportation and land clearing. The voluntary nature of the agreement was accepted by other countries in part to help Obama avoid the need for lawmaker approval prior to U.S. ratification of the pact. But American experts on international environmental law say ratifying the new HFC agreement would almost certainly require a two-thirds vote from the Senate. If enough countries formally agree to join, the new agreement could take effect in 2019. \u201cThis is different from Paris, in that it requires ratification \u2014 and that\u2019s concerning to me,\u201d said Michael Wara, and expert on energy and environmental law at Stanford. \u201cThis is going to require getting Republicans to vote for it.\u201d Although past generations of Republican leaders, including presidents Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George Bush Sr., championed environmental laws, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and most Republican senators today oppose efforts to slow global warming. Republicans currently control both chambers of Congress and they have been steadfast in their opposition to nearly all legislation involving climate change. If Trump wins next month\u2019s election, his campaign statements on environmental issues strongly suggest he would not pursue American ratification of the HFC agreement. But even if Hillary Clinton wins, Republicans may yet be able to block America from entering into the agreement. \u201cI worry about her ability to have enough cocktails with enough Republican senators to get this over the hump,\u201d Wara said. \u201cThat\u2019s a heavy lift.\u201d The U.S. State Department, which helped negotiate the HFC deal, is saying publicly that it hasn\u2019t figured out whether the new agreement will require Senate ratification. If America failed to ratify the agreement, it\u2019s hard to predict how the global use of HFCs would be affected, though it may cause the leaders of other countries to balk at the idea of joining the pact, slowing momentum on climate action. \u201cWe will need to examine the content and the form of the agreed amendment, as well as relevant practice, in order to determine the appropriate approval process,\u201d State Department spokeswoman Emily White said in an email on Monday. The agreement reached in the Rwandan city of Kigali on Saturday would expand the kinds of gases covered by theMontreal Protocol. That was a 1987 agreement that helped save the ozone layer by nearly eradicating the use of chemicals called CFCs. Countries and companies often complied with the agreement by switching to HFCs, which are safe for the ozone layer but contribute to global warming. As demand for air conditioners and fridges has been growing, including in rapidly developing countries, HFCs have been escaping into the atmosphere. The HFC pollution has been helping to heat the planet \u2014 further increasing demand for air conditioning. By limiting the use of HFCs, the new Montreal Protocol amendments could reduce global warming by 1\u00b0F by 2100. They could also drive investments in research and development, making alternative products more affordable. \u201cPrices are going to be dropping faster than people expect,\u201d said Durwood Zaelke of the nonprofit Institute for Governance & Sustainable Development. The EPA is working to force American manufacturers to find climate-friendly alternatives to HFCs. The White House has been pressuring world leaders to update the Montreal Protocol to cover climate-changing gases since early in Obama\u2019s presidency. In 2014, India dropped its opposition to using the Montreal Protocol for climate protections, formally embracing America\u2019s proposal, allowing the HFC deal to be struck over the weekend. Under the terms of the new agreement, developing countries like India and Pakistan could take longer to phase out their uses of HFCs than developed countries. If America fails to join the new agreement, developing countries may also be dissuaded from joining, threatening to scuttle its potential success. \u201cThe amendment would, in fact, require a two-thirds vote of the Senate for the U.S. to join,\u201d said University of Virginia professor John Setear, pointing to provisions in the Vienna Convention, a 1961 agreement dealing with treaties that underpins the Montreal Protocol. \u201cThe president is going to have to go to the Senate or face a lot of political heat,\u201d Setear said. \u201cThis amendment has been sold as a climate change measure, not an ozone layer measure. The Senate hates climate change measures.\u201d",

        "article": "The discovery two years ago that the expansion of the universe is speeding up has presented physicists and cosmologists with a major problem. The gravity of all the known matter and energy in our own universe should slow that expansion, not speed it up. Looking for a way out of this perplexity, several cosmologists are now suggesting that the cosmic acceleration may be an effect from some other universe. The cosmologists who have made this proposal concede that it is a radical idea. But in identifying another, or parallel, universe with extra dimensions that may exist beyond our own three spatial and one time dimension, the cosmologists are on the cutting edge of a trend in a branch of theoretical physics called superstring theory. Dr. Andreas Albrecht, a cosmologist at the University of California in Davis, said that all the simple ways of explaining the astronomical observations had already been tried and had failed. ''The data has thrown something at us that's deeply puzzling and doesn't fit very well in any theoretical framework that we have,'' he said. ''We're really venturing out into new territory.'' The new idea comes in two parts, the first of which will be published in the journal Physical Review Letters by Dr. Albrecht and his Davis colleague, Constantinos Skordis. In their paper, they showed that a strange kind of energy named quintessence, which has been posited to permeate the universe, could develop into a repulsive force at certain times, when it would accelerate the cosmic expansion. The second part involves the application of an advanced theory called superstring theory, which portrays elementary particles not as points but as wriggling, incredibly tiny 10-dimensional strings. Many physicists hope superstring theory may one day show the underlying unity of all forces in nature. New work suggests that the ability of some forms of quintessence to flip from an attractive to a repulsive state could be connected to a particularly bizarre and bedeviling prediction of string theory, namely the existence of parallel universes, or equivalently, different dimensions, that can nevertheless exert forces on our own. If that were true, it would turn ''a problem of string theory into a triumphant verification,'' said Dr. Joseph Lykken, a physicist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. As described by Dr. Albrecht and Dr. Skordis, quintessence can be thought of as a weak field of energy permeating space. Such fields are a standard element in the physicist's toolbox and are a common way of describing matter and energy mathematically. According to Einstein's equations of relativity, ordinary matter and energy both exert normal, attractive gravity on each other, but quintessence, if it exists, could also, under some circumstances, exert an antigravity force. The quintessence considered by Dr. Albrecht, like ordinary matter, normally exists in a humdrum, unsurprising attractive mode, and becomes more tenuous in space as the universe expands. ''It sort of shadows the behavior of the other matter,'' Dr. Albrecht said. But in its calculations the team discovered that any slight change in how the quintessence is thinning out could temporarily shift the gravity of the quintessence from normal to repulsive. The switch would mean that the quintessence would stop slowing cosmic expansion and start accelerating it. ''It can change its behavior due to little imperfections in its behavior, which would lead to acceleration,'' Dr. Albrecht said. Just what could cause such a bump in the cosmic road, the scientists did not say. The string research suggesting just how all of this might happen has not yet been published, but has been presented at conferences by Nima Arkani-Hamed, Lawrence Hall, Hitoshi Murayama and Chris Kolda at the University of California in Berkeley. In superstring theory, different vibrations of the strings in 10 dimensions represent particles that carry all the known forces in the universe, including gravity. But string theorists have long wondered what to do with the extra six dimensions that we do not perceive in our four-dimensional universe. If we do not see them, where are they? One solution is to ''compactify'' them, or make them very small and imperceptible. But some theorists have recently considered the effects of making the extra dimensions larger. The extra dimensions in the Berkeley theory would still be much smaller than an atomic nucleus, but larger than compactified dimensions. Dr. Arkani-Hamed and his colleagues have uncovered the astonishing fact that stringy forces between some of those other dimensions and our own could fill the universe with a kind of energy -- a quintessence -- much like the one proposed by Dr. Albrecht and Dr. Skordis to explain the acceleration. ''Quintessence is a very ghostly thing,'' but it could be created by the interdimensional force, Dr. Arkani-Hamed said. The model could even account for the bumps, he added. New theories of those extra dimensions consider that they have a finite size, and when the other universe hits the end of the line, the quintessence could change its character. To be taken seriously, the new suggestion would have to undergo observational tests. Dr. Albrecht said that it may leave a signature on the afterglow of the Big Bang, called the cosmic microwave background, but that such subtle features had not been observed with present instruments. Still, cosmologists are happy to find even a small ray of light shining on a problem that has left them feeling benighted. ''This is starting to look like real physics,'' Dr. Lykken said.

        "article": "I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t put much past politicians. I stay prepared for the worst. But occasionally someone says something so insensitive that it catches me flat-footed. Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, said Sunday on Fox News: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI do support unemployment benefits for the 26 weeks that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re paid for. If you extend it beyond that, you do a disservice to these workers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This statement strikes at the heart \u00e2\u0080\u0094 were a heart to exist \u00e2\u0080\u0094 of the divide between conservatives and liberals about whether the social safety net provides temporary help for those who hit hard times or functions as a kind of glue to keep them stuck there. Whereas I am sure that some people will abuse any form of help, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m by no means convinced that this is the exclusive domain of the poor and put-upon. Businesses and the wealthy regularly take advantage of subsidies and tax loopholes without blinking an eye. But somehow, when some poor people, or those who unexpectedly fall on hard times, take advantage of benefits for which they are eligible it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an indictment of the morality and character of the poor as a whole. The poor are easy to pick on. They are the great boogeymen and women, dragging us down, costing us money, gobbling up resources. That seems to be the conservative sentiment. We have gone from a war on poverty in this country to a war on the poor, in which poor people are routinely demonized and scapegoated and attacked, and conservatives have led the charge. They paint the poor as takers, work averse, in need of motivation and incentive. Well, that is simply not my experience with poverty. I have been poor, and both my parents worked. I grew up among poor people, and almost all of them worked. The problem wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t lack of effort, but low pay. Folks simply couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make enough to shake the specter of need. In fact, the poor folks I knew growing up were some of the hardest working people I have ever known \u00e2\u0080\u0094 rising before dawn to pack lunches and sip coffee, trying to get the mind right for a day of toil and sweat that breaks the body but not the spirit. They were people who wanted what most folks want \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to earn an honest wage for an honest day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work; to live a happy, meaningful life that leaves a mark on the world when they are gone from it; to raise bright, healthy children who go further in life than they did; to be surrounded by family and friends and neighbors \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a village \u00e2\u0080\u0094 where people support and cared for one another. That is why I have such a hard time with the conservative argument that helping those in need diminishes their desire to do for themselves, that it suckles them to passivity on a government teat. Hogwash. To buy into this destructive lie about the character of the poor means you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve either had no experience being poor, or have no capacity to empathize with their plight. Being poor is a job unto itself. The daily juggle of supplying the most basic needs \u00e2\u0080\u0094 food, shelter, medicine \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and the stress of knowing that you are always just one twist of fate away from calamity. James Baldwin put it best: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnyone who has ever struggled with poverty knows how extremely expensive it is to be poor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Most people want to work. But sometimes, bad luck comes calling. Sometimes you have a job, but you lose it. Sometimes, no matter how hard you try, a new one proves elusive. And following the Great Recession, that is a particular problem. Maybe you are older and employers are less willing to take a chance. Maybe your industry is shrinking and becoming more efficient, getting by with fewer employees. Maybe the jobs you can find are farther from your house than you can travel and you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t afford to move. The problems are plenty. But what we shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do is to tell people who had jobs and lost them, people who want work and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find it, that to help them does them a \u00e2\u0080\u009cdisservice.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That is the height of arrogance and callousness. And it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disrespectful.",

And they got rewarded with three of 'em No, the Phils arren't the Braves. They have a lot more problems. Rollins (probably) and Ibanez (certainly) will leave. Howard now has a major injury and his stats were already showing some decline from fabulous to merely wonderful. Utley's knee problems appeqar to be chronic so I doubt he'll ever be 100% of the player he was at his best. Polanco has had a terrible post-season career, which he continued. Is Oswalt really an \"ace\" any more. For the previous seven years his average fastball was, each year, between 92.6 and 94.0. In '11, it was down to 91.4. And he really pitches off that fastball. The Phils bullpen is okay for a contender but worrisome for a team that wants to be great. And what's Manuel's future? One loss can set a franchise back a knotch. Halladay, Lee and Hamels will keep them >90 wins. But I suspect their very best years are past. Doesn't mean they can't put it together for another WS win. But five more years? No. I wanted to make a point about clutch hitting in the post-season. Almost NOBODY hits better in October because the pitchers you face are better. If you hit the SAME in October, that's very good. And if your OPS only falls 50 points, that's okay. But there are people who, over many series, have an OPS that's >100 points lower. Some examples. Ryan Howard (46 games, 10 post-season series): .845 OPS. Career: .928. That's a solid Oct record. Utley (same 46 games): .902 vs. ,882 career. !!! Rollins (46 games): .686 vs .761 career. Victorino (46 games): .784 w 30 RBI vs .783 career. He really steps up in October. Talking to him by the cage before playoff games, he just seems to love it, want to play up to the moment and enjoy it. A rare great attitude.) Polanco (38 games): .592 (awful) vs. .752. Ibanez (36 games): .656 OPS vs. .813. Ugly. Hamels 13 starts 7-4, 3.09 ERA vs 3.39 career era. Halladay 5 starts, 3-2, 2.37 ERA. Oswalt (eight series) 5-2, 3.73 ERA. Career ERA 3.12. Finbally, A-Rod is poor, but doesn't quite stink w a .260 average in post-season as a Yankee. Jeter's post-season OPS is .839 in 7000 games vs .832 in career.

Why me? I am not a therapist; I've never even played one on TV. Most of you know me as an actor. Some of you may have read my books (I've written a couple) and a select few of you may have heard me sing jazz. (If you've done all three, bless you. If I could, I would knit you a tea cosy.) That's the other thing, I'm American. I drink coffee rather than tea, which is only one of the ways in which we are different. Yes, we speak the same language, but in other ways we don't at all. Once, the actor Robert Lindsay, with whom I acted in a film, thought he was complimenting my sister by saying she had a \"homely\" face. I thought he was calling her ugly and was furious, until everyone on set convinced me otherwise. Half the time, in my own life, I feel like I don't know what I'm doing. I make mistakes. Big ones. But I muddle through the best I can and try better the next time. Many of your struggles mirror my own, and the advice I will offer will be what I could have used myself. I've been told, on occasion, that I'm not always the best at taking advice, which is what really makes me the most qualified; I'm great at giving it. Dear Molly,My circle of friends is generally wealthier than me (I'm a single teacher; they're not). They're all going on holiday, and have offered to pay for me. I don't feel comfortable accepting, but I hate the idea of being stuck at home. Is it a bad idea to go? Dear Teacher,There is no free lunch, nor is there a free expensive holiday. In fact, there is no free anything. While there is nothing inherently wrong with accepting your friends' hospitality, don't kid yourself: there is a cost. Whether it's feeling obliged to be entertaining the entire time, or being expected always to \"volunteer\" to clean up, or just having to come up with sufficient displays of gratitude \u2013 it's hard to say what the expectation is without knowing your friends. It's also hard to say whether the emotional cost will outweigh your enjoyment of the holiday. Another thing to keep in mind is that group vacations can be surprisingly stressful, even when everyone is paying their share. Throwing together, in an unknown place, a bunch of people who then have to negotiate all their meals and activities and travel can cause friendships to disintegrate (although it can make for compelling reality TV). Your discomfort is a big warning to think carefully before accepting. There will naturally be an imbalance of power, and this will continue after the holiday has ended. Only you can know what is more valuable: your equality within the social circle or a week by the beach sipping frozen cocktails. \u2022 Send your dilemmas about love, family or life in general to askmolly@theguardian.com",

Few people can fathom how the city came apart in the floodwaters, how the police and other authorities struggled to bring order back in the midst of an apocalypse. \"My wife and daughter don't want to know anything about what went on, and I think the reason is they don't want to believe,\" he says. \"Well, I think they believe it, but they don't want to hear about it. Some people don't want to believe something like this could happen in a major city in the United States -- that it could come to this.\" \"And what did it come to?\" I ask, hoping to capture a sound bite that sums it all up. \"Kate, you know,\" he says. But I don't know, and it's frustrating. On September 11, there was no gray areas. There were heroes and villains and innocent civilians. It happened on one day in one place, with cameras and voicemail recording it all. In New Orleans, the water drowned all the evidence, the lights went out, and nobody -- not even heroes like Hearty, who rode into town to save people -- got out with a clean conscience. \"You know what the marks mean on the house, Kate? Possible body,\" he says. \"I hate to say it, but you can smell 'em. They probably came by and smelled it, but there was so much debris and they couldn't enter, so they put on possible body.\" We walk past workers who are cutting up a barge -- the officers call it \"Noah's Ark\" -- that broke through the levee and is parked on a city block. The same rush of water caused a five-house pile-up nearby. \"Now it's been six months, and it's still like this. It's amazing,\" he says. The first time I met Hearty -- two weeks after Hurricane Katrina -- he wore combat boots and carried a machine gun. His mustache was black, and he was quiet. I was intimidated. But on this day, the day after Mardi Gras, Hearty wears civilian clothes. He's just one of hundreds of thousands of people who lost everything last August. He says before the storm his life was in great shape. He was going to work until August of this year at a sugar refinery, retire and join the New Orleans Police Department full time. The house was almost paid off. \"And then in one day's time it was gone,\" he says, \"Everything.\" Now, he can joke about his situation. \"It's not too bad, 'cause I live in a trailer down by the river, and I'm happy with it,\" he says, referring to his FEMA-supplied temporary home. As I ride around with Hearty, I begin to get some perspective. He points to a school. \"This is where some of them were holed up. They had some good people in there, but the criminal element, you know, was in the school.\" Federal law enforcement agents and some officers from Texas \"went in and cleaned them out,\" Hearty says. \"At least that's what my friend in the Fifth [District] told me, 'cause I asked him exactly what happened there.\" It is another secondhand story about violence after the storm -- violence that was either overblown by the media or under-reported by law enforcement. I was starting to become more obsessed with setting that record straight: How badly did things fall apart after Katrina? In the First District, Hearty says there were 24 rounds fired around the station on the first Tuesday after the storm, and that on the following day, \"there were various shootouts, looters going into the stores, burning the stores.\" (Watch police describe man who fired shots at station -- 1:32) \"And we had wondered why other districts had pulled back, but the First District stayed,\" he says. His unit was a buffer zone between two projects, he says. Hearty and a small group of other officers calling themselves \"River Rats\" -- without any guidance from their commanders -- went out to look for boats and tried to rescue people. On the fourth night, they came across a balcony full of children who wanted to be evacuated. \"It was actually in the project area, which is dangerous in and of itself, and to take and lower these children into the boat was dangerous,\" he says. They had to go back to get a second boat so they could get all the children out at the same time. A captain saw the men and said there had just been a shooting in one of the projects. \"And he says, 'It won't do any good for you to go back because if you get shot, they'll have the boat and the children won't get saved.' \" So a frustrated Hearty went back to the station and eventually fell asleep with his guilt in his Isuzu Trooper. On the fifth day, help arrived from outsiders. Hearty is still angry at the federal government for its slow response, but he's harder on himself. While he was rescuing people in New Orleans, his dad had to be rescued by his nephew. \"I didn't know if he was dead or alive,\" he says. All of the choices, the ambiguous situations, the thin line between hero and coward have taken a toll on Hearty. As he sits in front of his trailer in St. Bernard's Parish, he looks at me and says, \"Don't ask me how morale is.\" So Katrina's burden is now on me and I have to make choices about whose story gets in the documentary and whose gets cut, whose pain and which injustice gets air time. We have a less than an hour. Hearty's story of conflicted heroism gets cut from the documentary for time. I, too, have to wonder if I left the wrong person behind.",

        "article": "There is a show about an obese woman on TLC that has such cultural significance that anyone in our modern society would benefit from watching. For starters, it's hard not to fall for , is downright lovable. First a YouTube sensation for her viral , she is whip-smart, funny, open and kind, but at 380 lbs., she also represents something that does not exist on reality TV: A fat person who is truly happy with herself, just the way she is. Thore, 30, spoke to PEOPLE about life as a newly minted reality star \u2013 whose show was renewed for a second season, we have learned exclusively \u2013 the biggest misconceptions about her (no, she's promoting obesity) and how she learned to accept herself. Any fat person who's just living and not miserable is apparently promoting obesity! If I'm pro-anything it's simply pro-loving yourself in this moment because it's all we have. And I want to lose weight. I'm not na\u00efve to the health risks that are going to come to me at almost 400 lbs. But does that mean I'm going to hate myself in the process? No. People seem to think that as I go about my daily life, just living and existing, that I'm trying to get some reaction out of people. When I'm at the beach, people say, 'Well Whitney, of course they're going to call you Shamu, you're putting yourself out there, you're asking for it.' No, I'm living like every other person on this beach. And what's the alternative? I'm going to sit in my house? I think people are very threatened by happy fat women. We have an idea that thinness leads to happiness. But to see a fat woman living her life and being happy in the moment now, I think people feel slighted: 'Well, she just cut in line! I've been buying gym memberships and starving myself and buying wrinkle creams and who is to get to feel happy?' And I'm like, 'No, sister, jump outta line. You can do it too.' No. I am totally about personal responsibility. My initial weight gain in college was 100 lbs. in eight months. I absolutely blame that on PCOS. It happened out of nowhere, I had no control over it. But since then, of course, I've continued to gain weight. What made me fat was a combination of PCOS and the shame and the stigma that you face being a fat woman in America. When I gained weight, did I want to leave my house? No. When I walked to the gym and people called me a fat ass, did that make me want to go work out? No. Did I want to take really good care of myself? No. But if anybody thinks that I just blame the fact that I'm 380 lbs. on PCOS, that's clearly wrong. Whitney Thore and Todd Beasley in My Big Fat Fabulous Life I've lost a little bit, and I have been working on eating better \u2013 that's my biggest challenge because I love exercising. It's not that I eat really unhealthy all the time. I've had eating disorders when I was younger. I am definitely focusing on getting a plan in place but it's got to be something that's more sustainable. When I lost 100 lbs. [two years ago], I became totally obsessive. I was eating 500 calories a day sometimes, and I was purging, too. And I'm proud to say that I haven't engaged in any disordered eating behavior in two years. That's big for me because that's lasted my whole life. When I lose weight this time, I want it to stay off. I only have a goal of 100, maybe 150 lbs. I'm okay with being fat for the rest of my life as long as I'm healthy and happy. Lord, no. It was actually always not this way, even when I was thin. I can't even explain it, I just feel liberated now. Like I broke out of a prison. I made the viral video when I was 350 lbs. I said, I'm just going to do it. I'm just going to dance anyway. And that's all I ever had to do, I just didn't know it. For 10 years when I was fat I was able to project a happy face, but I was absolutely miserable. Up until two years ago it was, 'I gotta lose weight, I gotta lose weight,' in a panic almost. This idea that life can't start until I'm thin. Life won't be what it should be until I'm thin. And I don't believe that any more. I always cringed at my body, no matter what size it was. Now, the only reason I want to lose weight is for health and lifestyle. I am happy in my body as it is right now. But if my stomach gets any bigger I won't be able to bend down and tie my shoes. I love to be active, I like to dance. So for me to live my most fulfilled life, I need to drop 100 lbs. But I honestly love the way that I look. I look at myself naked all the time and I'm like, all right, sister, that's what it is. For me, confidence is a product of action. It's not like you have a certain amount that you're born with, it's something you have to work on every single day. People have it backwards. They think, 'I've got to have the confidence to do it,' whatever 'it' is. But I don't think that. I think, just go do it, and then it's okay. I mean, how often do we do something and think, 'Why didn't I do that 10 years ago?' I hear from just as many anorexic women as I hear from fat women. This is a universal problem about being a woman \u2013 it's not exclusive to fat people. We're indoctrinated from a very young age that thinner is better, that we can always be skinnier. That the worst thing you can be is fat \u2013 especially if you are a woman. I hear from people dealing with society-induced shame, people with chronic illnesses, mental illnesses, disabilities. I heard from a boy in Lebanon, this one just killed me: He's 16 and he wrote to me and said, 'I'm gay, and it's illegal to be gay here. But I watched your videos and I feel like my life can be okay.' I mean, I can't even. [ ] I don't go read the negative stuff, and not because it hurts me personally. It doesn't. I hear so much positive, and I think the world is changing and things are getting better so I choose to just focus on the positive. But can't nobody touch me. I have the most amazing family and friends. I'm happy for the first time in my life. My Big Fat Fabulous Life My Big Fat Fabulous Life: The Skinny",

        "article": "Stacy Sodolak for The New York Times Mark Simmons, an ecologist on the Mueller Prairie project. More Photos \u00bb WITH 70 days of 100-plus temperatures so far and no rain in sight, Austin is in the grip of its worst one-year drought on record. And gardeners are quickly finding out which plants can survive brutal heat and drought. Native trees like cedar elms and hackberries are dropping their leaves. Ash junipers in the Hill Country are dying. Shallow-rooted azaleas and crape myrtles are toast, and most lawns are brown, except for those watered by private wells. Animals are suffering, too. Coyotes and rabbits are showing up in city gardens in search of water and food. Hummingbirds can\u2019t find nectar because many plants aren\u2019t flowering. The first week of August, when daily temperatures climbed to 107 or so, a bison escaped from a ranch in Manchaca, on the southwest side of the city, and wandered into the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center seven miles away, where it spent several days grazing in the savanna grasslands. Gardeners are embracing those prairie grasses with equal enthusiasm because of their heat and drought tolerance. These natives can be found in many of the city\u2019s lawns, ornamental gardens and even green roofs. Remarkably, these deep-rooted plants can adjust to shallow soils, helping to cool houses and absorb rain \u2014 when there is some. \u201cIf we get a rain, these grasses will all turn green,\u201d said Lars Stanley, 59, an architect and metal artist, standing on a roof planted with natives that covers the studio he built in East Austin with his wife, Lauren Woodward Stanley, 45, an architect. \u201cIt reduces our cooling level immensely.\u201d The grasses (blue grama, curly mesquite, little bluestem and sideoats grama) go dormant in a drought, a survival strategy that keeps their roots alive. But the prickly pear and Texas sedum the Stanleys planted, succulents that store water in their fleshy pads, looked remarkably fine. A plain black-tar roof can heat up to 170 to 200 degrees, Mr. Stanley noted. The plants on this roof, rooted in five inches of a stony mix that includes crushed decomposed granite, perlite, lava rock, rice hulls and a dash of compost teeming with micro-organisms, \u201cshould knock that temperature down 100 degrees,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they have to be green and evapo-transpiring to do that,\u201d Ms. Stanley added. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to water them in the midst of a drought.\u201d With its reservoirs half-empty and tributaries down to a trickle, the city is rationing water. And the Austin Water Utility is offering rebates of up to $5,000 for installing residential rainwater collection systems. When it does rain here, it tends to pour, sheeting across hard surfaces and dry lawns to storm sewers. So the more rain that is channeled into tanks or slowed by porous driveways and terraced gardens, the better for the land, as well as the water table, because plants will filter pollutants before sending water on to underground springs and tributaries to the Colorado River. On the roof over the Stanleys\u2019 studio, rainwater is channeled down a wide gutter that feeds into one of four 1,500-gallon tanks on the two-acre property. \u201cWe use the condensate from our air-conditioning also,\u201d Mr. Stanley said. \u201cIt fills up a five-gallon bucket every two days, which adds to the tank.\u201d Other designers, like Christine Ten Eyck, a landscape architect, are replacing asphalt driveways and other hard surfaces with permeable ones, like gravel or crushed granite, and replacing lawn with terraced beds filled with plants that not only can take heat and drought but also absorb and hold water. \u201cI\u2019ve done it passively, instead of actively with a cistern,\u201d said Ms. Ten Eyck, 52, standing by the live oaks in front of the 1950s bungalow in West Austin that she shares with her husband, Gary Deaver, 65. \u201cThe whole idea was to slow the rainwater down, because we\u2019re about eight feet higher than the street.\u201d",

        "article": "As Americans begin to decide how to vote in 2016, one of the many questions they are asking is: how well is the Affordable Care Act working? The natural inclination is to look backwards\u2014to judge whether the ACA has measurably improved the health care system in the last 6 years. Here, the answer is clearly yes. Nearly 19 million people have gotten insured. And health care inflation has been lower than at any time in the last 50 years, although drug costs are going up faster. Not bad. A better way to evaluate the ACA is to look forward\u2014to assess whether the law is setting the framework for a higher quality and lower-cost system. The best window on the future is the health care start-up sector. These are the companies that will shape the care we all receive in the next decades. And the picture provides good reasons to be optimistic. Overall, 2015 was a record year for medical investing, including in biotech companies making new drugs. But it was also a record year for investing in start-ups aimed at improving quality or reducing costs. In 2011, just after passage of the ACA, about $1.1 billion was invested in \u201ctechnology-centric, health-related companies that facilitate healthcare administration, delivery, or access.\u201d In 2014 and 2015, that figured skyrocketed to over $4.3 billion. Where is all this money going? A lot of it is going where you might expect: new apps and technological innovations to deliver care more efficiently. There are many companies, for example, devoted to scaling up telemedicine so that patients can see their doctor without going into the office. Others are working to improve medication compliance with new gadgets like \u201csmart\u201d pill-bottle caps. Still others, like Omada Health, are using gamification and virtual communities to promote diet, exercise and health living among the chronically ill. But, perhaps surprisingly, many of these start-ups are working to redesign and reimagine parts of the health care system that already exist but aren\u2019t working well or have been long ignored. Many Americans are already familiar with Oscar, the irreverent, insurance start up targeting hipsters in New York and now Los Angeles and Texas. But in Colorado, there is also Bright Health Plan, a start-up picking up the pieces of the state\u2019s co-op to launch a low-cost, narrow network health plan. Similarly, several companies have dedicated themselves to modernizing primary care practices by using big data. VillageMD is currently operating in Houston, Indiana and New Hampshire, soon to be in Ohio and Illinois. They provide physicians with data on their patient panels and builds support teams that include pharmacists, nurse managers, and care coordinators, all focused on coordinating care and improving patient results. A team of clinicians make home visits on high-risk patients. While pharmacists do home delivery of chronic medications with medication reconciliation at time of delivery. The physicians have data not only on their own performance but also on the specialists and hospitals they use, helping them identify the highest quality and lowest cost specialists to use. Village MD has been able to raise primary care physician salaries, which helps attract more into the area. Another example is Aledade, which has organized over 500 primary care physicians in 11 states with 80,000 patients. The company claims lots of improvement in vaccination rates, preventive services, 24/7 access that have reduced emergency room use to 6% and hospitalization rates by 4%. There are a string of new companies working to improve another problem area: mental and behavioral health. Lantern provides patients with customized assessments in laymen\u2019s terms and offers tailored online programs such as cognitive Behavioral Therapy. Ginger.io links people to a coach and if necessary a licensed therapist. Quartet is trying to bridge the gap between mental health care and primary care. For patients, it utilizes a set of online assessment and diagnostic tools to determine appropriate referrals and deploys online counseling which is has proven more beneficial than many anticipated. For therapists, Quartet provides treatment guidelines matched to proven therapeutic interventions, and uses phone-based reminders and other techniques to reduce the extremely high rate of no-show patients that exacerbate a universal problem of scarce therapist appointments. Still, others are rethinking traditional care using the Uber model. One company, Dispatch, is developing technology that allows patients to call for emergency room-level care in their homes so that they avoid expensive trips to the hospital. Another company, Aspire, with the guidance of former Senator and physician Bill Frist, is trying to identify terminally ill patients and connect them to a nurse practitioner trained in palliative care. The goal is to treat their symptoms and provide counseling in order to keep patients symptom free, out of the hospital, and at home with their families. Preliminary evidence suggests they cut hospital admissions by as much as 50%. The ACA is also unleashing a flood of talented entrepreneurs into health care. As venture capitalists endlessly repeat, when it comes to new companies, \u201cpeople are everything.\u201d Entrepreneurs who used to go to traditional Silicon Valley start-ups focused on search, shopping, sharing, and software are now migrating to health care. David Ebersman, the former chief financial officer of Facebook, has a new health care start up. Jini Kim, who was an early Google employee, created Nuna health and along the way, she was one of the six Silicon Valley techies who saved healthcare.gov in November and December 2013. Nat Turner and Zach Weinberg created an advertising start up for You Tube in their University of Pennsylvania dorm room and sold it to Google googl . In 2012, they created Flatiron, a company that provides a user-friendly electronic medical record specifically for oncology. The company also mines the data to help drug companies streamline identification of patients for clinical trials. Lots of other senior executives with no or limited health care experience from Yammer, Reputation.com, Yahoo yhoo , IDEO, and other companies have come into health care. Undoubtedly, there will be booms and busts. Many of these start-ups will fail. Few will become $1 billion unicorns. But the amount of creative energy entering the health care space is a good sign that the ACA created predictability that is necessary for investors, and incentivized innovation to reduce costs and increase quality. Like all the activity that brought us Google, Facebook fb , Amazon amzn , and the others, this activity offers a good reason to be optimistic about the future of health care in the USA. Ezekiel J. Emanuel is an oncologist and Chair of the Department of Medical Ethics and Health Policy at the Perelman School of Medicine at University of Pennsylvania. He served in the White House, helping craft the Affordable Care Act. Emanuel is also a part- time venture partner with Oak HCFT that has investments in several companies referenced in this article, including Village MD, Aspire and Quartet.",

        "article": "Pres. Obama addresses gay activists Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama, speaking to a gathering of gay and lesbian activists, said Saturday that he is committed to equality, citing the repeal of the military's \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy as an example. Obama said his accomplishments on gay rights issues have been substantial since he last headlined the annual National Dinner of the Human Rights Campaign, in 2009. He acknowledged \"we have more work to do,\" including on the issue of bullying. The president currently supports same-sex civil unions, and has said his views on gay marriage are \"evolving.\" He recently announced his support of the Respect for Marriage Act, a bill that would repeal the Defense of Marriage Act, a 1996 law that defines marriage as between a man and a woman. Organizations working actively to legalize same-sex marriage say they hope Obama eventually changes his stance. While Obama spoke Saturday about equality, he did not speak on the marriage issue. The president chided participants in a Republican presidential debate last month for not rebuking members of the audience who booed a gay soldier who asked about the repeal of \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell.\" \"We don't believe in standing silent when that happens,\" Obama said of the debate incident. \"You want to be commander-in-chief, you can start by standing up for the men and women who wear the uniform of the United States even when it is not politically convenient.\" After the debate, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum said he hadn't heard the booing when the question was asked. Santorum was being asked the question when the incident occurred. Obama spoke of growing tolerance measured, he said, by ordinary Americans: \"A father realizes he doesn't just love his daughter but also her wife.\" Joe Solmonese, president of the Human Rights Campaign, said after the speech that Obama reaffirmed commitment to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans. \"It was a remarkable experience to see openly gay and lesbian uniformed service members in the audience be able to salute their commander in chief\" about the repeal of \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell.\" Obama's remarks were delivered to a key constituency that hasn't always been receptive to the president's policies and style of leadership. \"I'd like to see the president bring his message of support for the freedom to marry to a broader audience, perhaps in a conversational setting, so that all Americans can hear him talk about why marriage matters to loving gay and lesbian couples and their families,\" said Evan Wolfson, the founder and president of Freedom to Marry. \"It is important that the president lay out the case for Americans opening their hearts to the values of fairness and treating others as they would want to be treated.\" Wolfson, along with other organizations advocating for legal same-sex marriages, said the Obama administration had made significant progress on some issues, but that support for marriage equality was still an important goal. \"We applaud the administration's progress, while we also encourage him to 'evolve faster' on supporting full marriage equality,\" Stuart Gaffney, media director for Marriage Equality USA, said Saturday. He said he wasn't aware of any opposition within his organization to the HRC's selection of Obama as their keynote speaker. \"We look forward to the day soon when our president stands with that pro-equality majority,\" Gaffney added. The Log Cabin Republicans, an organization that represents gay and lesbian conservatives, said Obama's appearance Saturday night was more about politics than substantive policy change. \"President Obama's appearance at the Human Rights Campaign Dinner this evening is more emblematic of their role as an ostensibly partisan organization than a representation of the gay and lesbian community,\" said Christian Berle, the group's deputy executive director. Berle said Obama's stance on gay marriage didn't match that of most Americans. \"As all Americans are becoming open to marriage equality, the president is taking a retreat,\" Berle said. \"Instead he is turning to the gay community for money and applause. \"If the president wants to deserve all the money and adulation he has already received from the gay community, he should announce his firm support for everyone's freedom to marry,\" Berle said. Saturday's event was expected to draw 3,000 gay activists, and took place at a convention center in downtown Washington. The speech was streamed live online. A CNN/ORC International poll taken Sept. 9-11 showed 53% of Americans believe marriages between gay and lesbian couples should be considered valid. That number has steadily been rising in CNN/ORC International polls since 2008. CNN's Athena Jones contributed to this report.",

        "article": "Citizens Bank, one of the largest regional banks in the country, was hobbled for hours yesterday by a major computer outage that disrupted everything from online banking to teller operations to automated teller machines in Massachusetts and other states. Citizens Bank blamed the outage, which began early yesterday morning, on a \u2018\u2018technical glitch,\u2019\u2019 but offered few details. Many customers couldn\u2019t withdraw money from ATMS, access accounts online, or make deposits at branches. The bank said the problems were mostly resolved by 4 p.m., except for some lingering problems with the website. The bank said some customers were still having trouble accessingaccounts because of a surge of people trying to sign in at once. \u2018\u2018We apologize to our customers for the inconvenience,\u2019\u2019 said Citizens Bank spokesman JimHughes. He did not say what time the outage began or what caused the problem. Citizens is the latest large bank to experience technical problems that disrupted services. Recently, customers of Bank of America, the nation\u2019s largest bank, had trouble accessing online banking over six days. Wells Fargo & Co. of San Francisco had at least two major ATM outages earlier this year, one in February and another in April. But it is unusual for banks to have a broader outage, such as the one Citizens experienced yesterday, affecting everything from ATMs to teller operations, said Rodney Nelsestuen, seniorresearch director for the Tower Group, a Boston financial research firm. Nelsestuen said he suspects that Citizens either had a problem with its data network or its core computer systems. Nelsestuen said such a widespread outage has the potential to seriously damage a bank\u2019s reputation if not corrected immediately. But he said customers are likely to be forgiving if it lasts only a few hours and doesn\u2019t recur. \u2018\u2018If it doesn\u2019t last very long,\u2019\u2019 Nelsestuen said, \u2018\u2018and they don\u2019t have another problem, most customers will have forgotten about it\u2019\u2019 within a few months. The Providence-based bank, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland, has 1,500 branches in 12states. The bank is second only to Bank of America in branches in Massachusetts. Bruce Pomfret, an information technology manager from North Andover, said he repeatedlyhad trouble logging on to his account yesterday, preventing him from checking his balance. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s fairly frustrating,\u2019\u2019 said Pomfret, who works for a health care insurance firm. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s kind offunny not being able to see your balance with a couple of key strokes.\u2019\u2019 When Sean Devine, a Web designer from Pittsburgh, couldn\u2019t log on to his checking accountyesterday morning, he worried that his paycheck wouldn\u2019t automatically be deposited into hisaccount, causing payments to his cable company and other firms to be rejected. \u2018\u2018This is crazy,\u2019\u2019 Devine said. \u2018\u2018I need to straighten this out. It\u2019s really a hassle.\u2019\u2019 But at 1:30 p.m., Devine said, he was able to get online and saw that his direct deposit had gone through.

        "article": "NEW JOB: Rushing in Control Room EXCLUSIVE: Josh Rushing, star of Control Room, talks about his new job Posted Tuesday, Sep. 27, 2005 Josh Rushing, former Marine captain and an accidental star of the movie Control Room made news of his own last week when he signed on to become the American face of the controversial Arab news network Al Jazeera-International. Top U.S. officials, including Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, have repeatedly complained that Al Jazeera's coverage is unfair or untrue. Yesterday, Rushing sat down with TIME for his first interview on why he took the job and what the new network will cover. The 33-year old Rushing came to fame in Control Room, a movie critical of media coverage of the Iraq war as a military public affairs officer who increasingly questions how the war was being portrayed by the Pentagon. In the movie, Rushing is articulate and passionate in defending the troops and never directly criticizes the war. And his honesty draws viewers to his side\u0097he describes his different reactions to seeing on Al Jazeera images of Iraqi casualties one evening and dead U.S. soldiers the next. \"It upset me on a profound level that I wasn't bothered as much the night before,\" Rushing explains at one point in the movie. \"It makes me hate war. But it doesn't make me believe we can live in a world without war yet.\" He admits\u0097then and now\u0097to being troubled by the \"politicization\" of the military command and what he describes as U.S. TV networks being \"co-opted\" by the Bush Administration. One reason he wanted to leave the Marine Corps, says Rushing, is that his superior officers had forbidden him to speak to the press. He was torn between his loyalty to the Corps and his duty as a citizen. \"I felt like I had a platform and something to say. I thought it would be a missed opportunity to say, take a public relations job in Houston, which I was about to do.\" The journalists at Al Jazeera-International, says Rushing, are a mix of nationalities and most in the Washington Bureau come from established outlets like CNN, BBC, Britain's ITN and even Fox News. Rushing thinks that diversity will be part of Al Jazeera-International's appeal. \"I'm an American and proud of it. If that affects my objectivity, then so be it,\" said Rushing. Rushing will be based in Washington for Al Jazeera, which is backed by the government of Qatar and headquartered its the capital, Doha. Al Jazeera-International, which Rushing compares to the international versions of CNN and BBC, plans to start broadcasting in the U.S. in the spring of 2006. Rushing will likely do set pieces on issues, interviews and perhaps even have a 30-minute international affairs show. The format is still being finalized, but Rushing knows who he considers models: NBC's Tim Russert and Bob Costas, and National Public Radio's Terry Gross. The target audience, Rushing says (while recording our interview on his iPod) is global, English-speaking and owns iPods\u0097 people who have turned off the TV news in favor of the Internet. Rushing says he looked into the accusations about Al Jazeera distorting the news, and found nothing to stop him from joining. \"I'm not condoning everything they do but the Arab media is a key part of national security and how to deal with Arab world. The network has long been the only one in the region with a point-counterpoint approach, where many others are 'point-point-point.' Al Jazeera, for example regularly has Israeli spokespeople on.\" Rushing says the State Department and Pentagon have both shown interest in working with the new network. Rushing thinks part of his mission is to educate the American public on the reality of war. \"War in America has its own branding\u0097it's the American flag, it's that Lee Greenwood song, it's a sailor kissing a woman in Times Square. But Americans need to be aware of the consequences.\" Like it or not, \"Al Jazeera is the most influential Arab voice outside of mosques. It is the largest shaper of ideology,\" says Rushing. And if American voices are not heard in that venue, then they have no chance of having virtually any influence. \"I've dedicated my adult life to the health and security of the United States and to representing the best of American ideas. I will maintain my credibility by continuing to do that.\" Rushing may discover that being a Marine might have been the easy part.",

        "article": "Marilyn Beck, a widely read newspaper columnist and broadcast figure who helped introduce a style of impartial journalism to the celebrity gossip beat, died on Saturday at her home in Oceanside, Calif. She was 85. The cause was lung cancer, said Stacy Jenel Smith, Ms. Beck\u2019s writing partner in her last decades. At their peak in the 1970s and \u201980s, Ms. Beck\u2019s syndicated columns reached 20 million readers in hundreds of newspapers, including The Daily News in New York. She was also a familiar presence on radio and television, hosting \u201cMarilyn Beck\u2019s Hollywood Outtakes\u201d specials on NBC and long-running stints on the syndicated \u201cPM Magazine\u201d and on the E! Channel\u2019s \u201cGossip Show.\u201d Ms. Beck was among the first Hollywood journalists to have an online presence in the late 1980s, eventually starting her own website with Ms. Smith. Ms. Beck bridged two eras in Hollywood journalism \u2014 between the gossip columnists of the 1930s and \u201940s like Louella Parsons and Hedda Hopper, who derived power from their studio connections, and a generation of reporters who came along after the death of the studio system. Ms. Beck forged most of her connections directly with the people she wrote about. In the 1960s and \u201970s, her straightforward style earned her the trust of many celebrities with stories to tell. Elvis Presley gave her his first interview after being discharged from the Army in 1960. Dick Van Dyke publicly revealed his struggles with alcoholism in an interview with her. And before supermarket tabloids got wind of it, Michael Landon told Ms. Beck about his dependence on prescription pills. She could be as tough as a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d cross-examiner \u2014 questioning Sylvester Stallone and Clint Eastwood about leaving their wives; pressuring Bob Hope to talk about his money; digging up celebrity culture dirt in 1976, after the singer Claudine Longet was charged in the shooting death of her boyfriend, the skier Spider Sabich. She could also be as fawning as \u2014 well, a celebrity gossip columnist. In one of her biggest scoops, Ms. Beck was invited to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, in 1963 to interview a Hollywood couple whose romance was the celebrity scandal of its day, both partners being married to others at the time. \u201cElizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton have discovered paradise \u2014 and they freely admit it,\u201d she wrote on Nov. 11 from a remote Burton-Taylor redoubt. \u201cIn this tiny tropical village they have found their heaven on earth, where they can openly display their love for each other, freer than they have ever been from notoriety and criticism.\u201d Ms. Beck had never intended to be a gossip columnist, she told interviewers; but having found herself in the job, she embraced it without pretense. \u201cThe day of the wicked whisper is passed,\u201d she said in a 1969 interview with Editor and Publisher magazine. \u201cBut gossip based on fact will continue as long as there is a Hollywood. Gossip is news.\u201d She was born Hanna Marilyn Mohr in Chicago on Dec. 17, 1928, and raised in Los Angeles. She graduated from the University of Southern California with a degree in journalism, then married Robert Beck, a Los Angeles newspaper reporter, and had two children. She and Mr. Beck later divorced. When her youngest child was in grade school, Ms. Beck began writing freelance articles for local newspapers and fan magazines. She became a Hollywood columnist for the Bell-McClure syndicate in 1967. Ms. Smith was in her early 20s when she teamed up with Ms. Beck in the late 1970s, working alongside another young reporter assistant, Ms. Beck\u2019s daughter, Andee (who went on to become a television critic in Oregon). Ms. Beck\u2019s columns were carried by The New York Times Special Features syndicate beginning in 1972 and by the Creators syndicate from the 1990s onward. The column, \u201cHollywood Exclusive,\u201d is now written by Ms. Smith. She is survived by her second husband, Arthur Levine; her daughter, Andee Beck Althoff; a son, Mark Beck; a brother, Mitchell Mohr; and four grandchildren.",

        "article": "The days of over-sized jeans sagging from the derrieres of men everywhere are no more. Skinny jeans, tailored pants, and fitted oxfords are de rigeur, leaving little room for excess fabric in the undergarment department. Boxers or briefs used to be the only question men needed to ask themselves, but today, the options have grown. Five years ago, Tom Patterson was a medical-device sales rep by day and an avid-viewer of CNBC\u2019s The Big Idea with Donny Deutsch by night. \u201cAll of the featured products or services \u2026 were created out of personal frustration,\u201d recalls Patterson. \u201cI found myself constantly looking around, asking, \u2018What can I make better?\u2019\u201d During the financial crisis, Patterson was laid off from a sales job he held for six years. During his down time, he realized that one of the biggest fashion annoyances he faced while he was working was a fabric gut \u2014 that baggy bump just above the belt line caused by a loose-fitting undershirt. After researching fabrics and designs of the bestselling undershirts at high-end department stores, Patterson came across micro modal. The patent-pending fabric is soft, with properties similar to cotton, but it doesn\u2019t shrink or yellow as easily. \u201cI headed to my dry cleaner\u2019s with a design and paid him $100. Then ordered 15 more, asking trusted friends to wear them and give me feedback.\u201d With positive reviews in hand, Patterson moved to San Diego with his girlfriend, locked down a manufacturer, and founded Tommy John. Today, the three-year old company offers its wares at stores like Saks SKS , Neiman Marcus, and Nordstrom jwn . Revenue over the past year was $1.5 million, up from $900,000 in 2010; Patterson predicts that 2012 revenue will be between $4-6 million. And this week, the company launched a new underwear line for men at Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom. \u201cWomen\u2019s underwear is like the Jetson\u2019s. It\u2019s futuristic, innovative,\u201d says Patterson. \u201cBut men\u2019s hasn\u2019t been modernized at all.\u201d His company\u2019s brief line has a \u201cQuick Draw\u201d fly, which is horizontal rather than vertical, a ventilation zone, and no-rise legs. The fabric also allows stretching that keeps the briefs from riding up the wearer\u2019s thighs. \u201cMost guys have to wear different pairs at work and at the gym. These can be worn in both settings \u2014 and even have a pocket for your iPod,\u201d Patterson says. Patterson doesn\u2019t want to stop at underwear. Indeed, he is looking to tackle other men\u2019s intimates, like socks and robes. He wants his customers to deviate from the time-honored replenishment model \u2014 buying new underwear to replace the old. Instead, he aims to encourage men (or women) to buy because they want the product, or need it with a certain outfit. Tommy John is not alone in its quest. Industry giant Jockey is also changing their underwear game with a new \u201cStay Cool\u201d line featuring Denver Broncos quarterback Tim Tebow as its spokesman. \u201cGuys are starting to look for functional benefits in underwear,\u201d says Jockey Chief Marketing Officer Dustin Cohn. The company\u2019s \u201cstaycool\u201d line has some of the same breathable features NASA astronauts enjoy in their space suits. \u201cI think guys are catching up to women in intimates. Women are thoughtful about their clothes and what intimates make them look best. Men are becoming thoughtful, too.\u201d Cohn says Tebow was an ideal face for its new line, arguing that he appeals to both men and women. \u201c[Tebow] is an authentic and honest athlete, appealing to the guys. The women like his personality and good looks.\u201d With its large consumer base, Jockey certainly wouldn\u2019t mind seeing the replenishment model fade. In recent years, men\u2019s fashion in general has undergone a significant shift, says Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst at consumer market research firm The NPD Group. \u201cOver the past two years, men have become more concerned with fashion than they have been in several decades \u2014 since the \u201870s.\u201d Today, Cohen says, men\u2019s products are being designed for specific applications. \u201cMale consumers are being told this is the style and this is the product you need for X activity.\u201d Cohen cites Under Armour UA as a good example of a brand that has done a good job avoiding the typical undergarment business model. As for smaller companies like Tommy John versus behemoths like Jockey, Cohen argues that there\u2019s room for both. \u201cThere are two windows of opportunity in the market. Be unique and different and market to a higher-end customer. Or be so unique and different that consumer\u2019s recognize and want your brand.\u201d So is a Victor\u2019s Secret in the offing? Cohen says we shouldn\u2019t hold our breath, adding that the men\u2019s intimates market, while growing, is still half the size of the women\u2019s market. To be sure, men\u2019s underwear is leaving its Stone Age. And small companies like Tommy John should not be taken lightly. \u201cDo I think a small player with a lot of innovation could make an impact on the market? Yes.\u201d",

        "article": "New Brunswick has secured $230 million more for health care from the federal government over the next decade, Premier Brian Gallant announced today. The bilateral deal \u2014 the first reached since talks between federal and provincial governments broke down earlier this week \u2014 includes funding for home care and mental health, he said at a news conference in Fredericton. It represents an estimated annual increase of 4.1 per cent \u2014 \"the middle ground\" between the 3.5 per cent that the federal government had been offering and the provinces' counter-offer of 5.2 per cent. \"Today's agreement ensures that we can receive funding for home care and mental health this spring that might otherwise have been delayed or lost,\" said Gallant. The signed health accord also includes a clause that if any other province or territory reaches a better deal, New Brunswick could choose to adopt those terms, he said. \"NB chooses to accept reduction of fed funding from 23,3% to 20% but also rely on other provinces to fight for a better offer,\" Quebec Health Minister Ga\u00e9tan Barrette promptly posted on Twitter. Earlier at the news conference, Gallant lashed out at Barrette, saying he was \"flabbergasted\" by his criticism of New Brunswick in the media. \"I can just not even imagine the ramifications of one of my colleagues or myself telling [Quebec] how to do health care and telling them how to navigate the federal government,\" said Gallant. \"I couldn't even fathom it.\" Federal Health Minister Jane Philpott described the agreement as \"very good news for the people of New Brunswick.\" Under the deal, the annual Canada Health Transfer payments to the province will increase by three per cent per year or the rate of national GDP growth \u2014 whichever is higher. It's estimated to be worth $1.2 billion over the 10 years. It will provide $125.1 million for better home care, including addressing critical home care infrastructure requirements, and $104.3 million in support of mental-health initiatives. As a result, the number of patients in hospital who could be better cared for at home or in the community is expected to be reduced, and the wait times for mental-health services for children and youth are expected to be \"shortened considerably,\" according to the federal government. \"I want to thank Premier Gallant and our provincial counterparts in New Brunswick for their vision and leadership,\" Philpott said in a statement. The two governments will continue to work over the coming weeks to develop performance indicators and mechanisms for annual reporting to citizens, as well as a detailed plan on how the funds will be spent, the statement said. Earlier this week, Gallant announced negotiations were already underway for a bilateral health funding deal between New Brunswick and Ottawa after the broader federal-provincial discussions collapsed on Monday. \"We're in talks,\" Gallant said in a year-end interview Tuesday with CBC News. \"There's nothing official yet, but talks are going well. We are hopeful that we will get a deal that will represent our realities here in New Brunswick.\" Federal health and finance ministers failed to reach an agreement with their provincial and territorial counterparts Monday because Ottawa wanted to tie home-care and mental-health money to specific targets. Ottawa was offering a 3.5 per cent general increase each year for five years as well as additional money for those two areas, but it wanted the provinces to agree to report to the federal government on how the additional money was spent. The provinces refused to sign on to that condition and asked for a meeting of premiers with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Finance Minister Bill Morneau declared the talks a failure, and said the offer of home-care and mental-health money was no longer on the table and that the Canada Health Transfer spending increase will revert to three per cent a year as of April 1.",

        "article": "F. Gilman Spencer, who was known for his freewheeling style and sharp eye for writing talent as the editor of four newspapers, including The Philadelphia Daily News and The Daily News in New York, died on Friday in Manhattan. He was 85. The death was confirmed by his son F. Gilman Spencer IV. Mr. Spencer, known as Gil, worked in the newspaper business for nearly half a century. Starting out as a copy boy for The Philadelphia Inquirer in the 1940s, he went on to edit The Trentonian in New Jersey and The Denver Post, in addition to the Philadelphia and New York newspapers. While editor of The Trentonian, he was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for editorial writing in 1974 for a series of articles on government corruption in New Jersey that led to the federal prosecution of a number of officials. Mr. Spencer was known for spotting talent and promoting it in his pages. At The Philadelphia Daily News, he decided that Pete Dexter, an obscure reporter, would make an excellent columnist. He did, and later went on to write a column for Esquire and establish a career as a novelist. After becoming editor of The Daily News in New York in 1984, Mr. Spencer helped the careers of Juan Gonzalez, Bob Herbert, Mike McAlary and Gail Collins, whose columns he often placed in the front pages to maximize their impact. Mr. Herbert and Ms. Collins later became columnists at The New York Times, and Ms. Collins was editor of the Times editorial page. \u201cHe had an amazing instinct for what people were good at and letting them do it, and knowing how much leash to give them,\u201d said Richard Aregood, who was an editorial writer and rock critic at the Philadelphia paper when Mr. Spencer put him in charge of the editorial page. \u201cHe left the same trail from Trenton to Philadelphia to New York to Denver.\u201d At The Daily News in New York, where he was responsible for the editorial pages as well as the news pages, Mr. Spencer brought a feistier, flashier style and a carnivorous appetite for reporting on city politics and corruption as the newspaper mounted a head-to-head battle for readers with The New York Post. \u201cWe want to put out a hard-driving, down-to-earth tabloid and enjoy ourselves doing it,\u201d he told The Times in 1986. Arthur Browne, the city editor of The Daily News at the time and now its editorial page editor, said: \u201cHe worked at a tabloid, but he did not like frivolous silliness. He insisted that the paper not take itself too seriously but that it be a serious newspaper.\u201d The Daily News was owned then by the Tribune Company, which had been trying, without success, to sell it. Mr. Spencer sought to combat the mood of crisis and impart a sense of purpose and buoyancy, which he managed to do at his first meeting with the newsroom staff. \u201cIt\u2019s like watching Jimmy Stewart play a newspaper editor in \u2018It\u2019s a Wonderful Life,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Browne recalled telling a fellow editor at the meeting. Mr. Spencer often clashed with The Daily News\u2019s publisher, James F. Hoge. In 1989, before the Democratic mayoral primary, he strongly opposed Mr. Hoge\u2019s wish to endorse Mayor Edward I. Koch, a favorite target of the newspaper\u2019s columnists, preferring David N. Dinkins. In the end, the newspaper endorsed Richard Ravitch. Soon after the primary election, which Mr. Dinkins won, Mr. Spencer resigned. At the time, he said his decision was motivated by impending negotiations with the newspaper\u2019s labor unions that would have required him to make a long-term commitment to remain at The Daily News. He was hired almost immediately as editor of The Denver Post, from which he retired in 1993. Frederick Gilman Spencer III was born on Dec. 8, 1925, in Philadelphia, where his father was a lawyer. He attended Swarthmore High School but did not graduate. After serving in the Navy during World War II, he was hired as a copy boy at The Inquirer and held a variety of reporting and editing jobs at The Chester Times in Pennsylvania; The Mount Holly Herald in New Jersey; The Main Line Times of Ardmore, Pa.; and The Philadelphia Evening Bulletin. He worked in television in the mid-1960s as a writer and editorialist at WCAU, then the CBS station in Philadelphia, before becoming editor of The Trentonian, a tabloid, in 1967. He received the 2003 George Polk Award for career achievement. In addition to his son Gilman, of Media, Pa., Mr. Spencer, who lived in Manhattan, is survived by his wife, Isabel; three daughters, Amy Becker of Media; Elizabeth Mergel of Dorchester, Mass.; and Isabel Spencer, known as Charlie, of Amherst, Mass.; another son, Jonathan, of Pennington, N.J.; 10 grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.",

        "article": "Scientists have deciphered the genetic blueprint of South Africa's Archbishop Desmond Tutu and an indigenous Bushman from Namibia as part of an ambitious and controversial project to bring modern genomic medicine to the developing world. An international team of researchers decoded every gene of the Nobel Prize-winning anti-apartheid leader and an elderly man named !Gubi, a member of a hunter-gatherer society from the Kalahari Desert. They also cracked the main parts of the genetic codes of three other hunter-gatherers from the Kalahari, whose language consists of a complex arrangement of clicks. The results, published in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature, are the beginning of a program designed to enable researchers and drug companies to use the most advanced molecular tools of modern \"personalized medicine\" to help people of all ethnicities and societies. Until now, most of the genomes decoded have involved Europeans. \"The benefits of personalized medicine should be extended to indigenous peoples around the world,\" said Stephan C. Schuster, a professor of biochemistry and molecular biology at Pennsylvania State University, who helped lead the effort. The publication of individual human genomes is highly controversial. Only a handful of genomes have been made public, including that of James Watson, who co-discovered the structure of DNA with Francis Crick. Some researchers and advocates for indigenous people said they were worried whether all participants understood the full implications of making their genomes public. The findings could be used against them, denying them claims to property and leading, theoretically at least, to workplace and insurance discrimination or even more sinister ends. \"We're worried how this material will be used,\" said Pat Mooney, executive director of the ETC Group, a nonprofit advocacy group based in Ottawa. \"Will it just be for historic information? Or is it going to turn eventually into profitable products or even dangerous products that could be harmful for these peoples, such as special ethnic bombs?\" An early analysis of the genomes has identified 1.3 million genetic variations that had not previously been found and could lead to important insights, including how to better tailor drugs to people living in southern Africa, the researchers reported. Some AIDS drugs, for example, are less effective in Africans than Europeans, Schuster said. The analysis has produced tantalizing clues to human evolution. The indigenous people, who are believed to represent the oldest lineage of modern humans, are much more genetically diverse than other populations. They also have genetic variations that might explain their unusually good senses of hearing, vision and smell, physical prowess and enhanced ability to taste bitter, all of which would have evolved to enable them to survive by living off the land. \"They need[ed] to make a living by hunting animals. You have to be very good with long runs and pursuing the wild animals they were preying on. This is all reflected in the genes we find,\" Schuster said. Other researchers praised the work. \"I think it's a very exciting paper,\" said Sarah Tishkoff, an associate professor in the departments of genetics and biology at the University of Pennsylvania. \"Africans have not been well represented in genomic and human genetic studies.\" Some maintain it is a crucial step for medicine to advance. \"It is nice that a very significant fraction of the genomes that are being done are identified individuals rather than anonymous,\" said George Church, a professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School who started the Personal Genome Project to encourage people to publish their genomes. \"I think it's increasingly important both for medical and nonmedical studies.\" Schuster said the project went through numerous reviews by independent authorities in every country involved before going forward. He said he hoped Tutu's prominence as an advocate for indigenous people will encourage others to follow. Knowing Tutu's medical history -- his bouts with polio, tuberculosis and prostate cancer -- will allow researchers to explore those diseases in southern Africans. \"Overall, modern humans from all different regions of the world are all very similar to one another,\" Schuster said. \"At the same time, it is important that we understand those differences that are relevant to medical treatment.\"",

        "article": "The Republican Party came to life as the bastion of \u201cFree Soil, Free Labor, Free Speech, Free Men.\u201d It was a reformist party dedicated to stopping the spread of slavery and to fighting a \u201cSlave Power\u201d its founders saw as undermining free institutions. The new political organization grew out of the old Whigs and reflected the faith that Henry Clay and his admirer Abraham Lincoln had in the federal government\u2019s ability to invest in fostering economic growth and expanding educational opportunity. Its partisans embodied what John C. Calhoun, slavery\u2019s chief ideological defender, described disdainfully as \u201cthe national impulse.\u201d It was, in fact, a good impulse. But the Republicans who held their first national convention 160 years ago were more than just Northern Whigs. Their ranks also included many former Democrats who shared a fervor for the anti-slavery cause and helped take some of the Whiggish, elitist edge off this ingathering of idealists and practical politicians. \u201cThe admixture of Whig and Democratic politics inside the Republican Party,\u201d writes historian Sean Wilentz in \u201cThe Politicians & The Egalitarians,\u201d his recently published book, \u201ccreated a forthright democratic nationalism, emboldening the federal government, for a time, at once to stimulate economic development and broaden its benefits.\u201d The Republicans descending on Cleveland would thus have every right to insist that all Americans owe a large debt to the GOP. We are a better, freer and more prosperous nation because their party was born. Kayla Epstein explains what the heck is going on at the 2016 RNC. (Peter Stevenson,Dani Johnson/The Washington Post) Of course it would be historically naive to pretend that time has stood still since 1856. To do so would mean ignoring that the South, which hated the original Republicans, is now the dominant force in the party. It would involve being blind to the way in which our two great political parties have switched sides in how they view the capacity of our federal government to promote a more inclusive prosperity. It would be equally untrue to history to claim that the nativism of Donald Trump is alien to the party. On the contrary, the anti-immigrant, anti-Catholic Know-Nothings were an important force in early Republicanism, and the party embraced opposition to newcomers at various points in subsequent eras. Nonetheless, Republicans who are not in the least progressive have reason to mourn what is likely to come to pass this week: the transformation of the Party of Lincoln and Dwight Eisenhower into the Party of Trump. Some are bravely resisting this outcome to the end \u2014 and good luck to them. A fair number of leading Republicans have stated flatly that they will never vote for Trump. Their devotion to principle and integrity will be remembered. But so many others in the party have found ways of rationalizing support for a man who plainly does not take governing, policy or even what he says from one day to the next seriously. It is comical but also embarrassing to watch politicians and consultants fall all over themselves to declare that Trump is \u201cmaturing\u201d because every once in a while, he reads partisan talking points off a teleprompter. This is seen as a great advance over the normal Trump, whose free-association rants refer to his opponents as \u201clyin\u2019,\u201d \u201ccrooked,\u201d \u201csad,\u201d \u201cweak,\u201d \u201clow-energy\u201d and \u2014 in the very special case of Sen. Elizabeth Warren \u2014 \u201cPocahontas.\u201d Liberals have long complained about conservatives \u201cdog whistling\u201d appeals to racial animosity. But hypocrisy really is the tribute vice pays to virtue and so it does mark a decline in simple decency that Trump has shouted out his prejudices openly: falsely claiming that Barack Obama, our first African American president, was not born in the United States; railing against Mexican immigrants as \u201crapists\u201d; and calling for \u201ca total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\u201d And a party that helped build popular support for internationalism after World War II is about to turn to a man whose foreign policy pronouncements defy coherence. He\u2019s not even consistent in supporting noninterventionism or protectionism, both of which are part of a historically legitimate Republican tradition. He substitutes bullying for choosing, bluster for strength. Many Republicans oppose Trump because they see him as the one candidate most likely to lose to Hillary Clinton. But others fear something worse: a Trump victory. They know that his presidency would represent a grave danger to the republic, a repudiation of the most noble Republican aspirations, and the end of their party as a serious vehicle for governance. The GOP can survive a Trump defeat. It will never get over being permanently defined by his politics of flippant brutality. Read more from E.J.

        "article": "Paris St.-Germain took a star-studded lineup to the Mestalla to face Valencia in their Round of 16 Champions League match last Tuesday. The former Serie A stars Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Ezequiel Lavezzi and Javier Pastore tormented the Spanish team\u2019s defense throughout a 2-1 victory. It was another player, however, one who formerly plied his trade in Italy, that caught many eyes. Marco Verratti marshaled the midfield for P.S.G. with his pinpoint passing and precise tackling all over the field. An Italian international, Verratti was imperious throughout his debut in the knockout rounds of the competition. His absence through suspension for the return match will certainly rank closely to that of Ibrahimovic (who is also suspended) in terms of importance after the display. Before his Champions League effort, the 20-year-old Verratti spared the Italian national team\u2019s blushes and a sixth successive friendly defeat with an excellent late strike against the Netherlands on Feb. 6. In so doing, he staked his claim for a starting place in the team with the Confederations Cup on the horizon in June. His unstoppable rise from the peninsula\u2019s third tier to the pinnacle of European soccer only looks set to continue. The playmaker made his name during his hometown club Pescara\u2019s Serie B victory last season, which set off the subsequent summer-long race of Europe\u2019s top clubs to secure his signature. His remarkable range of passing as the fulcrum in midfield during the title run led the Delfini faithful to nickname him Il Gufetto di Manoppello \u2014 the Owl of Manoppello \u2014 for his vision in the middle of the park. Verratti\u2019s pinpoint passing exploits began to attach attention from a much earlier age, however. Milan offered him a place in its academy after a daylong trial in 2007, yet the teary 14-year-old decided to stay put in Abruzzo. \u201cMy only focus was to break into Pescara\u2019s first team,\u201d he later said, after what proved to be an inspired choice, since it gave him the necessary time to develop at his own pace. In the two years after his near-move north, Verratti became central to Pescara\u2019s plans. The club was struggling financially during his breakthrough season, and was forced to resurface under a new name. It contrived to achieve promotion from Lega Pro to Serie B that year in spite of its issues, and with Eusebio Di Francesco on the bench the club even managed to consolidate a place in Italy\u2019s second division. Verratti was deployed as a No 10 throughout his young career, but the arrival of recently departed Roma tactician Zdenek Zeman in the summer of 2011 saw him shifted to a deep-lying role in order to facilitate the Czech\u2019s attacking formation. Verratti excelled in his new position as a regista, and in an incredible campaign pulled the strings in midfield to exploit the finishing prowess of Ciro Immobile and Lorenzo Insigne. Zeman\u2019s approach of all-out attack ran the opposition into the ground, and the Delfini netted an unprecedented 90 goals in 42 matches to gather attention from all over Europe. Comparisons with the Juventus playmaker Andrea Pirlo began to litter any conversation about Verratti. The composure both men demonstrate on the ball, and the manner in which they consistently find space deep in their own half to control games was frighteningly similar. Their arrogance to attempt passes the majority of players could not even fathom also excited Italian supporters. Cesare Prandelli latched on to Verratti\u2019s abilities at the back end of the Serie B campaign, and he included him in Italy\u2019s preliminary squad for the 2012 European Championships. He ultimately did not make the final cut for Poland and Ukraine, but the intent was there to guide him into Prandelli\u2019s team. \u201cI am living a neverending dream at the moment,\u201d Verratti said. Speculation about Verratti\u2019s future plagued the Delfini soon after, with Juventus the early leader to secure him as an understudy to Pirlo after it was revealed that Verratti had been a Bianconeri fan as a child. Negotiations involving Juventus representatives and the newly promoted team\u2019s president, Daniele Sebastiani, proved lengthy, but without any solution. Paris St.-Germain fended off the competition to add to their Italian contingent by signing Verratti for $16 million in July. The promising youngster was forced to settle into life in the French capital alongside a host of marquee names despite never playing in a top flight. The move sparked outrage up and down the Italian peninsula, as one of the country\u2019s most promising youngsters was \u201cexported.\u201d \u201cNobody believed in the boy,\u201d his agent Donato Di Campli said. \u201cMarco transferred abroad because the fact is nobody in Serie A believes in youth anymore.\u201d The simple fact was the no club could afford to take a risk on such a perceived luxury. Lured to Paris by the presence of a countryman, Carlo Ancelotti, patrolling the sideline at the Parc des Princes, it was believed Verratti would be integrated into the team gently. Impressive displays in Ligue 1 early on, however, turned him into a mainstay in the midfield. Despite his being replaced for a short period by another fellow countryman, Thiago Motta, Verratti has become virtually indispensable to P.S.G. The issue of homesickness during his Milan trial more than six years ago has disappeared, and he has fit into life in Paris seamlessly. The doubts that Verratti\u2019s move was premature have subsided, and with every passing week he is establishing himself on the European stage. The \u201cnext Pirlo\u201d tag may also be shifting as he form his own unique habits and looks to permanently etch his name into Italy\u2019s starting lineup.

        "article": "PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti \u0097 With chilling regularity, a pickup truck from the Haitian police or a taxi driver with a station wagon pulled up to deliver more bodies to the morgue. Flies buzzed on many of the bodies. Civil servants unloaded the cargo, their expressions hidden by white surgical masks. Hundreds of bodies, those of adults and children alike, were already piled outside the morgue, bloated under the blazing sun. Relatives picked their way around them trying to find the missing, trying to block out the putrid smell. \u201cThey took away my daughter, finally,\u201d said one stunned man, Roilin \u00c9lys\u00e9e, 58, who had watched men in a Nissan pickup with the word \u201cPolice\u201d painted on its side collect her body from in front of the French Embassy on Thursday. \u201cI do not know what is next for her body.\u201d For many Haitians like Mr. \u00c9lys\u00e9e, it was better not to think about what lay ahead. \u201cI\u2019m trying to find my brother,\u201d one dazed man said as he stared at the pile of bodies. \u201cBrother!\u201d he cried a few times. A man dressed in white wandered among the onlookers, repeatedly shouting into a loudspeaker, \u201cGod is coming back!\u201d But the grim pileup of bodies all but masked one positive note: Haiti\u2019s barely functioning state had begun to work, if still just minimally, by sending the police to gather bodies. The police pickup trucks were virtually the first organized recovery efforts seen in many parts of the city. The residents of Port-au-Prince, the capital, also began taking responsibility for cleaning up on Thursday: clearing streets, collecting debris and searching for trapped survivors. \u201cI heard several of my co-workers are alive some place inside there,\u201d said Pierre Ricky Constant, 24, an inspector who showed up Thursday morning, wearing a motorcycle helmet and armed with a tire jack, to start digging through the rubble of the Transportation Ministry building, where he worked. \u201cTell President Obama we need his help,\u201d said Mr. Constant before beginning his search of the ruins with a few colleagues. Next to Mr. Constant\u2019s ministry it was a similar story. The Ministry of Finance: destroyed. The Ministry of Justice: destroyed. The Fire Department: destroyed. To get on with the task of picking up the pieces, the living literally still had to step over the dead on this city\u2019s streets. Even as the police picked up what bodies they could, others that were shrouded in white sheets or that had been simply dragged outside without any covering lined the sidewalks. A block from the crumbling presidential palace, close to the morgue, a group of about 10 young men ran toward a reporter, yelling: \u201cHey! Food! We are hungry! Do something!\u201d Doing anything remained a logistical nightmare. Electricity remained nonexistent. Gasoline remained in short supply. Thousands remained camped in parks, in the street, under trees. One of the biggest such camps was in the park of Champs Mars near the presidential palace. \u201cMy home and my store are destroyed, so we are staying here,\u201d said Deliverance Sanveur, 49, a shop owner who was staying under a sheet in the park with 15 of her relatives. Still, nothing approached the misery in front of the morgue, which is almost adjacent to the general hospital. Outside the hospital, the wounded waited patiently for treatment. Those who died during the wait were simply dragged next door to the morgue. In the waiting area for those about to die, one woman moaned, her leg severed at the knee. An elderly woman gargled blood. Several people, hardened already to such suffering, walked by. Among the bodies that had been moved a few feet over to the morgue, it was rare to find any that were identified. Someone wrote the name \u201cEvise Melus\u201d on a piece of paper and tied it with a rubber band to one woman\u2019s right toe. No one working on the corpse detail could say where, or how, Ms. Melus would be buried. One morgue worker was pouring a concoction that looked like blue laundry detergent on the smelliest bodies. \u201cI will not go near that morgue,\u201d said Georges Michel, 55, a historian who spent part of Thursday driving around the city taking in the scenes of destruction and despair. \u201cThe lucky ones are those buried in their own yard,\u201d he said. \u201cFor those less fortunate, they will join the other corpses in forming mountains of the dead.\u201d",

        "article": "Ko Sasaki for The New York Times A community center serving as a makeshift shelter in Ofunato, Japan, on Wednesday. OFUNATO, Japan \u2014 For the past five days Takiko Kinno has slept on a crowded gymnasium floor, without electricity or running water and living on food rations that in the beginning amounted to one and a half rice balls per day. But the toughest part, she says, has been the uncertainty about how long she will have to stay here after last week\u2019s tsunami destroyed much of this small port city in northern Japan. \u201cWe are stuck in limbo,\u201d said Ms. Kinno, 69, who shares the gym with 500 other residents, most in their 60s or older. \u201cWe don\u2019t know where we will live, how we will live, how long it will take to leave here.\u201d It is a predicament shared by tens of thousands across northern Japan. In stricken communities like this one, tsunami refugees have gathered in hundreds of schools, hospitals and public gyms that have been converted into makeshift shelters. In Ofunato, with a population of 41,000, there are 61 such shelters housing 8,437 people, officials said. Shelter residents often live in desperate and primitive conditions with little more than a roof over their heads. They have endured days of living in the dark and cold, an ordeal made even worse on Wednesday as a winter storm brought heavy snow and below-freezing temperatures to many devastated areas. The privations underscore the difficulties that Japan has faced in responding to the 700,000 refugees created by Friday\u2019s earthquake and tsunami, the nation\u2019s largest humanitarian crisis since World War II. While national news media and opposition politicians have been quick to criticize Prime Minister Naoto Kan\u2019s handling of it, at least some residents said they had low expectations of the central government to begin with. \u201cThe central government has a big debt, no money, so we can\u2019t rely on it,\u201d said Noriko Kikuchi, 71, in Ofunato\u2019s gym. But some help is finally starting to trickle in, usually in the form of food and water brought by Japan\u2019s military, after many shelters were cut off from the rest of the world in the first days after the disaster. At the gym in Ofunato, four portable toilets arrived a day ago to supplement the two over-used restrooms. A cheer went up in the early afternoon when electricity was partly restored, giving the refugees their first electric light since the waves hit. Those living there say they still face severe shortages. They say they have not bathed or changed their clothes in five days \u2014 and for Japanese, who look forward to a nightly ritual of immersion in a hot bath, that is particularly distressing. For many, their clothing was all they brought with them as they fled, leaving them essentially marooned in the shelters because they had no money to hire a taxi or shop. The waves swept away everything else they owned, and in many cases their savings as well, because many older Japanese keep their savings in their dressers, not a bank. Those who have bank accounts could not withdraw money because power problems froze A.T.M. networks. \u201cI would leave tomorrow if I could,\u201d said Emi Sasaki, 64, a homemaker living at the gym with her daughter and granddaughter. \u201cAccess to phones and money would let me at least try to find a place to live.\u201d Those in the shelters try to maintain the orderly routines of normal Japanese life, seen in the tidy rows of shoes and muddy boots at the doorway to the shelters, where everyone is in socks. But there are also stressful differences: the lack of privacy, the growing odors of hundreds of unwashed bodies and the cries of fear every night during the countless aftershocks. They also feel cut off from their families and the outside world, with no phones or newspapers or Internet access. Meanwhile, the closure of highways and lack of goods have slowed government efforts to deliver more supplies. \u201cWe have no idea what will happen to us next,\u201d said Ms. Kikuchi, 71, whose home and cigarette stand were destroyed by the waves. \u201cI cannot call relatives or friends to ask for help.\u201d Even those whose homes were spared have found themselves living in a state of privation that this modern and wealthy nation has not known since World War II. Entire areas of northern Japan remain without electricity, water or cellphone service. Chronic shortages of everything from rice to gasoline have led to empty or closed stores, and lines at filling stations that extend a mile or more. Maki Niinuma, a 30-year-old homemaker, said her biggest anxiety was providing for her children, particularly her seven-month-old son. While the waves spared her home, fuel shortages have made it hard for her to shop because she wants to keep enough gas in her car to drive the baby to an inland hospital if he gets sick.",

        "article": "In addition to its own editorials, USA TODAY publishes a variety of opinions from outside writers. On political and policy matters, we publish opinions from across the political spectrum. Roughly half of our columns come from our Board of Contributors, a group whose interests range from education to religion to sports to the economy. Their charge is to chronicle American culture by telling the stories, large and small, that collectively make us what we are. We also publish weekly columns by Al Neuharth, USA TODAY's founder, and DeWayne Wickham, who writes primarily on matters of race but on other subjects as well. That leaves plenty of room for other views from across the nation by well-known and lesser-known names alike. There has been no shortage of debate within military circles about revamping the rules of engagement and redefining what should be allowed by U.S. forces in the field. But the military has been mum about a YouTube made by U.S. troops in Afghanistan lip-syncing the lyrics of Lady Gaga's that quickly went viral. \"This is what people do with (their) free time in Afghanistan,\" one of the troops wrote on his Facebook page. The Lady Gaga video spawned copycats across the world. When Israeli soldiers posted a video of them dancing to Ke$ha's TiK ToK, it landed them in hot water after Palestinians complained they were on occupied land. A few Palestinians responded not by throwing rocks but by posting their own dance video, also set to Lady Gaga, which involved simulated pat-downs and intrusive searching. What we sometimes forget as casual observers of the war is just how much down time there is between actual fighting. Even in the blood-soaked peaks of Afghanistan's Korengal Valley, as documented in the movie Restrepo, U.S. soldiers face a significant amount of idle time, which they pass by killing the occasional cow, playing chess, or gyrating to Samantha Fox's Touch Me. With the war entering its 10th year, combat stress and fatigue have naturally compounded. June was the worst month on record for Army suicides, with one per day. Morale, too, has taken a hit as troops are increasingly told to hold their fire to protect civilians. But what is needed is not looser rules of engagement but rather better ways for soldiers to blow off steam. The dance videos are not actively encouraged by the Pentagon brass, but perhaps they should be. Maybe even deploy karaoke machines and dance-instructional videos? Soldiers need to find \"creative ways\" to fill downtime, said Rob Diamond, a Navy vet who served in Operation Iraqi Freedom. \"Blowing off steam is critically important.\" Not just boredom but also the daily trauma of wartime, which, as President Obama pointed out recently, \"you don't have to engage in a firefight to endure.\" The Department of Veterans Affairs recently decided to relax the requirements for war vets with post-traumatic stress disorder to get compensation and medical care \u2014 a rule change long overdue. (To ease back into civilian life, vets are even playing paintball.) The Defense Department also ruled against its own commissioned health study that urged a ban on cigarettes in combat zones. Both are sound moves. Stress relievers are critical to keeping morale up and casualties down. It's not a stretch to assume that scandals involving civilian casualties become more likely because soldiers are wound up too tightly. (That comes across in the Rolling Stonearticle on now-retired general Stanley McChrystal, which documents troops' skepticism of the hold-your-fire commands.) U.S. troops want the rules of engagement loosened, something Gen. David Petraeus hinted he might change. But more important is finding healthy and constructive ways to soothe troops' nerves. There's no booze and few creature comforts. Girly mags are discouraged (well, at least none is sold on bases). Even Lucky Strikes are considered too risky by some military higher-ups. This is not a plea to build more Burger Kings in our bases. Nor is it to reduce war to an episode of Glee. But it is far better to let troops blow off steam by, say, posting a silly dance video on YouTube than by slaughtering a cow or endangering civilians. The Israeli troops were scolded for their routine; the American ones should be commended. (\"I'm going to be Famous!!!\" one of the soldiers posted on Facebook.) This kind of video shows the human side of our soldiers. Heck, it even might win a few hearts and minds along the way.

Then there are those lesser-known preternatural wealth-builders who manage to cobble million-dollar enterprises before they graduate from college by age 22--and some who did it much earlier than that. Cracking the million-dollar mark is no mean feat for any entrepreneur, let alone one who may not be old enough to legally saddle up to a bar in the U.S. Forbes interviewed 15 of these super-strivers. (For a gallery of their photos and short profiles, click here.) Here the million-dollar measure refers to either the annual revenue generated by their businesses (as opposed to total profit) or the value of the enterprises built as implied by the companies' financing arrangements. Example: If an investor paid $100,000 for a 10% equity stake in a young company, the enterprise is said to be worth $1 million (assuming it carries no debt). In Pictures: 15 Wunderkinds Who Made $1 Million Before Graduation--And The Ideas That Got Them There How did these whippersnappers pull it off? Some of them identified problems and created companies to solve them, while others turned their hobbies into money-making ventures. Some teamed up with friends, parents and mentors; others plowed ahead on their own. Here's a look at a few: Autocricket In the summer of 2008, after his high school graduation, Jason Brian started working in the marketing department of a South Florida car dealership. He knew the future of marketing was on the Web. \"With half of the money, I found that I could double the results,\" buying online ads and using search engine optimization techniques, he recalls. Three years later, at age 21, Brian spent \"less than $10,000\" of his savings to build a website that would help consumers look for cars. Autocricket.com made money by selling customers' information to dealers and manufacturers, which could market to customers directly. Six months after launch the site attracted the attention of two entrepreneurs in Naples, Fla., who invested $250,000. The site generated $1.2 million in revenue in 2009, when Brian was 22. In 2010 it did $6 million. Showclix In 2005, when he was 18, Joshua Dziabiak sold his first company--a Web hosting firm called Mediacatch--for north of $1 million. He bought a Mercedes (in cash) and a flat-screen TV, and used the rest to invest in other companies, including Showclix, his current venture, a website that lets performing arts centers, colleges, live music venues and other outlets sell tickets online, over the phone and at their box offices. In 2009 he raised nearly $1 million, which valued the company at $2.75 million. Showclix collects services fees (usually paid by the ticket buyer) of 7% to 15% of ticket sales. Those fees brought in $9 million last year.",

        "article": "It\u2019s not just an estimated 800,000 federal employees who would feel the financial pinch of a government shutdown. Among the people anxiously waiting to hear if Congress can reach a budget deal are front desk clerks at the Ahwahnee Hotel in Yosemite National Park, manufacturing executives whose companies supply goods to federal agencies, bank loan officers who make mortgages guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration and Wall Street analysts who depend on a steady flow of government data. The federal government is, after all, a very big business, and temporarily pulling the plug would disrupt many other businesses. President Obama has warned that the looming shutdown could stall the already fragile economic recovery by choking off much-needed paychecks to workers and introducing another level of uncertainty in an already uncertain world. Economists are divided as to how much the shutdown would rattle the economy. Of course, some of it depends on how long any stoppage lasts. If Congress agrees to a budget quickly, it might be just a few national park visitors who are disappointed over the weekend. But if the hiatus stretches to a week \u2014 or to nearly three weeks as it did in 1995 \u2014 then the ripples could quickly fan out. When the government shut down for 20 days in late 1995, the nation\u2019s economic growth was slowed by as much as a full percentage point in that quarter, according to James F. O\u2019Sullivan, chief economist at MF Global. The effect was temporary, he said, with the economy adding about that much in the following quarter. Mr. O\u2019Sullivan said that over the three months that included the shutdown, federal spending fell 14.2 percent from the previous quarter, before rebounding 8.6 percent in the following quarter. David Greenlaw, United States economist at Morgan Stanley, said other factors might have held back growth in late 1995, including a 10-week strike at Boeing. This time around, the economic expansion faces a number of challenges, including turmoil in the Middle East, concerns about supplies coming from Japan after its earthquake, tsunami and nuclear crisis, and millions of unemployed Americans looking for work. The federal government is such a large customer that many companies, like Booz Allen or Verizon, could be forced to cut back on workers\u2019 hours, though these two companies and many others declined to comment on their plans on Thursday. At the national parks, many of the hotels and restaurants are operated by private concerns that will most likely suspend some workers if the parks are closed. Without their weekly paychecks, those employees could tighten their belts, causing further fallout for grocery stores or other retailers who may see sales slow. In Yosemite, for example, Delaware North Companies Parks and Resorts operates four hotels with 972 rooms and 13 restaurants. A company spokeswoman, Lisa Cesaro, said that if the shutdown continued beyond the weekend, all lodging and food operations would close, and workers would be forced to take vacation time or unpaid leave, right as peak season was starting. Government contractors are worried not only about payments, but also about what to do with inventories they would normally ship to agencies that may be closed. Imagine a parts supplier for the federal government with a scheduled delivery coming up, said Rae Ann S. Johnson, a lawyer and council director for the Manufacturers Alliance/Mapi, a trade group. \u201cIf the government is shut down, there is no one to deliver it to. If they have to store it longer than anticipated, then there are extra costs.\u201d The shutdown could also make it harder for lower-income families to get mortgage loans because the Federal Housing Administration would suspend its guarantee program. The F.H.A. guaranteed about 21 percent of new mortgage loans in 2010, federal data shows. Shaun Donovan, the housing secretary, said on Thursday that he feared some lenders would stop making new F.H.A. loans, or prevent closings by reneging on loan approvals. \u201cThis is the worst time that we could introduce that uncertainty into this fragile housing market,\u201d Mr. Donovan told a Senate subcommittee. Lenders do not need to obtain guarantees at the time a loan is made. Wells Fargo and Bank of America, by far the biggest F.H.A. lenders, said that they would continue to make the loans and simply wait to obtain guarantees \u2014 at least as long as the shutdown remained fairly brief. But JPMorgan Chase said that it would not make new F.H.A. loans during a shutdown, although it emphasized that loans already approved would not be affected. Economists as well as Wall Street analysts and investors fret that the spigot of data churned out by the government could stop if the shutdown extends into next week. Reports scheduled for next week include retail sales and inflation data. A spokesman for the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which calculates the unemployment rate, said that during a shutdown, the agency would not collect data, issue reports or respond to public inquiries, adding that the Web site might not be operational and would not be updated.",

        "article": "Philip Scott Andrews/The New York Times The House speaker, John A. Boehner, announced the federal budget agreement reached Friday night by Congressional leaders. WASHINGTON \u2014 Congressional leaders and President Obama headed off a shutdown of the government with less than two hours to spare Friday night under a tentative budget deal that would cut $38 billion from federal spending this year. After days of tense negotiations and partisan quarrelling, House Republicans came to preliminary terms with the White House and Senate Democrats over financing the government for the next six months, resolving a stubborn impasse that had threatened to disrupt federal operations across the country and around the globe. Speaker John A. Boehner, who had pressed Democrats for cuts sought by members of the conservative new House majority, presented the package of widespread spending reductions and policy provisions and won a positive response from his rank and file shortly before 11 p.m. Both Democrats and Republicans proclaimed they had reached a deal and would begin the necessary steps to pass the bill and send it to Mr. Obama next week. Democrats said that under the agreement, the budget measure would not include provisions sought by Republicans to limit environmental regulations and to restrict financing for Planned Parenthood and other groups that provide abortions. But Mr. Boehner said in a statement that the agreement included a restriction on abortion financing in Washington. \u201cThis has been a lot of discussion and a long fight,\u201d Mr. Boehner said as he left the party meeting. \u201cBut we fought to keep government spending down because it really will in fact help create a better environment for job creators in our country.\u201d Speaking from the White House after the Republican meeting ended, Mr. Obama said that both sides gave ground in reaching the bargain and that some of the cuts accepted by Democrats \u201cwill be painful.\u201d \u201cPrograms people rely on will be cut back,\u201d said Mr. Obama, who said Americans had to begin to live within their means. \u201cNeeded infrastructure projects will be delayed.\u201d The announcements capped a day of drama as lawmakers and members of the federal work force waited anxiously to see whether money for government agencies would run out at midnight. \u201cWe didn\u2019t do it at this late hour for drama,\u201d Senator Harry Reid, the Democratic majority leader, said. \u201cWe did it because it has been hard to arrive at this point.\u201d In the closed-door Republican session, according to people present in the room, Mr. Boehner described the plan as the best deal he could wring from Democrats and said the cuts \u2014 an estimated $38 billion in reductions \u2014 represented the \u201clargest real dollar spending cut in American history.\u201d Although both sides compromised, Republicans were able to force significant spending concessions from Democrats in exchange for putting to rest some of the vexing social policy fights that had held up the agreement. Because of the need to put the compromise into legislative form, Congressional leaders said the House and Senate would vote overnight to pass a stopgap measure financing the government through Thursday to prevent any break in the flow of federal dollars. The actual budget compromise would be considered sometime next week. The Senate approved the stopgap measure by 11:20 p.m. and the House approved it after midnight. The Office of Management and Budget issued a memo saying normal government operations were back on track. The developments came after Republicans and Democrats spent the day blaming each other for what could have been the first lapse in government services brought on by Congress in 15 years. As the midnight deadline approached, efforts to finish a deal intensified, and Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner spoke by telephone to try to find an agreement. \u201cBoth sides are working hard to reach the kind of resolution Americans desire,\u201d said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate Republican leader, who had consulted closely with Mr. Boehner on strategy during the fractious talks. \u201cA resolution is actually within reach. The contours of a final agreement are coming into focus.\u201d Mr. McConnell\u2019s optimism could not disguise the fact that time was steadily slipping away, and testy leaders of the two parties were pushing hard to shape public perceptions of who was responsible for an impasse that threatened to have serious political repercussions \u2014 and to presage even more consequential fiscal showdowns in the months ahead. Democrats said Republicans were insisting on overreaching policy provisions; Republicans said it remained about money. Michael D. Shear contributed reporting.",

        "article": "This year, for the first time, high schools students must score at least 65 on the English exam, as well as on four other state tests \u2014 math, science, global history and United States history \u2014 to earn a diploma. The three-hour English test includes 25 multiple choice questions; one essay; and two short responses that are each supposed to be a paragraph long. A short response is scored 0 to 2 points. A student who gets 1\u2019s on both responses has a pretty good shot at scoring 65 and passing the exam. Here, from the state teachers\u2019 scoring guide, is an excerpt from a short response written by an unnamed student. The guide says it deserves a score of 1: These two Charater have very different mind Sets because they are creative in away that no one would imagen just put clay together and using leaves to create Art. Theoretically, passing the English Regents would mean that a student could read and write. Here is the topic sentence of another student\u2019s short response that, according to the state guide, also deserves a 1: In the poem, the poets use of language was very depth into it. Until recently there were two main graduation options in New York. Students could earn a Regents-endorsed diploma by passing several state exams, or they could earn a local diploma. But the two-tier system has been phased out. No longer will there be a local diploma option. New York\u2019s last three education commissioners, all leaders in the reform movement, have been suspicious of assessment instruments that rely too heavily on people who work in schools. State officials have instead chosen to use one English test to assess every high school student in the state, which has caused another fairly gigantic problem: How do you create a single graduation exam for 200,000 seniors when some are heading to the Ivy League and others to pump gas? If the standard is set too high, so many will fail \u2014 including children with special education needs and students for whom English is a second language \u2014 that there will be a public outcry. But if the standard is set too low, the result is a diploma that has little meaning. So far, officials have opted to dumb down the state tests. The New York State education commissioner, John B. King Jr., and the chancellor, Merryl H. Tisch, say they want to change that. They are considering raising the passing English score to 75. They are also counting on a new set of national learning standards, known as the common core, which are currently being developed in more than 40 states. The hope is that more sophisticated standards detailing what children should know, coupled with more sophisticated curriculums and exams, will result in a more rigorous public education system. \u201cThe D.O.E./Board of Regents position on the passing score for this exam, with attention to college and career readiness, will be re-examined in conjunction with administering a revised exam in this subject area aligned to the Common Core State Standards,\u201d a spokesman for Dr. King wrote. The current state English exam appears to be the easiest in memory. From 1999 to 2011, the test was given in two three-hour sessions that required students to write four essays. But a series of school closings caused by snowstorms forced state officials to reschedule the two-day exams, which was a logistical nightmare. So in 2009, the Board of Regents voted to reduce the exam to a single session. (In the decades before 1999, the English exam was also one three-hour session, but required students to answer 60 to 65 multiple choice questions and write two essays.) The English exam is graded on a sliding scale, meaning there are several possible ways to score a 65. A student can: \u00b6 Score 1 on each of the short responses; 4 on the essay (which is graded on a 1-6 scale); and answer 17 of the 25 multiple choice questions correctly. \u00b6 Score 1 and 2 on the short responses; 3 on the essay; and answer 17 of 25 correctly. \u00b6 Score 1\u2019s on the short responses; 3 on the essay; and answer 20 of 25 correctly. Below are two \u201csentences\u201d from an essay that according to the scoring guidelines, deserves a 3: Even though their is no physical conflict withen each other. Their are jealousy problems between each other that each one wish could have. The January essay was supposed to focus on a quotation from Goethe, \u201cNo two persons regard the world in exactly the same way.\u201d These are the first few sentences from an essay that should be given a score of 4: In life, \u201cno two people regard the world in exactly the same way,\u201d as J. W. von Goethe says. Everyone sees and reacts to things in different ways. Even though they may see the world in similar ways, no two people\u2019s views will ever be exactly the same. This statement is true since everyone sees things through different viewpoints. Despite a decade of state English testing under No Child Left Behind, the results are disheartening, even in New York City, where a data-driven system was put in place by a former chancellor, Joel I. Klein, and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, two giants of the reform movement. Sad to say, during the Bloomberg administration, little if any progress has been made, if test results are to be believed. In 2003, 52.5 percent of fourth graders were proficient in English, compared with 51 percent in 2011. In 2003, 32 .6 percent of eighth graders were proficient, compared with 35 percent today. Perhaps, as leaders of the reform movement seem to believe, there are new and higher standards, stronger curriculums and better tests just over the next hill to solve all our problems. But four now, Wm. Shakespare must Be a turnover in his Grave (1 point).",

For her effort, she might get the chance to play her older sister Venus in the semifinals. Venus will play her quarterfinal match tonight against No. 3 Jelena Jankovic. \u201cIf I have to play Venus, it will be a good challenge for me to play both sisters in the same tournament,\u201d Henin said. No player has beaten the Williams sisters back to back since Martina Hingis did it in 2001 at the Australian Open. \u201cEvery match is a final for me now,\u201d Henin said. \u201cThere is a lot of expectations, for sure.\u201d Henin, ranked No. 1 for 80 weeks during her career, has won at least one title in a Grand Slam event every year since 2003, which she concluded by winning her first United States Open title. The Australian Open was the one Grand Slam event that Serena Williams won this year. It was also the one major that Henin missed this year, while she was seperating from her husband of four years, Pierre-Yves Hardenne. Serena Williams, who was unseeded, won the tournament during a mesmerizing run against the best the women\u2019s Tour seemed to offer. In March, Williams continued her dominance by beating Henin in three sets in the final at Key Biscayne, Fla. Henin\u2019s year truly began to turn around in April, when her older brother, David, was involved in a car accident that left him in a coma. Henin had been estranged from David, her other brother, Thomas, and her father, Jos\u00e9, while she was married. But she came to the hospital room when David woke up and began an emotional family reconciliation. Henin went on the win the French Open in June. Last night, she received text messages from her family back in Belgium immediately after the match. \u201cIt\u2019s just an amazing feeling,\u201d Henin said of her family\u2019s reconciliation. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of love. That gives a lot of confidence for the rest of my life, not only for my career.\u201d If Henin is playing unfettered, painting the lines, serving down the middle and befuddling her opponents, Williams has been out of sorts since spraining her left thumb at Wimbledon in the round before losing to Henin. This was her first match since Wimbledon, and she dismissed the notion that her fitness was a problem, even though she appeared to be laboring in the second set. Asked to explain what went wrong, she said: \u201cNo, I can\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry. Any more questions?\u201d From the opening game, Henin never stopped attacking. She broke Williams\u2019s serve to begin the match. In the sixth game of the first set, when Williams had two break point chances, Henin swung at a volley that sailed long, then let loose a scream that rattled the stadium. Henin had a set point and was serving for the match at 5-4 when Williams\u2019s backhand winner evened the set. Williams yelled, \u201cCome on!\u201d But something was missing. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t herself out there,\u201d said her mother and coach, Oracene Price. \u201cIt was a scream, but it wasn\u2019t the right scream. It\u2019s not the one, \u2018Oooh, I got it now, I\u2019m coming at you.\u2019 \u201d Williams was able to hold off another set point when Henin was serving at 6-5, sending the first set into a tie breaker. But after that, Williams was powerless against Henin, who struck 30 winners to Williams\u2019s 17. More than those statistics, Henin has earned the respect of a pair of tennis Hall of Famers. \u201cJustine is one the few players I\u2019d pay to watch,\u201d said Martina Navratilova. Comparing Henin to Roger Federer, the top-ranked men\u2019s player, Navratilova added: \u201cTo me, she and Roger are the same type of player, she\u2019s just the women\u2019s version.\u201d At 5-foot-5 \u00be, Henin does not tower over her larger opponents, but finds the torque within her frame. \u201cPound for pound, she\u2019s like Rosie Casals when we played or Tracy Austin,\u201d Billie Jean King said as she walked into the stadium for last night\u2019s match. Even as tennis technology has changed and players have grown larger, Henin has continued to adapt and dominate. \u201cI start to trust myself much more than in the past because it hasn\u2019t been luck for me,\u201d Henin said. \u201cI don\u2019t have anything to prove except enjoy my tennis on the court and try to stay healthy and enjoy every moment of it.\u201d For one night, at least, she could.

        "article": "(CNN) -- The body of an Illinois lottery winner was exhumed Friday by the Cook County medical examiner's office after toxicology results showed he died of cyanide poisoning. An autopsy was performed on Urooj Khan's body, Dr. Stephen Cina, county medical examiner, told reporters. It will take a few weeks for testing results and he could not predict the results, he said. Cyanide can evaporate after death, and it's possible it may not be present, he said. Murder by cyanide poisoning is extremely rare, experts say. Khan died in July, the day after the lottery issued him a check for about $425,000 after taxes. He won the money playing a scratch-off game a month earlier. \"We are investigating it as a murder, and we're working closely with the medical examiner's office,\" Chicago police spokeswoman Melissa Stratton said last week. Cina said Friday, \"We've already determined it was a homicide, and nothing we've seen today would change that.\" On the day he died, Khan's wife said she made dinner at home and then he went to bed. A little less than an hour later, his screams of agony woke her up. His family rushed him to a hospital, but it was too late. Initially, doctors ruled the 46-year-old died of natural causes. But later that week, an unnamed relative called the medical examiner's office. \"This person must have made a compelling case,\" Cina told CNN's Martin Savidge this month. \"This was serious enough to order a full battery of toxicology, including unusual agents such as cyanide and strychnine.\" The lab technician retested Khan's blood, and results came back in November. \"It was definitely in the lethal range for cyanide in the blood,\" Cina said. Cook County policy is not to perform autopsies on anyone under 50 unless the death is suspicious or an autopsy is requested. Cyanide is among the most potent and deadly poisons, but it is not easy to get. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission prohibits the retail sale of products with cyanide salts. It is, however, available from industrial sources. It cleans metal and is used in research labs and mining. Cyanide can be found in some household products, such as acetonitrile false fingernail remover. There are also tiny quantities of it in cigarette smoke, and even smaller amounts in almonds, the pits of stone fruits such as apricots, and lima beans. Someone would have to eat a large quantity of those foods for them to become toxic. \"Like everything else, dose makes the poison,\" said Dr. Robert Geller, medical director of the Georgia Poison Center and an associate professor at Emory University School of Medicine. He co-wrote a study about cyanide poisoning and pediatric patients. For someone to die from cyanide poisoning, he or she would have to inhale or consume a large quantity, which can cause a quick death, according to Geller. If someone received a less severe exposure, such as through eating, the person would show early symptoms of weakness, confusion, headache, dizziness and shortness of breath. If untreated, the person could experience nausea, hypertension, vomiting, coma, seizure and then death due to cardio-respiratory arrest. A person who has been poisoned with cyanide may take on a cherry-red coloring, and the retinal veins and arteries would appear red because the person's cells cannot get oxygen from the blood. In a small number of cases, a patient's breath may smell like bitter almonds due to the excretion of unmetabolized cyanide, but more often than not it's undetectable, according to Geller. \"In terms of intentional poisonings, you don't have a lot of that with cyanide,\" Geller said. The Georgia Poison Center has handled more than 800,000 cases of poisoning, he said, and cyanide rarely turned up in those cases. There is an antidote kit (PDF) available for cyanide, but doctors treating Khan would have had to suspect cyanide early in his treatment to use it. \"Because it is so rare and is used so infrequently, the medical profession may have a difficult time recognizing cyanide poisoning,\" Geller said. The same is true after death. Scientists don't usually test for cyanide in the battery of toxicology tests they may run in a suspicious death and don't generally look for it unless there is a reason to suspect it. Plus, there's an economic factor. \"The harder you want to find something, the more expensive it is, and this country's forensic labs run on a shoestring budget,\" Geller said. Even knowing that Khan was poisoned, it may be difficult to determine how the cyanide got there. \"Cyanide does break down in the body fairly quickly, so they may not find much,\" Geller said. \"Now that he's been buried and embalmed, you don't have the ideal situation,\" said Dr. Daniel J. Spitz, a forensic pathologist and toxicologist and the chief medical examiner for Michigan's Macomb and St. Clair counties. Spitz co-wrote the book \"Medicolegal Investigations of Death,\" considered the bible of forensic pathology that pathologists worldwide use. \"If this were me, I'd be hoping with an autopsy every other cause of death is rejected,\" Spitz said. \"You don't want to have a competing cause of death when you present your case in court.\" In this next step in the investigation, scientists will examine Khan's brain, the liver and even solid organs to try to detect the presence of cyanide so they have more than one test showing it's what killed him -- and a better sense of how it was introduced into his body. \"Many people think, with this kind of poisoning being rare and something that may not be seen, that this would be a murder someone could get away with,\" Geller said. \"But clearly it is not, since they did figure out this was cyanide, and there is a very good likelihood someone will get caught.\"",

DETAILS: Built in 1939, this Federal-style home in University Park has beamed ceilings, a stone fireplace in the family room and a paneled library. In the sun room are antique brick and oak floors. The kitchen cabinets are painted burnt orange in honor of the Texas Longhorns, the football team from the University of Texas at Austin (the husband was team captain in 1958). A pool house with a full bathroom and kitchenette sits in the English garden. An apartment over the garage has another two bedrooms and a full bath. The mature garden includes three bald cypress trees planted when the house was built, according to the owners. The family room with wet bar SELLERS: Beverly and Arlis Parkhurst. Mrs. Parkhurst is a retired interior designer. Mr. Parkhurst is a retired private investor. THE NEIGHBORHOOD: You can walk the six blocks to the designer boutiques at the Highland Park Village. After hitting the stores try the fennel-crusted tuna salad and the homemade ice cream sandwiches at Bistro 31. It's about 12 minutes to the Dallas Museum of Art, where \"The Fashion World of Jean Paul Gaultier: From the Sidewalk to the Catwalk\" just opened. WHAT WE PAID: The Parkhursts paid $1.7 million for the house in 2008 and estimate that they put have put $500,000 into remodeling it, including redoing the kitchen, the electrical and the air-conditioning. WHY WE'RE SELLING: \"It's more space than we needed,\" says Mrs. Parkhurst. \"We never used the upstairs.\" The Parkhursts have downsized to a 3,500-square-foot house two blocks away. WHAT WE'LL MISS: The fireplace in the family room and the garden, including the blue, white and pink hydrangeas as well as the eight-foot-tall gardenia bush. WHAT WE WON'T: \"Having so much space to keep up and so many rooms to keep up when you never use them,\" says Mrs. Parkhurst. OTHERS SAY:Clarke Landry of Dave Perry-Miller & Associates has shown the house to clients and says the price is in the right range, considering the location in a good school district, the picturesque street and the home's original details. \"It's timeless,\" she says. Betty Godwin of Dave Perry-Miller has the listing and says that the size of the lot and the finishes justify the price. \"It's on such a large lot that it's hard to comp,\" says Ms. Godwin, noting that there is a hundred feet of street frontage.

        "article": "The subway conductor allegedly attacked by an off-duty police officer feared for her life during the assault, she told the Daily News Friday. The 28-year-old victim was walking away from off-duty Officer Mirjan Lolja \u2014 who was irate about having to wait 20 minutes for a train \u2014 when he charged the transit worker on a Bronx platform two days before Christmas, she said. Another MTA employee on the platform tried to warn the conductor, but there wasn\u2019t enough time to react, she said. \u201cBefore I turned around, this guy was on my back and I\u2019m on the floor,\u201d said the conductor, whose name The News is withholding. \u201cI was on my knees on the floor. It just happened so fast. I\u2019m trying to get this guy off me and he\u2019s not letting up. He\u2019s choking me and pulling my hair.\u201d The Dec. 23 assault at the Tremont Ave. station on the D line continued even after the conductor\u2019s coworker tried to stop Lolja (photo), the conductor said. \u201cI felt like it lasted forever,\u201d she said. \u201cI was really scared for my life.\u201d Lolja allegedly ran from the subway station. He wasn\u2019t identified until police released a video showing him going through the turnstiles with a smirk on his face. He came forward Thursday and was suspended. But Lolja hasn\u2019t been charged, angering John Samuelsen, president of Transport Workers Union Local 100, and Joe Costales, a division chairman representing conductors. \u201cThe police officer who perpetrated this crime should have already been arrested,\u201d Samuelsen said in a statement Friday. Said Costales: \u201cHe should be hit with the fullest penalty under the law.\u201d Lolja\u2019s lawyer, Stephen Worth, declined comment Friday. Police have said the Internal Affairs Bureau is investigating the incident. The officer claims the conductor was the aggressor and grabbed his phone when he tried to take her photograph, sources said. The conductor still can\u2019t believe the alleged attacker was a cop. \u201cI thought people were lying,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought there\u2019s no way it could be a police officer acting like that. I still can\u2019t process it.\u201d Lolja has been on the force seven years. The conductor is a rookie with about 10 months on the job. She asked for the night shift so she could spend days with her two-year-old twin boys, she said. The woman still hasn\u2019t returned to work. She\u2019s has pain in her knees, back and scalp from the assault. \u201cI\u2019m so overwhelmed,\u201d she said. \u201cHonestly, I just finished crying. I just want to go back to life as normal. Why did he mess with us like that? Why didn\u2019t he leave us alone? Why?\u201d",

        "article": "An image taken from a YouTube video allegedly shows Islamic State (Isis) militants taking part in a military parade in Mosul, northern Iraq. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images Britain should encourage jihadis fighting in Syria and Iraq to \"come home\", the former global counter-terrorism director of MI6 has said. David Cameron outlined new powers last week for police to seize the passports of terrorist suspects and stop British extremists from returning to the UK. Others, including Boris Johnson, the London mayor, have called for British jihadis to have their citizenship removed. However, Richard Barrett, a former counter-terrorism chief at MI5 and MI6, said repentant fighters needed \"to know that there is a place for them back at home\". His comments follow reports that dozens of disillusioned British jihadis are looking at ways to return to the UK, but fear being imprisoned. Barrett, who also led the UN mission to track down Osama bin Laden, said returning fighters could prove an invaluable asset in dissuading potential jihadis from travelling to fight with Islamic State (Isis). \"Many of the people who have been most successful in undermining the terrorist narrative are themselves ex-extremists,\" said Barrett, adding that such people can \"explain why going abroad to fight is a very bad idea\". He said: \"It would seem sensible to encourage British and other foreign fighters who have joined the Islamic State or other extremist groups in Syria and Iraq, and now realise this was wrong, to come home. \"These are the people who can expose the true nature of the Islamic State and its leadership. Their stories of brutality and the motives behind it will be far more credible and persuasive than the rhetoric of men in suits. \"These repentant fighters need a way out, and although the law must take its course, they need to know there is a place for them back at home if they are committed to a non-violent future.\" Researchers at the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at King's College London have recently been contacted by jihadis who say that they are despondent about the situation in Syria and that, although they fear lengthy custodial sentences, they would be happy to enrol on de-radicalisation programmes. \"These ex-fighters could help the authorities to understand better than they do now why people are still going to Syria and Iraq and what needs to be done to slow the flow to a trickle or stop it altogether,\" said Barrett. Pressure for a fundamental reappraisal of Britain's de-radicalisation programme is mounting among experts and politicians. Hazel Blears, a former Home Office minister, echoed the need to use the experiences of extremists to prevent other Britons following in their footsteps. \"Provided you start from a sceptical point of view and you can find some who are genuinely remorseful, for whom it's been a terrible experience, and who are prepared to join a programme talking to other young people, then absolutely you should be trying to work with them. It's a very powerful narrative.\" Senior Liberal Democrat figures are also understood to be open to the notion of offering jihadis a way back home, so long as they renounce violence. Sir Menzies Campbell, a former party leader, said: \"I don't think we could give them a total amnesty, but we could treat them leniently in return for completing a de-radicalisation programme.\" The threat posed by Isis will be the subject of a day-long Commons debate on Wednesday. Conservative whips have begun to take soundings at Westminster over Tory MPs' attitude to military action, indicating that the backbench mood was \"hardening\". However, Blears added: \"There's no point taking military action if you continue to have a supply chain of people ready to go here in Britain and across the world.\" More than 500 British citizens are believed to have travelled to the region since 2011. In today's Observer, the controversial British Islamist Anjem Choudary acknowledges Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the self-declared Islamic State, as \"the caliph of all Muslims and the prince of the believers\". His support of Baghdadi comes days after a video was released showing the beheading of the American journalist Steven Sotloff, apparently by the same British jihadi member of Isis who had taken part in the decapitation of Sotloff's fellow hostage James Foley. It also follows a succession of atrocities perpetrated and disseminated by Isis fighters, including massacres of captured Syrian soldiers and reported genocidal attacks on the Yazidi minority. Human Rights Watch says it has identified sites of Isis mass killings in the Iraqi city of Tikrit. Choudary, who has had links with a number of Muslims convicted under UK anti-terror laws, dismissed the allegations against Isis as propaganda, expressing his admiration for the jihadi state and claiming that Christians were voluntarily returning to Isis-ruled Mosul because they wanted to live under sharia law. Meanwhile, a French journalist held hostage for months by Isis in Syria has revealed that one of his abductors was Mehdi Nemmouche, the Frenchman suspected of killing four people, two of them Israeli citizens, at the Brussels Jewish Museum this year. French magazine Le Point quoted its reporter, Nicolas Henin, saying that he had been tortured by Nemmouche, who is now in custody. Henin was held for a time with Foley and Sotloff and was released in April.",

The Braves, who must feel like they've already been run over by Philadelphia's pitching staff, now must look both ways -- more at a tightening wild-card race than at a disappearing division battle. And Tampa Bay reminds us again that these Rays just don't go away. The Twins are the first team into this year's post-season, the Phillies and Yankees continue increasing their leads in head-to-head showdowns, and it pitching -- what else -- that carries the Giants and Padres in baseball's best race. The concussion Cardinals catcher Jason LaRue suffered in an August 10 on-field brawl at Cincinnati has ended his career.

The Reds will go with Johnny Cueto, a 12-game winner who pitched well in his two starts against the Phils this year but did not get a win in his last six starts... CINCINNATI (AP) -- Charlie Manuel and the Philadelphia Phillies need just one more win to return to the NL championship series. Cole Hamels is ready to go in Game 3, and if he can't get it done, Roy Halladay and Roy Oswalt are right behind him. So while ...thing is to win one.

Pitchers will be front and center Saturday night with Cy Young Award winners present and possibly future on the mound. They're two completely unrelated events -- one a series of flailing kicks, the other a graceful jump and throw (but an awkward landing) -- yet they'll both cost fantasy owners the services of two pretty talented players. Cincinnati pitcher Johnny Cueto has been suspended seven games for what Major League Baseball calls \"violent and aggressive actions\" during Tuesday's brawl between the Reds and St. Louis Cardinals. The Texas Rangers made a statement that's more important in their clubhouse than anywhere else. The Minnesota Twins love what Chicago White Sox manager Ozzie Guillen says about them but made a rather emphatic point that he's wrong. And the Cardinals and Reds? It's escalated way beyond talk. We get the Red Sox-Yankees out of the way after their afternoon game today. That four-game series -- more sexy to the TV networks this year because of the markets and the history rather than the impact in the standings -- was just a warmup to some serious showdowns this week.",

Nail has several gems on his second album, including one he wrote with two members of Lady Antebellum and another he rescued from an old Keith Urban album. He sings about them on Songs for Sale, with its harmonies from Lee Ann Womack, and on the title track, a road-tripping relation to Marc Cohn's Walking in Memphis.

Travie and his band sound as if they're having a blast, too, as they bounce back and forth among metallic guitar riffs, hip-hop verses and sweetly melodic pop-rock choruses.

        "article": "Steve Jobs' 2005 commencement address at Stanford University has been viewed more than 2 million times on YouTube. Five years after he delivered it, a text version still flies around the Web. The speech is as powerful for its message--stay hungry, stay foolish--as it is for its structure and delivery. \"Today I want to tell you three stories from my life,\" says Jobs. \"That's it. No big deal. Just three stories.\" And with that, viewers (and readers) are hooked. Future public speakers of the world, take note. You don't have to be a Silicon Valley billionaire to deliver a great speech. The best speeches include a clear, relevant message and a few great stories to illustrate it. In Pictures: How To Give A Great Speech Forget fancy PowerPoint presentations and loads of data. Instead, keep your speech simple, with a clear beginning, middle and end. Focus on one theme, and eliminate everything else. \"Speeches are an inefficient form of communication,\" says Nick Morgan, the president of Public Words, Inc., and author of Trust Me: Four Steps to Authenticity and Charisma. \"People don't remember much of what they hear, so focus and keep it simple.\" Use anecdotes. \"People struggle so mightily writing speeches when all they have to do is find a message and three great stories to prove it,\" says Jane Praeger, a Columbia University professor and the president of the speech presentation and coaching firm Ovid Inc. \"Those speeches are also easier to deliver because you can recall a story from memory and tell it from your heart. The content has to be inspiring and visual. It should convey emotion and have a particular point of view. If you have the elements of a good speech, your delivery is halfway there.\" Be relevant to your audience. Ask yourself what problem the audience wants to solve, and talk about that problem first. \"Then and only then, talk about your area of expertise as the solution to that problem,\" says Morgan. \"Audiences start off by asking why. Why am I here? Why should I care? If you answer those questions early, then they'll ask how. Your job is to answer the why question first and then address the how.\" Ditch the thank yous, and jump right in. People often make the mistake of starting speeches by thanking the introducer or expressing their happiness at being there. \"Instead, jump right in with a framing story that suggests what the topic is without giving it all away, a statistic, a question or some kind of interaction with the audience,\" says Morgan. If you know what your speech is about--and it should be about one thing--you should have an easy time deciding on an opening. Get right into the story and let the audience know what your talk will be about. Use body language that makes you appear comfortable. If you show signs of nervousness, like crossing your arms, or clutching your hands in front of your stomach, your audience will sense your trepidation and be less open to your message. \"You have to pretend that you're having a good time and are open to that audience so that they can have a good time and be open back to you,\" says Morgan. \"Successful public speaking is all about passion and emotion. If you're excited, then your audience will be, too.\" Stand up straight. Whether you walk across the stage or stand behind a lectern, try to maintain good posture. \"Imagine that your head is being held up by a string,\" says Praeger.",

        "article": "Yemen\u2019s parliament agreed Wednesday to impose a 30-day state of emergency, further infuriating anti-government demonstrators, who vowed to go ahead with a planned mass march Friday on President Ali Abdullah Saleh\u2019s palace. \u201cWe will enter his bedroom if we have to and drag him out,\u201d said Mohammed Qahtan, a spokesman for a coalition of opposition political parties. Yemen\u2019s growing protest movement has demanded that Saleh resign immediately. The Obama administration and regional governments have grown increasingly concerned at the rapid disintegration of Saleh\u2019s 32-year-old regime, whose cooperation they depend on to fight Yemen-based al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, known as AQAP. Fearing a breakdown in counterterrorism operations and opportunities for militant gains if Saleh is violently overthrown or resigns precipitously, they have urged him to get in front of the situation and make plans for an orderly transfer of power, according to sources close to the situation. They spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid inflaming Yemeni actors on all sides. Concerned governments have issued only guarded public statements. \u201cI think things are obviously, or evidently, very unsettled in Yemen,\u201d Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates told reporters traveling with him in Cairo. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a good working relationship with President Saleh. He\u2019s been an important ally in the counterterrorism arena,\u201d Gates said. Although the secretary noted that \u201cclearly, there\u2019s a lot of unhappiness inside Yemen,\u201d he said in response to questions that the United States had not done \u201cany post-Saleh planning.\u201d U.S. military personnel on the ground in Yemen and armed drones flying over its territory gather intelligence on AQAP and look for opportunities to target the group\u2019s leaders. At the State Department, spokesman Mark Toner said there were no plans to curtail U.S. economic and military assistance to Yemen. \u201cIt\u2019s about the government-to-government aspects of it and not necessarily tied to one individual,\u201d he said. On Monday, Saleh sent his foreign minister to Saudi Arabia, seeking the kingdom\u2019s intervention in persuading Yemeni tribal leaders to pull back from the opposition. Instead, sources said, the Saudis and others have pressed Saleh to come up with a plan for an earlier, orderly exit that will satisfy protesters. The demonstrators have rejected his offer this week to step down by the end of the year and have demanded finding a replacement with a democratically elected government. One fear shared by Yemen\u2019s counterterrorism partners is that militants who have largely stayed outside the youth-led protests, which began late last month, will try to spark violent upheaval or will take advantage of any violence between the government and demonstrators. That possibility appeared more real this week as a number of senior military commanders defected to the opposition along with their troops, who set up a protective cordon around the demonstrators. Military forces loyal to the government have set up their own protective force around the presidential palace and other government buildings in the capital, Sanaa. Sultan al-Barakani, the head of the ruling General People\u2019s Congress parliamentary bloc, said that although the government appreciates the demands of the revolutionary youths, the threat of armed force by the opposition was illegal and necessitated the state of emergency. Opposition leaders said that the law was enacted without a legitimate parliamentary majority and that the government\u2019s true aim was to illegally suppress protests and allow widespread arrests at public gatherings. The escalation this week of the standoff between Saleh and the opposition was sparked by the shooting deaths Friday of more than 50 protesters. \u201cThe ruling in today\u2019s [parliamentary] session allows the shedding of Yemeni blood, theft of property and honor, and the invasion of public privacy,\u201d senior opposition leader Ahmed Bahri said. He predicted the government would fall \u201cwithin a week.\u201d Saleh met Wednesday with senior tribal leaders to ask for support. He said that the opposition has no national agenda and that his departure could exacerbate long-standing regional tensions and split Yemen into three countries along tribal lines. Special correspondent Hakim Almasmari in Sanaa, Yemen, and correspondent Craig Whitlock in Cairo contributed to this report.",

        "article": "LeBron James and Team USA slam way past Argentina in the Olympic semifinals Friday in London. LONDON - Once Carmelo Anthony drilled the 3-pointer that put Argentina away, the U.S. bench emptied onto the floor for a brief celebration. The real party can't take place until Sunday. After Anthony retreated down the court like a boxer told to find a neutral corner following a knockout, Kevin Durant bear-hugged his Olympic teammate, which may be the only way to contain the incomparable scorers on the U.S. roster. Then again, there may no stopping these Americans. Not now. Not this close. Not one win from gold. \"We won't take this opportunity for granted,\" LeBron James promised. \"We look forward to the challenge on Sunday.\" Spain may not be as eager. With the four-headed offensive juggernaut of Anthony, Durant, James and Kobe Bryant combining for 68 points and taking turns inflicting punishment on Argentina, the U.S. rolled to a 109-83 win on Friday night in the semifinals of the men's tournament, setting up the same gold-medal game as four years ago in Beijing. It's a rematch with Spain. It may be another mismatch. Through seven games, the Americans have been better than advertised. They've turned what was potentially a competitive tournament into a one-team showcase of their superior skills. The U.S. has had too much outside shooting, too much inside muscle, too much of everything for any opponent to handle. And now that it's decided to ratchet up its defense, which had been suspect during stretches of the preliminary round, the Americans are poised to claim a second straight Olympic title. \"From here on out, you'll see a different focus level for us,\" Anthony said. Durant scored 19 points, James and Anthony added 18 apiece and Bryant scored 13 for the Americans, who only led by seven points at halftime. But as has happened in almost every game, the U.S. shifted gears after halftime and ran away. Durant made four 3-pointers in the third quarter, when James delivered one of those devastating dunks that only he can. Starting on the left side, James dribbled across the lane, then down the right side before rising and slamming the ball through the rim, a play that seemed to take the collective breath away from sellout crowd in North Greenwich Arena. It certainly knocked the wind out of Argentina. \"That gave us some momentum, that dunk,\" Anthony said. \"We fed off that energy.\" Then, it was Anthony's turn. With the U.S. already well ahead, Anthony knocked down three consecutive 3s in a span of 42 seconds, a breathtaking barrage like the one he had when he made 10 3-pointers and scored 37 points to help the U.S. put up an Olympic-record 156 points last week in a win over Nigeria. Anthony, though, couldn't do it without someone giving him the ball. This U.S. team has been unselfish, at times to a fault. \"The good thing about these guys is when they see one guy's got it, they go to him,\" coach Mike Krzyzewski said. \"The scoring capability that each of them have, and then to kind of focus on that one guy when they see he has it is really gratifying to me and tells me what type of guys I've had the honor of coaching so far.\" Despite injuries and inconsistency in this tournament, Spain is back in the final for the second straight Olympics. Rallying in the second half, the Spaniards defeated Russia 67-59 in the first semifinal, doing their part to guarantee another crack at the Americans, who beat them 118-109 at the Beijing Games. The world has changed a lot in four years, but not in international basketball. The U.S. and Spain have been on top since '08, and now they'll meet again. \"It's only right,\" said James, who added seven assists and seven rebounds against Argentina. \"Everyone said that this is the game they wanted to see. We're happy as a team we're able to be back in this position.\" The Americans believe this team is better than the '08 squad, and they are certainly more potent \u2014 with a chance to end up outscoring the original Dream Team in 1992. \"You have three scorers on this team who get blistering hot if they make two shots in a row,\" Bryant said. \"I've never seen anything like it.\" Argentina hasn't either. Beaten by 29 points by the U.S. in pool play, the defending bronze medalists stayed close in the first half, making five 3-pointers in the second quarter. But staying close with the Americans is one thing. No team except for Lithuania has been able to catch and pass the U.S. in the second half.",

        "article": "The Joe Gibbs Racing squadron continued its torrid pace Friday afternoon, as Matt Kenseth won the pole for Sunday's Pure Michigan 400 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series race at Michigan International Speedway. JGR drivers swept the top three qualifying spots in their Toyotas, as they put a serious hurting on the field in the Irish Hills of Michigan. Kenseth, the last qualifier to go out, took the No. 1 spot with a wide-open lap of 197.488 miles per hour. That allowed Kenseth to eclipse teammate Denny Hamlin, who moments earlier had run 196.990 mph, good enough to claim the outside pole. Carl Edwards qualified third in another JGR Toyota, followed by Austin Dillon in a Richard Childress Racing Chevrolet and Tony Stewart in a Stewart-Haas Racing Chevy. Kyle Busch was sixth in the fourth and final JGR entry, while Hendrick Motorsports teammates Jimmie Johnson and Dale Earnhardt Jr. qualified eighth and ninth, respectively. The pole was third of the year and 16th in 567 career starts for Kenseth, the 2003 Sprint Cup champion. Asked if the thought the team would sweep the top three spots, Kenseth laughed. \"Maybe the 1-2-3, but I didn't think I'd be one of the three,\" said Kenseth.\" Kenseth said the lap posted by Hamlin was a challenge. \"Denny put up such a fast lap, I got into (Turn) 3 and I was bound and determined I was going to make it wide open,\" said Kenseth. \"And I had the first half of the corner. It was the second half that was starting to get exciting and I got sliding up the track and bogged down a little bit, so I wasn't sure I was going to have it (the pole).\" But Kenseth held on in an impressive display of speed. Hamlin said he wasn't upset at narrowly missing the pole. \"It just comes down to an arms race, making sure you have a fast car and a big engine,\" said Hamlin. \"These guys have done a great job giving us fast cars.\" As for Edwards, who was fastest in the day's lone practice, he was philosophical. \"Being upset about third is nice,\" he said. With a new, high-drag aerodynamic package similar to what was used in last month's Brickyard 400, NASCAR opted for two rounds of single-car qualifying, rather than the typical group qualifying. This time out, qualifying speeds were down dramatically from the record 206.558 mph set by Jeff Gordon last year in this race. JGR drivers swept the top four qualifying positions in the opening round, with Kenseth, the winner two weeks ago at Pocono, atop the speed charts with a lap of 195.988 mph. In the last seven races, JGR drivers have won five times and finished second once. Among the drivers who failed to advance to Round 2 were 2012 Cup champ Brad Keselowski (14th), June Michigan winner Kurt Busch (16th), defending race winner Jeff Gordon (21st) and Danica Patrick (23rd). The only driver who didn't qualify was Reed Sorenson.",

These albums will give you a reason to roll down your windows and play as loud as you can. MUST-PLAY PICK OF THE WEEK: The Belle Brigade's \"Where Not to Look for Freedom\" SKIP: The Steve Miller Band, \"Let Your Hair Down\" Steve Miller continues his blues odyssey (you could argue that his entire career has been a blues odyssey) with his second album of covers. \"Let Your Hair Down\" follows 2010's \"Bingo!\" with more studied takes on the classic Chicago music. Miller is a master, and his love is real. Still, there's only so many tasteful blues remakes I can handle in one year. I'm skipping this one and waiting for Steve Miller to write some originals. WATCH Steve Miller discuss his new album, \"Let Your Hair Down.\" PLAY: The Gorillaz, \"The Fall\" Aside from being the best iPad promotion EVER, the Gorillaz's fourth album is also the ultimate road-trip soundtrack. Recorded in one month during the U.S. leg of the band's \"Plastic Beach\" tour, \"The Fall\" replaces singles with instrumental soundscapes. In the hands of a hack, this collection of iPad app experiments would be an insufferable mess. However, Damon Albarn has the chops, curiosity, and cojones to pull of an album that's as trippy as it is engaging. The sound of Albarn's America rolling past his tour bus window (with traveling companion Bobby Womack joining in for a soulful guest spot on \"Bobby in Phoenix\"), \"The Fall\" is a modern-day 8-track tape. It's full of all the open spaces and contradictions that both Gorillaz and America possess. Enjoy the ride \u2014 wherever it takes you. WATCH the music video for \"Phoner to Arizona\" by Gorillaz. PLAY: Soundtrack, \"Glee: The Music presents The Warblers\" For all of you unable to stomach more \"Glee\"-ification of your favorite pop songs, you may have mixed feelings about the Warblers, the hit show's faux a cappella group. Your biggest gripe will probably be that the album is not a cappella. Stings, drums, and synths sneak their way onto the tracks. Still, actor-singer Darren Criss leads his Dalton Academy boys (and the real-life university a cappella group supporting him, the Tufts Beelzebubs) through some pretty astounding vocal arrangements. Purists, Dave Grohl, and Kings of Leon will continue to cringe as yet more pop music gets the \"Glee\" treatment. Still, fans of pop vocals will find the Warblers hard to resist. And I gotta say, Paul McCartney's \"Silly Love Songs\" is a lot easier to stomach with the '70s cheese turned off. WATCH The Warblers perform \"Teenage Dream\" on \"Glee.\" PLAY: The Belle Brigade, \"The Belle Brigade\" Some groups' debuts are so positively perfect that it's hard to imagine a world where their music didn't exist. The Belle Brigade is a perfect band with perfect songs, and perfect harmonies. They sing like they share the same DNA (they do), they write infectious melodies like the masters (their granddad is film composer John Williams), and they play with the urgency of a young brother and sister who have the whole world riding on their success and their whole lives in front of them. My God, it just doesn't get any better than this. \"The Belle Brigade\" is the kind of album you wait for months to arrive. And it's the album that will keep you hanging on for that day when something better comes along. WATCH the lyric video for \"Where Not to Look for Freedom\" by The Belle Brigade. PLAY: DJ Quik, \"Book of David\" DJ Quik will be the first tell you that he has no interest in hip-hop anymore. And why should he? No one is still making hip-hop like DJ Quik. The Compton rapper and remixer's star has been overshadowed by those of his many West Coast contemporaries, including Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre, who play to the camera and the mainstream. But DJ Quik is an artist first. \"Book of David\" is a welcome return to the funk and old school scratch and swagger missing from most of today's self-conscious hip-hop. DJ Quik says that he's turning to film scores from here on out. Let's hope that he's not serious. West Coast rap needs to him to keep it real.

        "article": "The Washington Post's David Fahrenthold explains the latest revelations about how Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump may have violated the IRS's rules regarding charitable funds. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) On Tuesday morning, The Washington Post published a story headlined: \"Trump used $258,000 from his charity to settle legal problems.\" Written by David Fahrenthold, who has reported extensively about the Trump Foundation, the piece details how Trump directed more than $250,000 of the charity's money to help pay fees related to his businesses. Those payments could qualify as \"self-dealing\" and violate laws governing how the leaders of nonprofit organizations can use the money they receive in donations. On Tuesday night, Trump communications director Jason Miller issued a statement disputing Fahrenthold's reporting. Sort of. Actually, not really. Here's Miller's full statement: In typical Washington Post fashion, they\u2019ve gotten their facts wrong. It is the Clinton Foundation that is set up to make sure the Clintons personally enrich themselves by selling access and trading political favors. The Trump Foundation has no paid board, no management fees, no rent or overhead, and no family members on its payroll. There was not, and could not be, any intent or motive for the Trump Foundation to make improper payments. All contributions are reported to the IRS, and all Foundation donations are publicly disclosed. Mr. Trump is generous both with his money and with his time. He has provided millions of dollars to fund his Foundation and a multitude of other charitable causes. The Post\u2019s reporting is peppered with inaccuracies and omissions from a biased reporter who is clearly intent on distracting attention away from the corrupt Clinton Foundation, a vehicle for the Clintons to peddle influence at the expense of the American people. Mr. Trump personally and the Trump Foundation, however, are staying focused on their charitable giving to veterans, the police, children and other deserving recipients.\u201d Before I go through the various ways in which this statement elides and misleads, let me make the most obvious point ever: I work for The Washington Post. I have for the past decade. I know David Fahrenthold and the editors who have worked on his stories. So, that's that. But, even if I didn't work at The Post and I hated Dave, Miller's response to this latest story about Trump's use of the foundation wouldn't pass the smell test. Miller starts off by dumping on The Post's journalism with zero evidence to back up his claim that we got our \"facts wrong.\" When? Where? Who? He quickly segues into a bit of political sleight of hand by insisting that the real story of this campaign is the Clinton Foundation and that the media is ignoring it. But the media isn't ignoring it. Not even close! A quick Google search of \"Washington Post Clinton Foundation\" produces a bevy of results, including an op-ed from The Post's editorial board on Aug. 14 headlined: \"A porous ethical wall between the Clinton Foundation and the State Department.\" It reads, in part: Should Ms. Clinton win in November, she will bring to the Oval Office a web of connections and potential conflicts of interest, developed over decades in private, public and, in the case of her family\u2019s philanthropic work, quasi-public activities. As secretary, she pledged to keep her official world and her family\u2019s foundation separate, and she failed to keep them separate enough. Such sloppiness would not be acceptable in the White House. That's not exactly taking it easy on Clinton and her family foundation. In the second paragraph of his statement, Miller asserts that \"there was not, and could not be, any intent or motive for the Trump Foundation to make improper payments.\" Okay. But that's not what The Post's article alleges. Fahrenthold knows better than to suggest intent or motive; he is simply noting that Trump diverted $258,000 -- money that wasn't his -- given to the foundation to pay for things tied to Trump's businesses. Those are facts. And they simply are not in dispute, not even by Miller. (More on that below.) As for Miller's claim that Trump has \"provided millions of dollars to fund his Foundation and a multitude of other charitable causes,\" it's important to remember that Fahrenthold has been asking the Trump campaign and the foundation to document some -- any! -- of those personal donations for months now. They have refused, forcing him to call or email each charity one by one to try to track the donations. If Trump is as generous with his own money as Miller says he is, it would be the easiest thing in the world to release a list of the various charities Trump has given to and the dollar amounts associated with those donations. Right? (Note: Last year, Trump released a list of $102 million in charitable donations. But the campaign later acknowledged that not a single dollar of that money came from Trump's own pocket.) Then we get to Miller's final paragraph. \"The Post\u2019s reporting is peppered with inaccuracies and omissions from a biased reporter who is clearly intent on distracting attention away from the corrupt Clinton Foundation,\" he writes. The problem? Miller goes on to list a total of zero inaccuracies or omissions in either Fahrenthold's latest report or any of his work on the Trump Foundation. If Fahrenthold's work is rife with these errors, why not note one or two just to bolster your point? I think I know the answer. You probably do, too. And then there is the name-calling -- the assertion that Fahrenthold is a \"biased reporter\" who is intentionally misleading the public to distract from the problems with the Clinton Foundation. \"Bias\" is a nasty word tossed around all too often these days about reporters, almost always with too little and, by that I mean no, proof of the claim. A reporter isn't biased because you don't like the facts he or she has uncovered or because those facts don't comport with your broader vision of this race. The attempt to disqualify reporters based on wholly unverified claims of \"bias\" is corrosive to our democracy. I get that attacking reporters has become a sound strategy for both parties. But they do so at the expense of one of the hallmarks of a healthy democracy. Miller's statement is far from the only attempt in this campaign to discredit a reporter with a baseless set of charges. And it certainly won't be the last. But Fahrenthold deserves better for his dogged reporting aimed at informing voters about their choice in the coming election.",

        "article": "By JAMES RUTENBERG and JERE HESTER Wednesday, May 7th 1997, 2:02AM Two sets of New Jersey parents were torn apart by grief and unanswered questions yesterday after their children star-crossed young lovers forbidden to marry killed themselves. \"They've been trying to go over everything that's been happening in the last few weeks to see if there were any signs,\" said Margery Montagna, a friend of 18-year-old Anne Marie Martinez' parents, Raymond and Joanne. Raymond Martinez broke into his Saddle Brook garage Monday night too late to save his daughter and Chris Petersen, 24, who were slumped in Anne Marie's 1991 Nissan 240 SX. The motor was running, the windows were closed and rock music blared from the radio. \"We tried to revive them, but they were dead,\" said Sgt. Robert McNally. \"They looked like they had fallen asleep.\" The license-plate holder on the sports car that became the young couple's tomb was embossed with the words \"Chris Loves Anne Marie, December 5, 1994\" apparently the day of their first date. The couple had been grappling with her parents' refusal to allow their daughter to marry Petersen, friends said. \"They wanted her to finish her schooling and get her career going,\" said Montagna. \"They weren't too happy with the relationship. They didn't think he was right.\" Law enforcement sources said Martinez and Petersen, the father of a 4-year-old daughter from a past relationship, had been in and out of substance-abuse programs. \"The two of them had drug dependency, and it led them astray,\" said one source. In a suicide note, found near a package of rolling paper, Martinez reportedly referred to her inability to kick drugs. A local school official said she had visited a substance-abuse counselor before dropping out of Saddle Brook High School in 11th grade. Police said the young couple died of carbon monoxide poisoning, but authorities were awaiting the result of toxicology tests to see if the two were on drugs. Petersen had worked for the telephone company until January and had been unemployed since, a law enforcement source said. It was a far cry from his high school glory days as senior class president. \"He was very popular,\" schools Superintendent Harry Groveman said. \"But there were problems. He was not academically motivated.\" The caption under his yearbook picture noted that Petersen liked hockey and was nicknamed \"Bart\" apparently because of his Bart Simpson-like spiked blond hairdo. Petersen's family was in seclusion yesterday and couldn't be reached for comment. Martinez' family yesterday described her as a vibrant young woman who had enrolled in beauty school three weeks ago. \"My sister was the best person in the whole world,\" said Darlene Martinez, 29. \"But they were wrong for each other.\" Still, Montagna, who comforted Martinez' parents after the bodies were discovered, said the parents never envisioned a double suicide. \"They could have just gotten in the car and driven to get married,\" she said. A .22-caliber rifle and a 12-gauge shotgun were found in the backseat of the car, with a garbage bag of clean clothes, some candy and cigarets, police said. A .22-caliber bullet was found on the front driver's seat; on the bloodstained front carpet were a pen knife and a bloody sock. Cops had no immediate explanation for the discoveries but said they played no role in the double suicide.",

        "article": "A year ago, Aereo was the future of television. Today, the future is bleak for the Boston-based tech startup. The company has been on a downward spiral since its digital recording and streaming service was found to violate copyright law by the US Supreme Court in June. Earlier in November, Aereo closed its Boston office and laid off 43 of its local staff. Late Thursday, facing lawsuits from two dozen television companies, it declared bankruptcy. In a letter posted on the company website, Aereo chief executive Chet Kanojia said the move would avoid \u201cthe extensive cost and distraction of defending drawn out litigation in several courts.\u201d Bankruptcy \u201cessentially freezes all existing lawsuits against the company,\u201d said Bruce Ewing, a New York intellectual property lawyer who has followed the case. \u201cIt may be that Aereo is hoping to somehow go through the bankruptcy process and emerge on the other end free of any liabilities to the broadcasters. Whether or not that is possible is unknowable at this point.\u201d According to its Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in the US District Court in Manhattan, the tech company could either wait for regulatory changes to make its business model viable or opt to sell \u201call or substantially all of its assets,\u201d including intellectual property such as technology patents and software designs. Can a daring entrepreneur from Newton and his team of technologists upend the way we watch TV? Only if the Supreme Court sees it their way. Four Aereo investors either declined or did not reply to requests for comment, and the company declined to comment on its future plans beyond Kanojia\u2019s public letter. However, in its bankruptcy filing, Aereo said it \u201chas also been formulating new legal strategies and potential new business models consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision.\u201d It added that actions by federal regulators may give it a legal way to use its technology but said the timing of those actions was \u201cultimately uncertain.\u201d Dan Rayburn, an online video industry analyst, said he was skeptical Aereo could attract new investors because its subscriber base was relatively small. He also doubted the company could make much selling its intellectual property. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth a lot, if anything,\u201d Rayburn said. \u201cWhat technology did they have? They had small antennas that pick up over-the-air signals.\u201d The company, which gave subscribers the ability to watch broadcast television on their computers or mobile devices and record and store programs in the cloud, had been entangled in litigation for years. TV networks and cable companies argued that Aereo stole the same programming that cable networks had to pay for. Despite some early legal victories, the Supreme Court rejected Aereo\u2019s defense in a 6-to-3 ruling. The company suspended its service three days after the Supreme Court ruling and issued refunds to its customers in a dozen metropolitan areas, including Boston. At the end of 2013, the company had around 80,000 subscribers, who paid $8 to $12 a month to stream over-the-air programming from the major broadcast networks to their devices. Aereo said in its bankruptcy filings that it has appointed Lawton Bloom of Argus Management Corp. in New York as its \u201cchief restructuring officer.\u201d Kanojia is the largest single shareholder in Aereo, according to the bankruptcy filing. His stake amounts to 42.3 percent of the company. \u2022 Aereo ending operations, laying off 43 in Boston \u2022 Innovation Economy: Decision in Aereo case won\u2019t stop tech disruptors \u2022 Aereo\u2019s use of TV fare found to break copyright law \u2022 Aereo has few options for a Plan B, but now it needs one \u2022 Supreme Court expresses skepticism on Aereo \u2022 Archive: Aereo wants a TV revolution, if the Supreme Court will let it",

        "article": "FORTUNE \u2014 Morgan Stanley is either the cleanest bank on Wall Street, or it\u2019s living in denial. Talk of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s $13 billion settlement has dramatically upped the expectations of what banks may pay to put the financial crisis behind them. On Thursday, in a regulatory filing, Goldman Sachs GS estimated it may spend $4 billion more than it has already budgeted for settlements and fines and lawyers fees, up from $3.5 billion three months ago. In the last week, nearly all of the large banks have disclosed billions in potential additional legal expenses. JPMorgan Chase JPM puts that number at $5.7 billion. Bank of America BAC , which recently was found guilty of selling defective mortgages, isn\u2019t far behind at $5.1 billion. Citigroup C says $5 billion. MORE: Morgan Stanley strengthens while Goldman disappoints The one exception is Morgan Stanley MS . In its quarterly report, which the company filed with the SEC on Monday, the bank left blank what its additional legal expenses could be. Instead it said it didn\u2019t think the cost would be \u201cmaterial\u201d to its business. Banks don\u2019t have to disclose those costs, and accounting for legal expenses is murky. Financial institutions have reserves, but they don\u2019t tell investors how much. Nonetheless, banks, like all firms, are supposed to alert investors if they know of any upcoming costs that could impact earnings. That\u2019s what\u2019s led to the disclosures of potential additional legal expenses. Morgan Stanley declined to comment. Some people believe that the legal disclosure is meaningless, because there is no way to know how much a bank has put away for what. That could be why Morgan Stanley doesn\u2019t state a figure. Nonetheless, the lack of legal disclosure likely means that Morgan Stanley believes it will spend far less defending its financial crisis conduct than rivals. MORE: The issue holding up JPMorgan\u2019s $13 billion payout That may be right. As we have noted, Morgan Stanley has completely avoided any prosecution from the federal government tied to the financial crisis. It\u2019s the only major bank not to have paid a fine to Uncle Sam. That, of course, could make it the low-hanging fruit for prosecutors. And while Morgan Stanley never made mortgage loans directly to consumers, it sold just as many risky bonds tied to home loans as Goldman and others. Morgan Stanley also disclosed earlier this week that insurer AIG AIG is likely to sue the bank for as much as $3.7 billion for losses on mortgage bonds. Still, Morgan Stanley, more than any of its rivals, appears to be actually complying with the spirit of Dodd-Frank and getting out of risky businesses, rather than trying to find a way around the new laws. That has made it somewhat of a poster child for financial reform. Perhaps it\u2019s also hoping that its post-financial crisis good behavior will let it off the hook for past misdeeds. So far it appears to be working.",

        "article": "The State Department is conducting three separate investigations of the shooting, and on Monday the F.B.I. said it was sending a team to Baghdad to compile evidence for possible criminal prosecution. Neither the State Department nor Blackwater would comment on Monday about the 15-page report, but both said their representatives would address it on Tuesday in testimony before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, whose Democratic staff produced the document. Based on 437 internal Blackwater incident reports as well as internal State Department correspondence, the report said Blackwater\u2019s use of force was \u201cfrequent and extensive, resulting in significant casualties and property damage.\u201d Among those scheduled to testify Tuesday are Erik Prince, a press-shy former Navy Seal who founded Blackwater a decade ago, and several top State Department officials. The committee report places a significant share of the blame for Blackwater\u2019s record in Iraq on the State Department, which has paid Blackwater more than $832 million for security services in Iraq and elsewhere, under a diplomatic security contract it shares with two other companies, DynCorp International and Triple Canopy. Blackwater has reported more shootings than the other two companies combined, but it also currently has twice as many employees in Iraq as the other two companies combined. In the case of the Christmas Eve killing, the report says that an official of the United States Embassy in Iraq suggested paying the slain bodyguard\u2019s family $250,000, but a lower-ranking official said that such a high payment \u201ccould cause incidents with people trying to get killed by our guys to financially guarantee their family\u2019s future.\u201d Blackwater ultimately paid the dead man\u2019s family $15,000. In another fatal shooting cited by the committee, an unidentified State Department official in Baghdad urged Blackwater to pay the victim\u2019s family $5,000. The official wrote, \u201cI hope we can put this unfortunate matter behind us quickly.\u201d The committee report also cited three other shootings in which Blackwater officials filed misleading reports or otherwise tried to cover up the shootings. Since mid-2006, Blackwater has been responsible for guarding American diplomats in and around Baghdad, while DynCorp has been responsible for the northern part of the country and Triple Canopy for the south. State Department officials said last week that Blackwater had run more than 1,800 escort convoys for American diplomats and other senior civilians this year and its employees had discharged their weapons 57 times. Blackwater was involved in 195 instances of gunfire from 2005 until early September, a rate of 1.4 shootings a week, the report says. In 163 of those cases, Blackwater gunmen fired first. The report also says Blackwater gunmen engaged in offensive operations alongside uniformed American military personnel in violation of their State Department contract, which states that Blackwater guards are to use their weapons only for defensive purposes. It notes that Blackwater\u2019s contract authorizes its employees to use lethal force only to prevent \u201cimminent and grave danger\u201d to themselves or to the people they are paid to protect. \u201cIn practice, however,\u201d the report says, \u201cthe vast majority of Blackwater weapons discharges are pre-emptive, with Blackwater forces firing first at a vehicle or suspicious individual prior to receiving any fire.\u201d The report cites two instances in which Blackwater gunmen engaged in tactical military operations. One was a firefight in Najaf in 2004 during which Blackwater employees set up a machine gun alongside American and Spanish forces. Later that year, a Blackwater helicopter helped an American military squad secure a mosque from which sniper fire had been detected. Blackwater has dismissed 122 of its employees over the past three years for misuse of weapons, drug or alcohol abuse, lewd conduct or violent behavior, according to the report. It has also terminated workers for insubordination, failure to report incidents or lying about them, and publicly embarrassing the company. One employee was dismissed for showing signs of post-traumatic stress disorder. The Senate on Monday gave final approval, 92 to 3, to a defense policy bill that included the establishment of an independent commission to investigate private contractors operating in Iraq and Afghanistan. The bill, which must be reconciled with a House version, faces a veto threat because it includes an expansion of federal hate-crimes laws. James Risen, David Stout and David M.

        "article": "We love to listen to presidents talk in unscripted moments, and President Obama's recent sidebar with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev certainly fits the bill. Obama's comments about missile defense -- \"after my election, I have more flexibility,\" he told Medvedev -- may well rank with the classics, though it's not the first time a world leader has been caught talking out of school. Nor is it the first time for Obama or his administration. Remember what Vice President Joe Biden said after the signing of the health care law? This Week has compiled nine classic \"hot mic\" moments, starting with the latest addition: -- \"President Obama's critics are having a field day with a remark he made to Russia's president when he thought his microphone was off. 'Give me space,' Obama said. 'This is my last election. After my election, I have more flexibility' to deal with missile defense. Critics say it makes Obama look arrogant about a second term, and weak on Russia. Of course, he's hardly the first president to feel the sting of an unexpectedly hot mic ... -- Disgraced President Richard Nixon was apparently a bit self-conscious as he waited to announce his resignation on TV in 1974. He was caught on tape referring to White House photographer Ollie Atkins, and saying, 'I'm afraid he'll catch me picking my nose.' -- During a microphone check for a radio address on public schools in 1984, President Ronald Reagan decided to have a little fun. 'My fellow Americans,' he said, 'I'm pleased to tell you today that I've signed legislation that will outlaw Russia forever. We begin bombing in five minutes.' The audio leaked and, this being the tail end of the Cold War, his Soviet counterparts were not amused. -- George W. Bush and Dick Cheney shared vulgar whispers during the 2000 presidential campaign, when Bush pointed at New York Times' Adam Clymer and said the reporter was a 'major league a------.' Cheney replied: 'Yeah. Big time.' -- In 2005, French journalists overheard President Jacques Chirac badmouthing British food to Russia's Vladimir Putin and Germany's Gerhard Schroeder. 'The only thing [the British] have ever done for European agriculture is mad cow' disease, Chirac said. 'You can't trust people who cook as badly as that.' A British chef responded: 'A man full of bile is not fit to pronounce on food.' -- At a 2006 G-8 summit, President George W. Bush uncorked his frustration over the conflict between Israel and Islamic militant group Hezbollah in Lebanon. Incorrectly assuming his mic was off, Bush told British Prime Minister Tony Blair: 'See the irony is what they need to do is get Syria to get Hezbollah to stop doing this shit and it's over.' -- Hip-hop star Kanye West wasn't the only one who suffered embarrassment after he stormed onto the stage at the 2009 MTV Music Awards, stealing singer Taylor Swift's big moment. President Obama commented on the fiasco in what he thought was an off-the-record portion of a CNBC interview, saying that West had behaved like a 'jackass.' -- Okay, so Joe Biden isn't president. But he is a heartbeat away. And in 2010, after introducing Obama during a ceremony marking the signing of the health-care reform law, Biden turned to his boss and said: 'This is a big f------ deal.' White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs made light of Biden's F-bomb, tweeting, 'yes, Mr. Vice President, you're right.' -- French President Nicolas Sarkozy found himself in hot water after saying at a G20 summit last November that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a 'liar.' Sarkozy was discussing the Palestinian bid for recognition at the U.N. with Obama, who caught flak for chiming in: 'You're fed up, but I have to deal with him every day.'\"",

        "article": "A recent Thursday found me and a male friend huddled over his iPhone. It was 11 a.m. sharp, and the men\u2019s skate-clothing label Supreme was having its weekly drop of new merchandise. My friend, a Supreme fan, has admitted in the past that he goes into something of a fugue state during its weekly online drop, clicking near blindly to secure himself something, anything, before it\u2019s gone. This time, I was a fellow traveler. Established in 1994 in New York, Supreme has developed a cult following among not just skaters but also fashion folk, artists, musicians and streetwear-obsessed suburban teenagers. Known for its limited inventory, its clothing\u2019s high resale value and its many collaborations with other brands, Supreme releases its merchandise on Thursday mornings in stores and online. Many of the items \u2014 most of them staples like hoodies, caps and T-shirts \u2014 sell out almost immediately, creating an enticing scarcity. My experience was no different. As I scrolled through the Supreme app with my friend, I found that things were moving too fast for me. Before I could decide whether I wanted something or not, it was sold out. Dark blue Supreme x Clarks wallabees? Gone. A Betty Boop baseball shirt? Gone. A red polka-dot short-sleeve button-down? Gone. I felt slightly embarrassed. This might not have been the thing for me, but nevertheless, here I was: a 40-year-old cisgender straight wife and mom who shopped like a 19-year-old skater. A LOT OF girls are tomboys, and growing up I definitely was one, but what began in my childhood as a relatively unconscious, oppositional response, a sort of sensitivity of the body \u2014 the lacy collar on that dress was itchy; the strap on those patent leather Mary Janes gave me blisters \u2014 developed over the years into a more intentional style inclination. At 12, I went to see \u201cMarried to the Mob\u201d and decided I wanted a haircut like Matthew Modine\u2019s. It\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t think Michelle Pfeiffer\u2019s perm in the movie looked amazing (she played a hairdresser, after all), but Mr. Modine\u2019s preppy, 1920s-style cut seemed to me exponentially more appealing. Unlike Ms. Pfeiffer\u2019s femme resplendence, which looked even to my novice tween eyes like a ton of work with plenty of room for error, Mr. Modine\u2019s boyishness appeared effortless, and therefore cool. It was, at least seemingly, low stakes, and by virtue of that very carelessness became a look in itself. As I discovered once I got the haircut, it took some effort to maintain, with my wavy hair erupting into a mushroom cloud instead of the hoped-for straight, vaguely New Wave-ish cap. But while this apparent failure might have deterred me, it actually became a spur. The thing was, I didn\u2019t particularly want to be a boy, and I wasn\u2019t trying to approximate any look fully or exactly; what I did want was to look like a girl who was obviously lifting particular boyish elements and incorporating them into her style. That way, fashion could be free to become purely a signifier, a concept, and the more pared-down, simple and iconic the better. Fashion that so clearly and self-consciously borrows its language could never be accused of failing, of getting something wrong \u2014 as I would surely be, I thought, if I tried to look more overtly feminine. Over the years, I plucked many such signifiers from the world of casual, lightly subversive men\u2019s wear and planted them in my outfits. It was crucial that none of these items be dandyish or precious or conservative. I would have never worn a suit or tie, for instance. Instead: a fuzzy oversize Steven Alan cardigan that put me in mind of Kurt Cobain\u2019s \u201cUnplugged\u201d vintage sweater; a thin gold chain, worn with a plain T-shirt and hitting midsternum, reminiscent to me of that worn by Fassbinder\u2019s young hustler character in 1975\u2019s \u201cFox and His Friends\u201d; a Rodarte sweatshirt I bought at a sample sale after I saw a paparazzi picture of Drake wearing it at a club; clear-framed, oversize glasses of the sort Marc Jacobs used to wear in his slobby-hot days in the mid-2000s; and so on.",

        "article": "Florida Sen. Marco Rubio built his presidential campaign around an optimistic vision of uplift, both for the Republican Party and the nation. But when he spoke to reporters Saturday, with polls showing him trailing in his home state and the nation\u2019s television screens showing violence at a Donald Trump rally, he appeared deflated and despondent. \u201cThis is a frightening, grotesque, and disturbing development in American politics,\u201d Rubio said of violence. \u201cWe are being ripped apart at the seams now,\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019m sad for this country. This is supposed to be the example to the world of how a republic functions and instead people are watching third-world images last night coming out of Chicago.\u201d Asked if he would support Trump if, as many now expect, he becomes the Republican nominee, Rubio appeared to become even more emotional. \u201cI still at this moment continue to intend to support the Republican nominee,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cBut\u2014getting harder every day.\u201d It\u2019s been a head-spinning month and a half for Rubio and his campaign, with what passed for success in Iowa followed by an excruciating debate performance in New Hampshire. After appearing to regain his standing in South Carolina, his momentum evaporated in contest after contest in the two weeks afterward. After avoiding Trump for the better part of a year, he questioned the front-runner\u2019s manhood, only to abruptly reverse course. At Thursday\u2019s Republican debate he declined to directly condemn the violence against protesters at Trump\u2019s rallies. Then he did just that after the violence in Chicago. With his campaign facing what is at best an existential test and potentially a useless endeavor in Florida, Rubio said he can\u2019t think beyond Tuesday\u2019s winner-take-all contest. \u201cI literally don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m having for lunch or dinner today,\u201d the candidate said. \u201cI don\u2019t even know my schedule today. I just go where they take me today.\u2026 I intend to win Florida.\u201d But increasingly that seems to be out of reach, as he trails in poll after poll\u2014often by double-digit margins. At Thursday\u2019s debate, Rubio\u2019s campaign said he sought to return his campaign to its lofty rhetorical origins in hopes of securing another come-from-behind victory. But there was another unstated reason\u2014if Rubio was going to lose, it was going to be as the optimistic candidate he had been, not the insult-firing candidate he\u2019d become. \u201cWe are now a nation where people hate each other,\u201d he said Sunday at a campaign event. \u201cIf we continue at the road we\u2019re on, we\u2019re going to fracture at the seams.\u201d In Miami, Rubio told the story of an older gentleman from South Florida who sits outside a polling place every day holding a sign supporting him. \u201cFor him, I symbolize all the sacrifices that his generation made so their children could have a better life than themselves,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cThat gentleman has not given up on me and I am not going to give up on him.\u201d \u201cFor tonight, we wanted to bring this back to why is Marco running for president, to remind voters here in Florida why they elected him in 2010, and I think we accomplished that,\u201d Rubio communications director Alex Conant said after the debate. It seemed as though Rubio\u2019s plan was more finite. \u201cIf you are a Republican primary voter in Ohio and you want to defeat Donald Trump, your best chance in Ohio is John Kasich,\u201d Conant told CNN Friday, a sentiment Rubio also echoed to reporters. The sentiment is consistent with the strategy offered by former GOP nominee Mitt Romney to deprive Trump of delegates to keep him from the nomination at all cost. The most recent RealClearPolitics average of Florida public polls shows Rubio 18 points behind Trump in his home state, a huge margin to make up if accurate, given the amount of early voting in the state. If Rubio loses Florida but Kasich wins Ohio, hope will remain that Trump can be stopped at the Republican convention in Cleveland. The reasons for Rubio\u2019s struggles are myriad, some with and others outside of his control. A candidate for whom message became an organizing principle lost control of his public image. A campaign centered around friendly television appearances never built up a robust ground game and was unprepared for the rise of a candidate who dominated the news conversation. The baby-faced candidate chose to dive into the mud with Trump and did lasting damage to his call for mature decision-making. Rubio positioned himself as a candidate who could unite all corners of the GOP and lead the party to a new, more inclusive era. He planned to campaign in the Republican Party elders had called for after its 2012 losses, one that never materialized. Instead, Rubio\u2019s elevated call for a \u201cNew American Century\u201d was subsumed by the baser instincts of the GOP base. This article was originally published on Time.com.",

        "article": "\u201cThere, it\u2019s 5,000, 6,000 people spilling into the square outside,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a rock concert.\u201d The difference between her receptions on the two sides of the Atlantic may be due partly to her nationality, as Ms. Emin pointed out \u2014 after all, \u201cJeff Koons isn\u2019t famous\u201d in Britain, she said. Even so, given that the New York art world has become much bigger and more international in scope in recent years, it is notable that an artist who has achieved Ms. Emin\u2019s level of stardom in Europe should struggle to make inroads here. This is Ms. Emin\u2019s fourth solo show in New York. So far it has not received much attention from reviewers, and Rachel Lehmann, an owner of the gallery, said that 10 of the 53 works there \u2014 which include many single-edition prints and embroidered cloths, along with a handful of sculptures and a short animated film \u2014 have sold so far. By contrast, when the White Cube held an exhibition of similar pieces by Ms. Emin six months ago, about three-quarters of them were sold within a week, according to Tim Marlow, a director of that gallery (who cautioned against reading too much into the comparison). That opening was a major event in the British art world and generated a great deal of press. Rachel Campbell-Johnston, the chief art critic for The Times of London, wrote, \u201cThis new show should have been the one she presented at the biennale\u201d in Venice. The Evening Standard\u2019s review raved about the animation piece in particular and declared that \u201cno museum exhibition about feminist art, art about the body or sexual identity in art will be complete without this work.\u201d Ms. Emin\u2019s new prints and embroideries are rendered in the spare and sketchlike style she has taken to calling \u201cmy salty Egon Schiele line.\u201d (\u201cImagine if you would there\u2019s salt poured on the paper, and you draw right over it,\u201d she said poolside, drawing an imaginary line with her finger on the arm of her chaise longue.) The works explore perennial themes of Ms. Emin\u2019s: sex and loneliness, sex and self-reproach. One print depicts a dog and a woman having sex, with the scrawled text: \u201cNo You Were A Dog But Thing Is I Was Less.\u201d Ms. Emin said that the longer critical and commercial discrepancies exist between her status in Europe and America, the more puzzled she is. For years she attributed it to uneasiness over several autobiographical video pieces and essays in which she discussed being raped as a teenager and having two abortions, though now she doubts it is that simple. \u201cI\u2019m not mourning it,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cOver here, I\u2019ve never really shown in museums at all.\u201d She noted: \u201cThe Guggenheim hasn\u2019t bought my work, but I think they received a donated piece. The Tate last year bought and displayed a whole room of my work.\u201d The Walker Art Center in Minneapolis exhibited her tent, which was not yet famous, in a group show in 1995 \u2014 but she did not want it sharing a room \u201cwith all these little pieces by everybody else,\u201d she said, and tried to pull it from the exhibition. \u201cThey stopped me when I was dragging it down the escalator. Richard Flood, the curator, said, \u2018With your attitude, you\u2019ll never show in this country.\u2019 I told him with that attitude I didn\u2019t want to, although actually for the time being he was right.\u201d Ms. Emin\u2019s art is so closely bound up in her persona that detractors are wont to say that the artist herself, or at least her endless capacity for self-reference, is the turnoff. She has produced works and shows titled \u201cThe Tracey Files,\u201d \u201cThe Tracey Emin Museum\u201d and \u201cCV,\u201d which stands for two words \u2014 the second of them is \u201cvernacular\u201d and the first is unprintable. She has made hundreds of nude self-portraits, including \u201cI\u2019ve Got It All,\u201d a photograph in which her loins are obscured only by piles of money, which she is either giving birth to or forcing inside her vagina. Mr. Marlow said her approach has been viewed as \u201cperhaps a bit confrontational\u201d for the American market. Ms. Lehmann suggested that sexism was a cause: \u201cThe male museum directors and curators were extremely hostile, which didn\u2019t help Tracey get the right attention,\u201d she said. Nancy Spector, the chief curator of the Guggenheim Museum, pointed out the degree to which Ms. Emin\u2019s appeal as both an artist and a personality had its roots in contemporary British culture. \u201cSo much of her public persona is about the appearances, the tabloids following her, the confessional nature of her work,\u201d Ms. Spector said. \u201cI think of Tracey\u2019s work as having a lot in common with the sort of reality television that came out of Great Britain.\u201d But even Ms. Emin appears to have reached a point of saturation \u2014 and, finally, the capacity to be embarrassed \u2014 with her own oversharing. Last Saturday, at a public reading at the University Settlement on Eldridge Street from her collection of personal essays, \u201cStrangeland,\u201d that was part of the performance art festival Performa, Ms. Emin prefaced one of several passages about her promiscuous youth with the declaration, \u201cI\u2019m afraid this one\u2019s going to be quite stupid,\u201d and then refused to read the last few paragraphs. Ms. Emin acknowledged that there is a downside to making such an open book of herself. \u201cPeople see me in the street and cuddle me,\u201d she said, scrunching her face into the asymmetrical squint that has long been a trademark, at least in Britain. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult, because I don\u2019t like being touched.\u201d A version of this article appears in print on November 14, 2009, on Page C1 of the New York edition with the headline: Quite Big In Britain, Not Quite In the U.S. Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe",

        "article": "Jewish American history books don't usually evoke images of the California Gold Rush. But among the waves of risk-takers flooding the Sierra foothills in the late 1840s and early '50s were masses of Jews from Germany willing to brave a rough-hewn life in order to stake their claim, pan for gold and hit the fiscal big time. \"Much of (this California history) is omitted from most of what you'd call general history books of Jewish history, which really means New York Jews, \" says Marc Dollinger, who holds the Richard and Rhoda Goldman endowed chair in Jewish Studies and Social Responsibility at San Francisco State University. Dollinger and Ava F. Khan, a historian of western Jewish life who has served as a visiting professor of history at UC Berkeley and UC Davis, have edited a large-format book, \"California Jews\" (Brandeis University Press), which spotlights some of this hidden history. The book's 15 essays highlight other lesser-known aspects of Jewish history as well: the influence of women; the lives of ordinary people; the efforts of Jews to help the Japanese interned during World War II; and the denial by Jews of the Israel expatriates who settled in Southern California. It tells the story of how the Gold Rush adventurers settled down and worked at assimilating into Bay Area society. It also tells how, a half century later, Eastern European Jews settled in Los Angeles, some of them becoming prime movers in Hollywood. Both groups found a kind of speedy mobility in the Golden State that allowed members to achieve power, place and financial success that their spiritual brothers and sisters on the East Coast would take decades to accomplish. Dollinger says that he and Kahn conceived of the book as \"the next generation's approach to California Jewish history.\" That meant building on the past 40 years of scholarship, yet not using a traditional top-down approach - highlighting movement leaders - but from a \"social history\" angle: telling the stories of ordinary people. It also meant, Dollinger says, ensuring the presence of women \"both as writers and as subjects of study, and (examining) the influence of women in what has traditionally been seen as a man's world.\" That subject is covered in the essay \"120 Years of Women's Activism,\" co- written by Kahn and Professor Glenna Matthews, a visiting scholar in the Institute of Regional and Urban Development at UC Berkeley. (Dollinger notes that California has two female Jewish U.S. senators: Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer.) Dollinger and Kahn's modern approach also led them, Dollinger says, to tackle some formerly taboo subjects, such as the longtime - and controversial - presence of Israelis in California (\"Kibbutz San Fernando\"). Dollinger says that American Jews were reluctant to acknowledge the presence of large numbers of Jews who were born in Israel and lived in a kibbutz society but chose to live in Southern California. They didn't want to admit that Jews born in what was considered the Promised Land would leave Israel permanently. The organized Jewish community in California \"spent a lot of time not reaching out to them, not involving them and not making them public,\" Dollinger said, adding that the Israeli expatriates faced a struggle \"between the promised land of their birth and the promised land of their future.\" It is those issues of assimilation - within and without the Jewish community - and of establishing a presence in a new place that fascinated Kahn and Dollinger. \"Ultimately, as historians we're interested in cultural interaction,\" Dollinger said, \"how people mix elements of their Jewishness with their residence in the Golden State.\" According to Dollinger, one essay, \"Jewish Space and the Place in Venice, \" by Amy Hill Shevitz, discusses how Jews who worship at a synagogue at the beach in Venice (Los Angeles County) \"combine the fact that they're all at the Pacific Ocean, at the beach and in sunny California and the way they practice their Judaism.\" Water, he adds, has \"powerful qualities in Judaism as a ritual purifier.\" It is perhaps the story of the Jewish Hollywood moguls, covered in Felicia Herman's essay, \"Jewish Leaders and the Motion Picture Industry,\" that is both most familiar to the general reader and especially compelling. Dollinger says that it was only in California that Jewish immigrants could move as quickly as they did into positions of authority. In the movie industry, that resulted in an odd juxtaposition as the moguls green-lighted Biblical epics. \"Here we have California Jews defining what it meant to be a Christian to Christian Americans,\" Dollinger says with a laugh. That kind of assimilation had its price, however. Jews have a history of persecution and dislocation; questions of assimilation provoke sharp, sometimes wary responses from hard-liners in that community. The danger of assimilation, is that the original religious or group identity will be lost as its members become part of a larger adopted group. Some types of synagogue architecture imitated Protestant and Catholic church edifices. And Jews in California intermarried with Christians at the highest rate among urban Jews in the country. Dollinger points out that, in the case of German Jews who moved to San Francisco during the Gold Rush, California was their promised land. \"Traditionally, they are criticized for being so assimilationist,\" he says, \"but they were seeing something not seen in most of Jewish history - civil equality in a mostly Christian society.\" The Golden State has been good to Dollinger, 39, a fifth-generation San Franciscan. He lived in the city until age 4, when his family moved to Sherman Oaks in Southern California. He graduated from UC Berkeley in 1986 with a history degree and taught at Pasadena City College for seven years before taking his current job at San Francisco State a year and a half ago. \"My heart and soul has always remained in the Bay Area,\" says Dollinger, who lives in Mill Valley with his wife, Marci, and their two children: Rebecca, 7, and Shanya, 4. \"My wife and I would travel up here every six weeks of our married life, and when we'd land we'd look at each other and say, 'When can we move?'\" Like those who moved before him, Dollinger appears to appreciate how the Golden State gave Jews options - something that he hopes his and Kahn's book reflects. \"California Jews have been given a level of choice that few other American Jews have enjoyed,\" he says. \"Choice around where they live, how they pray, what job they want, how much education they'll receive.\" He adds, \"It took 50 years for a generation of Jews on the East Coast to work through those issues.\"",

They won \u2014 and Lopez scored an EGOT along the way. (MORE: Oscars 2014 Recap: 12 Years a Slave Is King, and Lupita Nyong\u2019o the Princess Bride) \u201cWhen they called our names, what really was going through my mind was how great it was to be going through this with Kristen, who is really my best friend, my wife, and the mother of my kids,\u201d says Lopez. \u201cIt\u2019s a real blessing.\u201d It was also good news for fans of rhyming couplets. The ultra-cute rhyming acceptance speech that the pair delivered was his wife\u2019s concept, says Lopez. In fact, she had come up with the idea \u2014 and convinced her somewhat reluctant husband to play along \u2014 back when they were nominated for a Golden Globe; they didn\u2019t win, however, so they were able to use the same speech on Oscars night. Well, almost: the other awards show was close to Pixar exec John Lasseter\u2019s birthday, which has now passed, so they had to update a \u201cHappy birthday to you\u201d to a \u201cHappy Oscars to you.\u201d (Despite the second line of that couplet, Lopez says not to get too excited. Frozen 2 just rhymes with \u201cyou\u201d; it doesn\u2019t actually exist \u2014 yet.) As for that EGOT, Lopez says there\u2019s been no secret handshake or club induction. (Or is he just not telling us?) \u201cI\u2019m waiting for the email from [most recent EGOTer] Scott Rudin,\u201d he jokes. \u201cI\u2019m really honored to be part of it, but I know it\u2019s just a statistical coincidence.\u201d But the EGOT does help with at least one thing: interior-decorating decisions. Asked where he\u2019ll keep his new statuette, Lopez has an answer ready: \u201cProbably next to the the Emmy, Grammy and Tony!\u201d",

Hart, the researcher who described the coloring. \u201cIt\u2019s a brilliant blue, really pretty spectacular.\u201d Dr. Hart is a field scientist with the Lukuru Foundation, a wildlife research group; his colleagues include his wife, Terese Hart. They report their findings in the journal PLoS One. The researchers found that the monkeys live in the central part of the Democratic Republic of Congo and have a range of about 6,500 square miles. The first lesula seen by researchers was the pet of a schoolgirl. It bore a strong resemblance to another species, the owl-faced monkey, but the unusual coloring made the researchers suspect it was something new. They were able to identify more lesulas in the wild and find hunters with specimens of the monkey. They analyzed tissue samples to confirm that the lesula is in fact genetically distinct from other species. The lesula lives in remote regions that are largely unthreatened by human settlement. But John Hart warned, \u201cUnder the current trends of uncontrolled bush-meat hunting, it could become very endangered.\u201d This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article erroneously included a photograph of a monkey species that is distinct from the newly discovered Cercopithecus lomaniensis, known as the lesula, and the caption described both images incorrectly. The photograph showed a dark-colored male of the species Cercopithecus hamlyni, known as the owl-faced monkey; it did not show a male lesula. The lighter-colored lesula in the photograph that remains is a male, not a female.

        "article": "Why is Donald Trump popular? Travelling around America\u2019s south for his most recent book Deep South, the writer Paul Theroux got some ideas. \u201cIt\u2019s the gun show guys,\u201d he says, sitting in his Hawaii home. \u201cVirtually everything Donald Trump says, you can find on a gun show bumper sticker. Anti-Obama stuff, anti-Muslim stuff, anti-Mexican stuff, anti-immigrant stuff.\u201d The 74-year-old warms to his theme. \u201cGun shows are about hating and distrusting the government \u2026 people who have been oppressed by a bad economy, by outsourcing. They have a lot of legitimate grievances and a lot of imagined grievances. There is this paranoid notion that Washington is trying to take their guns away, take their manhood away, take this symbol of independence away. They feel defeated. They hate the Republican party, too. They feel very isolated.\u201d Theroux reflects on Trumpmania dominating the Republican primaries and caucuses. \u201cIt\u2019s a whole undercurrent of feeling that runs all the way through the United States. The mood I saw in southern gun shows seems to resonate even with educated, white-collar, Massachusetts Republican voters. Because Trump won my state of Massachusetts, he won a fairly sizable majority.\u201d Related: Deep South review \u2013 Paul Theroux\u2019s journey through the southern United States The writer witnessed the striking economic and cultural impact of outsourcing in southern towns such as Alabama\u2019s Greensboro and Allendale. He sharply evokes Flowers Lane\u2019s hovels and trailers, writing: \u201cThe heat made it all the smellier, as of roasted flatulence. It was the smell of poverty, a stink that no one, not even someone in the submerged 20th, could get used to.\u201d Theroux emphasises that 20% of southerners, black and white, below the poverty line need help. \u201cManufacturing has been outsourced. Their jobs have been taken away, so there\u2019s nothing for them to do. They sit crowded together in their shack and watch a jumbly picture on a TV set. It\u2019s very distressing. \u201cYou don\u2019t see that in many other countries. The level of poverty, and the level of despair, too. Of people thinking, \u2018Nothing\u2019s ever going to happen to me. I will never go to college, I will never get healthcare\u2019.\u201d Theroux\u2019s abiding memory of his journey was southern towns with their economic heart ripped out, factories shuttered, from Mississippi to hinterland Arkansas. Southerners complained to him about the unfair effects American trade deals such as Nafta have had, a complaint Trump is now tub-thumping. \u201cTrump was making some kind of clothing line, but it was made in China. He\u2019s a complete hypocrite in virtually everything that he says,\u201d Theroux says scathingly. \u201cI suppose that will come out. He\u2019s hired undocumented workers, he\u2019s manufactured things in China.\u201d Theroux agrees with Bernie Sanders that Trump is a \u201cpathological liar\u201d. He thinks a candidacy-curbing Trump scandal isn\u2019t far off. \u201cTrump is not unstoppable. I think that the Trump campaign will unravel because he\u2019s such a devious man. He is untruthful. People who make that much money in business, and who talk like that, have hid a lot \u2026 I think something will emerge.\u201d Though Theroux is feeling the Bern, he thinks Sanders\u2019 campaign isn\u2019t ultimately going to get enough traction. \u201cIf you say you\u2019re a socialist, or a democratic socialist as Bernie does, people think you have photos of Stalin on your walls. He\u2019s said a lot of the right things, but Americans aren\u2019t ready for that amount of truth.\u201d He is sceptical about Hillary and Bill Clinton. \u201cBill Clinton is the quintessential southern huckster who doesn\u2019t know when to stop,\u201d he says. Visiting Bill\u2019s old stomping ground of Hot Springs, Theroux is trenchant: \u201cStill a disgrace 50 years after Clinton lived in town,\u201d he writes. \u201cLangston looked like a black \u2018location\u2019 in South Africa, ripe for uplift from an NGO, the very sort of place that should have been a target for improvement by the Clinton Global Initiative, but wasn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cBill Clinton is a very complicated character,\u201d Theroux adds, sounding conflicted. \u201cI understood a lot of American politics better by being in the south. Him in particular by going to Hot Springs \u2026 What Dickens called \u2018telescopic philanthropy\u2019, where you look far, far away to look for poor people to help. Why is Clinton not in places like the Ozarks? And the Clinton Foundation has done some very questionable things.\u201d Theroux believes the Republican establishment only have themselves to blame for Trump\u2019s rise. \u201cTrump is the natural reductio ad absurdum of rightwing Republican thinking. Most Republicans echo what Trump says, but in a coded way, the dog whistle. Trump is merely saying out loud what most Republicans think \u2026 Sarah Palin was the Republican\u2019s 2008 vice-presidential candidate. She\u2019s worse than Trump. She\u2019s done nothing, she\u2019s stupider than Trump. Her views are all the same as his.\u201d In Deep South Theroux traces dog-whistle racism back to Ronald Reagan launching his 1980 campaign in the unnerving Mississippi place where civil rights activists James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner were murdered in 1964. \u201cHe did. I\u2019m glad you noticed it. Reagan knew who he was talking to. He was talking about state\u2019s rights, and so forth. He went there deliberately, Philadelphia, Mississippi. It was horrible; Reagan took advantage of this lynching and shooting of three civil rights workers. The memory of that has faded.\u201d He criticises fellow Massachusite Mitt Romney for being so enthusiastic about Trump\u2019s 2012 endorsement after Trump\u2019s \u201cgrotesquely racist\u201d rise to national prominence as a \u201cbirther\u201d. \u201cRomney is totally opportunistic, not authentic at all.\u201d Theroux still believes Obama\u2019s got true grit. \u201cA wonderful president who has done marvellous things \u2013 with healthcare, getting Bin Laden, opening up Cuba, keeping Israel at arm\u2019s length. Probably the best president of my lifetime. And I can remember Eisenhower, Truman \u2026 I wasn\u2019t disappointed by Obama. I know what the limitations are on people who seek power.\u201d Theroux is disappointed that the deep south will vote for the Republicans in November. But he is cautiously optimistic about the south\u2019s future, buoyed by the kindness, generosity, and warmth of people he encountered on his travels. The seasoned global explorer \u2013 who anticipated Tiananmen in the 1988 classic Riding the Iron Rooster \u2013 believes Russia, India, Brazil and China will implode. \u201cI think China\u2019s going to fail \u2026 when China fails, we\u2019ll have to rebuild here in the south.\u201d",

        "article": "Being tall can be a blessing and a curse. And when it comes to shoes, it is almost always the latter. Especially if you're the tallest man in the world. Sultan Kosen, from Turkey, is the current Guinness World Record holder for tallest living male. He hits a towering height of eight feet three inches (2.51 metres). And this week, he was in the town of Vreden, Germany, to see a man about a pair of very large shoes. That man is Georg Wessels, the world's premiere shoemaker for the world's tallest men and women. Wessels told As It Happens host Carol Off that over the years, he has made 25 different pairs of shoes for Kosen. \"Sultan Kosen is a friend of mine for more than seven years, when he was found for the Guinness Book of World Records. I've seen all the tallest men in the world, but he is really the tallest.\" Shoemaker Georg Wessels (right) and Sultan Kosen from Turkey, the Guinness World Record holder for tallest living male at 2.51 metres, pose in front of Wessels' shoe shop in Vreden, Germany, in 2012, after Kosen got his new shoes. (AFP/Getty Images) Wessels doesn't only cater to men. He recalls making a pair of shoes for Sandy Allen, who held the Guinness record for tallest female before she died in 2008. Wessels says he sees emotional reactions from so many of his customers. Abdramane Dembele, the third tallest man in the world at seven feet seven inches (2.32 metres), joined Kosen on this week's trip to Vreden with the singular goal of meeting Wessels. While Kosen is one of Wessels' regulars, it was Dembele's first time at Wessels' shop. \"[Dembele] was crying. [He was] really happy. You can't believe it. It's one of the most important things for people to have good shoes. Especially for giants, it's very, very important.\" Wessels says the vast majority of the world's tallest men and women have medical problems. Many have gigantism, a medical condition that causes excessive growth. Many of his customers have other health problems, including diabetes. Wessels says it causes their feet to become very sensitive to pressure. \"This means you must make really soft shoes. That's something special, to make strong shoes, very softly.\" Shoemaker Georg Wessels (left) chats with Yao Defen, believed to be the tallest woman in Asia at 2.36 m (7ft 8in), as he donates three pairs of much needed new shoes as a gift, at her home in China's eastern province of Anhui in 2006. (Nir Elias/REUTERS) Wessels says he is the eighth generation to carry on the family business of shoemaking, which began in 1745. Wessels decided to cater to tall customers after meeting the tallest Dutch man in history, years ago. \"When I was a young boy more than 60 years ago, [my father and I] met the 'Giant of Amsterdam,\" Albert [Johan] Kramer. I think this was the experience for me to say, I only want to make shoes for the tallest people in the world.\" So, how tall is Georg Wessels? \"I am 1 metre, 80 centimetres [or 5 feet, 10 inches]. I'm a small one.\"",

        "article": "Reporting from Kabul, Afghanistan \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Fighting between NATO forces and insurgents has erupted in the Afghan mountains of Tora Bora, best known as the rugged labyrinth where Osama bin Laden evaded U.S. capture nine years ago. The Western military and Afghan officials said Wednesday that the district of Pachir Agam, in the eastern province of Nangarhar near the Pakistan border, had become a staging ground for Taliban and other fighters preparing attacks on NATO and Afghan troops. At least five Taliban fighters, including two men identified as local commanders, were killed in a NATO airstrike Tuesday night or Wednesday morning, officials said. The raid was part of a campaign to dislodge insurgents from the area. NATO said no civilians were present. The provincial police chief, Ali Shah Paktiawal, said the two commanders, identified as Shir Zaman and Zhir Gull, oversaw \"terrorist operations\" in the district. The NATO force said in a statement that the insurgents were believed to be coordinating the actions of suicide bombers and possibly planning an attack on a border post. It said a cache of weapons that included assault rifles and rocket-propelled grenades was recovered after the strike. Together with Afghanistan's south, the country's east has been a focal point of a U.S. military buildup in recent months. Numerous militant groups are known to operate in the area, including the Taliban, the Haqqani network and fighters affiliated with Al Qaeda. All find refuge in Pakistan between strikes at the NATO force, officials have said. Bin Laden's escape from a Western and Afghan manhunt in December 2001 still rankles U.S. officials, who believe his capture would have changed the course of what has become a long and draining conflict. This year has been the deadliest of the war, with nearly 500 American troops killed. Tora Bora has long been synonymous with missed opportunities. Last year, a report by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee asserted that the Al Qaeda chieftain could have been captured with a better-coordinated assault on the cave-riddled mountain stronghold. Paktiawal, the provincial police chief, said Wednesday that Western and Afghan military operations were continuing in the district of Chaparhar, adjacent to Pachir Agam. A separate raid Tuesday night resulted in the breakup of a 20-member ring responsible for setting roadside mines and the arrests of two other commanders from Pachir Agam, he said. Four more insurgents were seized Wednesday in the Sherzad district of Nangarhar, the police chief said, including one believed to be a Pakistani national.",

        "article": "Shareholder activism sounds so respectable, even noble. The phrase conjures images of good-corporate-governance folk fighting greedy or dysfunctional management in the company\u2019s best interest. While shareholders can be disciplinarians who right the wrongs of abusive directors, many boardroom activists advance some of the most destructive short-term thinking in business today. Sparring with management is popular sport for short-termists seeking to maximize the value of their assets. The game ranges from venal to honorable. \u201cDon\u2019t let the Elliott Hedge Fund pursue its self-serving short-term agenda and destroy the long term [sic] value of your investment,\u201d Hess Chief Executive Officer John Hess wrote in a letter to shareholders last week. T-Mobile CEO John Legere blamed \u201cgreedy hedge funds\u201d after proxy advisors to MetroPCS investors advised shareholders to block a merger with the wireless giant. In February 2012, Apple\u2019s board agreed to majority voting, a once-fringe officer election process that can have unintended consequences and has become more common at large-cap firms. Coincidentally or not, since the resolution was adopted, Apple announced that it will distribute $45 billion in dividends from its $137-plus billion in cash reserves. In a way, it makes sense that shareholders have become so active in corporate gamesmanship. Tussles between directors and equity holders have traditionally favored internal stakeholders; legal protections for shareholders are relatively weak. Aside from voting out management, alleging a breach in duty of care is virtually the only legal standard for holding officers accountable for wrongdoing. An alternative is litigation, and the number of securities class actions has fallen, though settlements reached $2.9 billion in 2012, around double the $1.45 billion awarded in 2011, according to a report by Cornerstone Research and Stanford Law School professor Robert Daines. Still, short-termers have many reasons to be ebullient, as shareholders with relatively weak protections can end-run corporate governance law. These days, companies are at the mercy of a small group of highly engaged investors who want quick results. Blocked mergers and ousters are common. Moreover, spring is proxy season. Corporate lawyers are armed and ready for the \u201cambush,\u201d a way for a small subset of activists to force a particular action by asking shareholders to vote on proposals that merely require written consent by the board to facilitate shareholders to act. Proxy season this year is no different. Shareholder resolutions are as plentiful as new buds. According to the Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance and Financial Regulation, about 600 already have been filed this season. They range from proposals for mandated disclosures of political spending to proxy access, majority voting, independent board chairmen, gender diversity, even compensation protocols. It\u2019s not that these proposals aren\u2019t worthy. It\u2019s just that many are designed to boost shareholder value and few address the problem of short-termism. Shareholder activism stems from a seismic shift that took place in the U.S. economy not so long ago, though long enough ago that its effects have become entrenched in our markets. The privatization of the financial system began in the 1970s. A U.S. trade deficit and rising inflation led to shorter periods for holding investments. When banks emerged as competitors in securities and universal banking became widely available for even the smallest of companies, more companies went public and sold shares to investors who didn\u2019t have the stomach for asset price volatility, as Pavlos Masouros explains in \u201cCorporate Law and Economic Stagnation: How Shareholder Value and Short-termism Contribute to the Decline of the Western Economies.\u201d Amid a 1980s climate of relaxed antitrust law, less stringent merger control and banking deregulation, the way to stave off a hostile takeover was to push up share prices. Pension funds privatized savings for public workers who received massive stock options that overcompensated for lower wages. All this has led to a management culture that discourages long-term investment. Institutional investors who flooded the markets are the big culprits for the onset of short-termism in recent decades. According to a paper published by University of Massachusetts economics professor James Crotty, in the 1950s, households owned 90 percent of corporate stock and held it for long periods. By 2000, households held 42 percent of public shares, while institutions owned 46 percent and were responsible for three-quarters of all trades. In 1960, turnover in the New York Stock Exchange was about 20 percent; now it is more than 100 percent. When shareholders bully management, economic growth can suffer. Pushing for dividends and buyback shares means the company can\u2019t use the funds to invest in growth. Technology firms require three or four years to move a product. Equity funds can\u2019t be turned into capital that can be reinvested. In other words, the cycles of low interest rates and stagnant economic growth of Keynes\u2019s liquidity trap endure, as Masouros noted. For all the talk of short-termism, there has been little in the way of remedies. In Europe, reform has been floated. Brussels is considering loyalty dividends, which reward long-term shareholders. A gradual incremental tax rate on stocks has also been discussed. So have time-phased voting rights. These ideas are unlikely to sell in an economy that deifies the freedom of markets. But in corporate governance, shareholders supposedly are the taskmasters. Since there are more committed investors than shorties, it\u2019s the long-termers\u2019 battle to lose, if they are informed enough to care.",

To briefly recap the situation yet again, Samsung launched its best-ever smartphone this past August, but a defect caused a small number of devices to explode without warning. Samsung recalled the phone and issued replacements that were believed to be safe, but then they began to explode without warning as well. The company was left with no choice but to discontinue the phone and recall all handsets, old and new. On to the new developments on Monday morning. First, the bad news: Samsung still reportedly has absolutely no idea what caused the Galaxy Note 7 to explode. But the good news is that the company is planning to offer even more benefits to consumers who stay loyal to the brand next year. DON\u2019T MISS: iPhone 7 Plus vs Google Pixel speed tests: Android still gets crushed It has now been more than a month since Samsung first began investigating Galaxy Note 7 fires and according to the Wall Street Journal, the company still doesn\u2019t know what caused the handsets to malfunction. \u201cWe recognized that we did not correctly identify the issue the first time and remain committed to finding the root cause,\u201d a Samsung spokesperson told the paper. \u201cOur top priority remains the safety of our customers and retrieving 100% of the Galaxy Note 7 devices in the market.\u201d The Journal also noted that Samsung\u2019s decision not to work more closely with US and international regulators early on may have hindered regulators\u2019 ability to help determine the cause of the fires. But there is some good news to be found this morning as well. Samsung announced on its site that consumers in its home country, South Korea, will be able to trade in their recalled Note 7 handset for a Galaxy S7 model, and they\u2019ll be refunded the difference. That\u2019s old news, of course. Next year, Note 7 buyers who swapped their phones for a Galaxy S7 will be able to trade in their S7 model for a 50 percent discount on the Galaxy Note 8 (or whatever Samsung ends up calling it). The company has run into problems convincing people in South Korea to turn in their recalled Note 7 phones, so this could be just the push they need. This offer is only available in South Korea for the time being, and it\u2019s unclear if Samsung plans to offer Galaxy Note 8 discounts to consumers in other markets.

Primarily, as promised, the minds behind the supercomputer are working hard on medical software that will help doctors do deeper, more accurate and faster diagnoses. But a little bit of that power to compute in adaptive and detailed ways has also been applied to the Academy Awards this year, especially the social conversation around the nominees. It\u2019s not that Watson needs to be entertained. IBM is developing a new tool that leverages social media buzz to help journalists tell a new kind of story and Hollywood to better connect with its audience. The algorithm can\u2019t predict Oscar outcomes, at least not yet, but it can help Hollywood understand earlier what will and won\u2019t work when its movies come out. And it can demonstrate, with far greater reach, how disconnected the Oscars are from the average movie-lover. The idea for the research began as a news-gathering endeavor. \u201cWe started with the concept of 21st Century tools for 21st Century journalism,\u201d says Steve Canepa, general manager for Media and Entertainment Industry at IBM. \u201cThe idea is that by using advanced analytics capabilities and our growing ability to analyze human language, we could improve the journalistic process and to distill insights out of all the data being created in the public.\u201d The end product for now is the Oscar Senti-meter, a collaboration of IBM, University of Southern California Annenberg Innovation Lab and the Los Angeles Times. The Senti-meter has been analyzing millions of tweets since the nominations were announced, creating an aggregated voice of the people about the nominees. It turns out the Hollywood bigwigs who vote don\u2019t always see eye-t0-eye with the people who watch the movies. \u201cThis project was a way to give this event a vox pop perspective,\u201d says Gabriel Kahn director of Future of Journalism at the Annenberg Innovation Lab. \u201cThe odd thing about this project and what makes it interesting, is the Academy Awards are decided by fewer than 6,000 people. So it\u2019s the ultimate elitist event, but it\u2019s followed by the world. We\u2019re looking at the \u2018Hurt Locker\u2019 disconnect here,\u201d referring to the Oscar winner that had not been widely distributed before it got the Academy lift. For instance, one of the movies with the most positive sentiment is \u201cGirl With the Dragon Tattoo,\u201d one at which Oscar shrugged his golden shoulder for a \u201cBest Picture\u201d nomination. Hollywood preferred Steven Spielberg\u2018s \u201cWar Horse.\u201d Twitter: meh. \u201cSpielberg may have been trying a little too hard,\u201d opined one tweep. The Senti-meter discovered that there\u2019s not always a disconnect between the screeners and screened. \u201cMidnight in Paris\u201d is a popular choice among viewers and Oscar voters, which gave the Woody Allen film four nominations, inlcuding \u201cBest Picture.\u201d \u201cThe Help\u201d also had Twitter and Oscar nodding in approval. None of that is cause for much surprise, although a few items from the chart left me curious. Why did Gary Oldman get the worst sentiment of the whole batch? A look at the overall opinion about \u201cTinker Tailor Soldier Spy\u201d might explain it, which mirrors the fact that Meryl Streep\u2019s tweep love is middling. Disliked movies seems to drag down the star\u2019s own sentiment ratings.",

The man was picked up, without incident, at his home in Pennsylvania, at 4:30 a.m. on Thursday. He was taken to the barracks and detectives from New York City went there to meet with him, the official said. When asked if the man is the prime suspect in the case, Paul J. Browne, the Police Department\u2019s chief spokesman, said a man was being questioned in connection with the murder but declined to say if the man was a suspect in the case. Officials said that in the Tuesday killing, Dr. Faughey was clearly the target of the assailant \u2014 as she was viciously stabbed 15 times and Dr. Kent Shinbach, another doctor present, was not. On Wednesday investigators described the attack as a furious swirl of violence that unfolded after 8 p.m. in a suite of mental health offices at East 79th Street and York Avenue. A middle-aged man in a black cap and sneakers walked into the building, toting two pieces of black luggage. He said he was there to see a psychiatrist named Kent D. Shinbach. But Dr. Shinbach had another patient, a woman, waiting for him, so the man sat on a couch and made small talk. Then he disappeared into the office of the other doctor, Kathryn Faughey, the police said. The man stabbed Dr. Faughey in the head, face and chest. Hearing her screams, Dr. Shinbach rushed in and saw her lying still and bleeding on the floor by the foot of her desk. The attacker turned on him, stabbing him in the face, head and hands, the police said. Dr. Faughey, 56, was declared dead at the scene; Dr. Shinbach, who is in his 70s, survived, but was left in critical condition. Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said on Wednesday that after stabbing both doctors, the attacker pinned Dr. Shinbach against the wall with a spindled chair, took $90 from his wallet and fled to the building\u2019s basement and out a service exit. He left his two suitcases behind in the basement, where the police found a smear of blood on the door. The woman who had been waiting to see Dr. Shinbach had gone into his office at one point and was unharmed. During the attack on Dr. Shinbach, which lasted about 10 minutes, the attacker told him, \u201cShe\u2019s dead,\u201d the police said, adding that other comments he made did not shed light on his actions. Three knives were later found: one at Dr. Faughey\u2019s left foot; another, a 9-inch blade that was bent in the attack, underneath her desk; and a meat cleaver, also bent and with a broken handle, lying in front of a wall of books. Blood was splashed on the walls and floor. Investigators found that the larger suitcase, which had wheels and a handle, held women\u2019s slippers and a blouse, as well as disposable diapers for adults. Inside the smaller bag were eight knives \u2014 mostly kitchen knives \u2014 three lengths of rope and rolls of duct tape. Dr. Faughey, who grew up in Sunnyside, Queens, and lived across the street from her office, received a doctorate in clinical psychology from the Ferkauf Graduate School of Psychology at Yeshiva University in 1981. She had been practicing cognitive behavior psychotherapy on the Upper East Side for more than 20 years, according to her Web site. The attacker\u2019s entrance and departure were captured by security cameras. He arrived at the first-floor offices just after 8 p.m. He left at 8:59 p.m. through the basement door, on which investigators found blood. Investigators said the attacker might have cut his hand. It is common in such furious attacks, when blood can make the weapons slick. The police said DNA tests would be conducted to determine whose blood it was, but it was unclear how long the tests would take. In the videotape, the man\u2019s arrival is seen as a doorman holds a glass door open for him; he briskly walks in, stating that he was there to see Dr. Shinbach. Pulling his bags, he then goes up a short set of steps from the lobby to the professional offices. The videotape of the man leaving shows him from behind, as he rounds a corner in the basement and disappears out the exit, onto 79th Street between First and York Avenues. Reporting was contributed by John Eligon, Dmitry Kiper, Robin Stein, Stacey Stowe, Andrew Tangel and Carolyn Wilder.",

        "article": "Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth have long been playing it coy about their on-again, off-again relationship. Although it was rumored the pair has rekindled all the way back in January, it took until May for anything semi-official to pop up on their Instagram accounts, and it wasn\u2019t until July that they actually confirmed their relationship to the public. But this whole time, the pop star has been wearing a very suspicious diamond on her left hand ring finger \u2014 the same one she used to wear when the pair were engaged. But on Thursday\u2019s episode of The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Miley finally spoke about that particular piece of jewelry, confirming what we\u2019ve all long known to be true. This is the first time the singer has made an appearance on the morning talk show since she hosted an episode by herself while Ellen was out sick. In her interview, she spoke fondly of the experience, and discussed what it\u2019s been like campaigning for Hillary Clinton and how much she\u2019s loved being a judge on The Voice, a role she will be returning to for season 13. And she confirmed that the sparkler on her left hand that\u2019s been the source of much speculation is, in fact, an engagement ring. RELATED PHOTOS: The Most Jaw-Dropping Celebrity Engagement Rings DeGeneres broached the subject, asking, \u201cThere is a photo that got a lot of attention of your engagement ring. Are you wearing it right now?\u201d Cyrus confirmed the fact, and was congratulated by the host. Referring to her 3.5-carat cushion-cut, vintage-style Neil Lane diamond ring, Miley said, \u201cThis is really weird, because this is like real jewelry and most of my jewelry is made out of gummy bears and cotton candy \u2026 they don\u2019t look that good together because they kind of mix up. So sometimes I replace it with an actual unicorn or a Looney Tune. And [Hemsworth\u2019s] kind of like, What\u2019s going on? I am like, This isn\u2019t really my aesthetic, but I\u2019ll wear it because you love me.\u201d Ellen joked, \u201cHe could have saved a lot of money by giving you, like, a gummy bear ring.\u201d Hopefully, when these two do finally decide to tie the knot, Liam will learn from this mistake and just get Miley a Ring Pop instead of a pricey new wedding band. What do you think of Miley\u2019s engagement ring? Sound off below!",

        "article": "The Supreme Court could decide as soon as Thursday whether the federal government can require Americans to purchase private insurance coverage, a policy already in place in Massachusetts. Over the course of five years, insurance coverage in the state has increased, premiums have decreased and virtually everyone has abided by the new requirement. While public opinion is favorable - two-thirds of Massachusetts residents support the law - the state does face challenges ensuring that the law is affordable. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen in Massachusetts, and what the modeling has supported, is that we wouldn\u2019t really be where we are today without an insurance mandate,\u201d said Sarah Iselin, president of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Foundation of Massachusetts. \u201cYou can get closer to where we are, but you wouldn\u2019t be all the way there.\u201d Not all of that, however, has to do with the state\u2019s health care law: a report this year from the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation found that, in 2011, the law was responsible for an increase of just over 1 percent in state spending. The Massachusetts Legislature is now weighing legislation that would reduce the growth of health care costs. The state has long had one of the lowest rates of uninsured in the country. But in the mid-2000s, it was facing a big problem: Health coverage was becoming prohibitively expensive. The cost of an individual market plan spiked by 62 percent over two years, from $5,257 in 2005 to $8,537 in 2007. Premiums that year in New Jersey, the next most expensive state, were still more than $2,000 cheaper. Massachusetts has long tended to have higher health care costs than other areas of the country. But a series of changes passed in 1996 also contributed to the rising price of insurance premiums. The measures required insurance companies to accept all customers, regardless of any pre-existing conditions and limited how much sicker customers could be charged. The result: plans got more expensive and Massachusetts\u2019 uninsurance rate, which hovered around 7 percent in the early 1990s, crept up into double-digits. \u201cThe market really was limping along, not functioning at a level that anybody from a policy perspective would want it to,\u201d Iselin said. In 2003, Iselin\u2019s group convened local policymakers, business leaders and consumer advocates to discuss how the state could move to universal coverage. The plan they developed, \u201cRoadmap to Coverage,\u201d strongly resembled the universal coverage package that then-Gov. Mitt Romney signed in 2006. That package left Massachusetts\u2019 \u201cguaranteed issue\u201d provisions in place, meaning health plans would still need to accept all applicants. But it added two significant, elements: A requirement that everyone purchase health insurance and subsidies to guarantee that coverage was affordable. \u201cMassachusetts was a three-legged stool,\u201d said MIT health care economist Jonathan Gruber, who worked on both the Massachusetts and federal laws. \u201cFirst, you had the insurance reforms, already in place. It was clear to make that work, you needed a mandate. Then, if you\u2019re going to tell people they have to buy insurance, you have to make it affordable.\u201d The subsidies became available to all Massachusetts residents whose income was less than 150 percent of the federal poverty line in July 2007. When the subsidies became available, enrollment increased. Those who signed up before the mandate were 50 percent more likely to be chronically ill and had health care costs 45 percent higher than those who signed up after the mandate began. \u201cWe learned that the subsidies really were not enough to get the healthy people to sign up,\u201d said Harvard University\u2019s Amitabh Chandra, who has studied the Massachusetts law. \u201cYou really needed the mandate.\u201d The biggest jump in enrollment, however, was after the mandate took effect and more healthy individuals enrolled in coverage. Between 2006 and 2007, Massachusetts\u2019 uninsured rate dropped from 9.6 percent to 4.9 percent. It stood at 5.6 percent in 2010, the most recent year for which U.S. Census data is available. The cost of insurance, also due to a number of other insurance reforms, dropped dramatically, from $8,567 in 2006 to $5,143 the year after the Massachusetts law took effect. The fine for not carrying insurance wasn\u2019t especially big: for 2007, $219 in 2007. Paying that penalty would have been significantly less expensive than buying a plan. Still, most Bay State residents have opted for the latter, more expensive option. \u201cIf people in Massachusetts were economists, they would have said I\u2019m not going to comply,\u201d Chandra said. \u201cBut they aren\u2019t economists, and they hate the word penalty. I think Americans generally tend to be law-abiding people, and they hate the idea of not complying with a requirement.\u201d Massachusetts\u2019 penalty for not carrying coverage has increased over the years; in 2012, it could be as high as $1,206 for an individual. Compliance has tended to be very high. In 2010, the most recent year for which data is available, fewer than 1 percent percent of 6.6 million residents - approximately 44,000 people - were assessed a penalty for not carrying coverage. While Massachusetts\u2019 law has expanded coverage, it has not helped the state control health care costs. The governor\u2019s office projects health spending will eat up 41 percent of the state\u2019s budget by next year (in 2006, that number stood at 29 percent). Whether an individual mandate would be implemented as successfully nationally remains to be seen. Unlike the federal health overhaul, the Massachusetts law tended to have widespread support among business and community leaders. The individual mandate was the law\u2019s least-liked provision, but it still regularly received majority support from Bay State residents in public opinion polls. \u201cTechnically, can a mandate work? In Massachusetts, we learned, yes it can,\u201d said Harvard University\u2019s Robert Blendon, who has studied public opinion of the Massachusetts and federal laws. \u201cBut the answer about how it would play, in completely different political cultures, that could be completely different.\u201d Related: Health reform without a mandate: Lessons from Washington state",

        "article": "Young people are losing interest in motor vehicle and carmakers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sales are flagging across Europe. To solve these crippling dilemmas, car companies are scrambling to find new ways to reach the public, and many are looking beyond conventional motor shows to do so. Milan\u2019s annual Salone del Mobile, aka Milan Design Week, is one such avenue. Spread across the style-obsessive northern Italian metropolis, the event, with its focus on lighting, interior and graphic design, reaches further than the typical confines of any motor show. This year, nine international car brands were represented at the event. While some hired internationally recognised designers to create pieces for them, others chose to create designs in house. Only one carmaker, Renault, showed an actual concept car. \u201cMilan Design Week has grown in recent years from a furniture trade show into a world-class design exhibition,\u201d said Paul Van der Burgh, director of Lexus Europe. Van der Burgh cited the broad slate of industries, including automakers, which use the event \u201cto showcase their designs and communicate their brand messages.\u201d Here is a snapshot of automakers\u2019 activities in and around Milan. Toyota\u2019s luxury subsidiary centred its messaging around its L-Finesse design ethos, which was given abstract form through a web-like, ash wood and aluminium sculpture created in part by notable Japanese architect Toyo Ito. But the company also showed its support for up-and-coming designers through its first annual design competition. The 12 winners were announced at the Museo della Permanente, next to the large-scale sculpture. The French automaker stood out as the only brand to exhibit a concept car at the event. The Twin\u2019Z, which previewed the next-generation Twingo compact car, drew on specially commissioned product designer Ross Lovegrove\u2019s penchant for tactile materials and technology. It also fits within the ambitious, multi-vehicle \u201clife cycle\u201d series of concepts spearheaded by Renault\u2019s design director, Laurens van den Acker. Longstanding exhibitors in Milan, these corporate cousins betrayed no familial link in their displays. BMW commissioned French brothers Ronan and Erwan Bouroullec to design a carousel-like installation to highlight the sustainability of its i range, set to launch later this year. Mini\u2019s own team created a spatial concept titled Kapooow!, intended to draw attention to the new Paceman sports activity vehicle. For the first time, the Blue Oval occupied a stand at the event\u2019s main venue. \u201cWe are attending the Salone del Mobile showing products designed by automotive designers,\u201d said Erika Tsubaki, design supervisor for Ford of Europe. The carmaker\u2019s creatives stretched their multidisciplinary skills, using the brand\u2019s trapezoidal grille as a motif for a lamp and chair, while basing a watch\u2019s design on gauges in an instrument cluster. The DS Sofa, exhibited in a small room off Corso Roma, was a way to \u201caffirm the creativity of our designers by crossing into the world of furniture design,\u201d said the French company\u2019s design director, Thierry Metroz. The sofa did double conceptual duty: the shape of a shark's fin on the sofa\u2019s back and the interwoven leather of the seat were faithful to the resurrected DS model line, but the piece also paid homage to the iconic \u201cla chaise\u201d by mid-century minimalism titans Ray and Charles Eames. The Italian marquee collaborated with a Milanese furniture company to create the Lounge Chair by Zanotta, nominally inspired by the exterior of the redesigned Quattroporte sedan. The tufted leather and chrome-plated steel may not evoke the sports sedan in any direct way, but the lounge, which will be produced in a limited run at undisclosed pricing, handily delivers on shared brand values like \u201cstyle\u201d and \u201celegance\u201d, according to the chair\u2019s designers, Ludovica and Roberto Palomba. The pair has worked in the past for Maserati leather supplier Poltrona Frau. A light installation was the Korean automaker\u2019s way of showcasing its Fluidic Sculpture design language. Developed in collaboration with special effects company WhiteVoid, the installation used a 3D scanning system that registered body warmth and enabled visitors to interact with the 12,000 luminescent spheres to create curves and shapes. Head of design Ikuo Maeda has a fondness for Milan. Mazda\u2019s current Kodo design language was introduced in the city a few years ago, and this year the automaker opened a pop-up in the heart of Milan\u2019s fashion district. While the space\u2019s centrepiece was the new 6 sedan, the company also unveiled a Kodo-inspired one-off chair. \u201cThe car industry can be very predictable as to how it presents itself \u2013 motor shows, automobile magazines, etcetera,\u201d said Peter Birtwhistle, the carmaker\u2019s European director of design. \u201cAt Mazda we believe that we have to embrace a broader audience.\u201d",

        "article": "As host of the 2016 Olympic Games, Brazil is welcoming the entire world into its living room this month. But some 30 other nations also are throwing August open-house parties in Rio de Janeiro, hoping to lure tourists, sell exports, and wield diplomatic soft power. Sponsoring international houses during the Olympics has been a tradition for some countries since at least 1992. That\u2019s when the enterprising Dutch set up a tent in Barcelona Harbor to serve as a refuge for athletes, and a meet-and-great rendezvous for corporate sponsors, visiting foreign dignitaries and tourists at the Barcelona Games. The idea took off. During the 2012 Olympics, more than 50 national houses scattered around Greater London welcomed visitors. In Rio, national houses are proving popular with many Brazilians, many of whom lack the means to journey abroad. They\u2019re flocking to get their hands painted with henna, ogle tulips, frolic in a giant snow-globe and get a whiff of trade-wind fragrances. \u201cIt is an enriching experience, it is an opportunity to see a bit of each culture,\u201d said Brazilian dentist Patricia de Hollanda, 29, during a visit last Saturday to the Qatar national house, where she had her hands painted. De Hollanda, who\u2019d already been to the Swiss house, was also planning to stop by Germany\u2019s venue, among others. Some national houses allow anyone to walk in, while others are invitation-only or require an appointment. Some charge admission. Here are four worth dropping by. The Swiss house has the vibe of a stately European garden, as well as an amusement park, with an oversize snow globe, a 200-square-meter synthetic ice-skating rink, and a sprint track, all of which can be sampled for free. Picnicking areas, hammocks and decks also dot the 4,000-square-meter enclave on the banks of Rodrigo de Freitas lagoon. The compound, which opened August 1 and already has become popular with locals, comprises three separate domiciles and grounds. Entry is free, but food and drinks are not. Try the Marinated Caipirinha Salmon Wrap for 30 reais ($9.40), the Swiss style sausage (25 reais) or the traditional Swiss carrot cake (15 reais). There also are daily wine-tasting sessions. Swiss ambassador Nicolas Bideau said the Rio house complex is the largest his country ever has installed for an Olympics. \u201cBrazil doesn\u2019t understand small,\u201d he said. The Swiss government and sponsors, including watchmaker Omega and UBS bank, gave about $6 million to the project. The house also represents a marketing beachhead for Swiss products such the white wine Chasselas, which Switzerland is eager to sell in Brazil, Bideau said. Holland Heineken House is the Netherlands\u2019 13th consecutive Olympics hospitality suite. Located in a 100,000 square-foot sports club in the swanky Leblon neighborhood, it feels like a beach club during the day, with a jumbo poolside TV screen and free-flowing music and beer, and a night club once dusk falls, with Dutch bands and musicians whipping up the crowd. The house, which can pack in 4,000 people, often is filled to capacity despite its 158 reais (U.S. $54) entry fee, which doesn\u2019t include food or drinks. You can score a combo Brazilian beef burger and wash it down with a beer for 40 reais (about $12.50). Other embellishments include 15,000 imported orange tulips, a \u201ccelebration room\u201d for victorious Dutch athletes and a \u201ccry room\u201d where losing competitors can go for a cathartic sob and commiserate by phone with family and friends. Portugal\u2019s \u201chouse\u201d has an unusual feature: it floats. Actually, it\u2019s a historic ship, the Sagres, an elegant three-masted steel vessel whose trip to Rio was sponsored by the Portuguese Olympic Committee in partnership with the Portuguese Navy. Its westward voyage from Portugal tracked the path of Portuguese navigator Pedro Alvares Cabral, who came upon Brazil in 1500. With about 190 souls on board, the 89.5-meter ship cruised more than 40 days from Lisbon to Rio, with stops in Cape Verde, Recife and Salvador. The round trip will add up to 97 days, said Captain Ant\u00f3nio Manuel Gon\u00e7alves, and is being paid for by the Portuguese navy and 10 corporate sponsors. The Sagres was built in Hamburg in 1937 for the German Navy. After World War II, it was incorporated by the Brazilian Navy and, in 1961, bought by the Portuguese Navy to operate as a training ship. Docked at Rio\u2019s old port area, near Pra\u00e7a Mau\u00e1 on Guanabara Bay, Sagres is open to visitors every day during the Olympics; hours vary, so check the website for details. Entrance is free, but lines are long. Visitors soon will be able to have a taste of traditional Portuguese cuisine, such as the egg tart pastry called \u201cpastel de nata,\u201d for sale on shore. Qatar\u2019s house occupies a neo-classical 19th-century house and former museum in the Botafogo neighborhood. Advance reservations are needed, and the 20 reais ($6.30) entry fee goes to a Brazilian non-profit organization dedicated to promoting athletics in public schools. Visitors gain access to a replica Qatari market, where, in addition to henna hand-painting, they can snap selfies dressed in authentic clothing, watch sword-dancing shows, use interactive touch-screens to learn about Qatari history and culture, and take part in coffee and tea workshops. The food, overseen by Brazilian celebrity chef Alex Atala, is included in the price. Adding more Arabian flavor, aromatic herbs suffuse the house, enveloping visitors as they shuffle past imported Qatari carpets, dazzling fabrics, and other exotic wares. Qatar, which is hosting the 2022 World Cup and dreams of getting the 2028 Olympic Games, is mounting a charm offensive to woo global tourists. \u201cBrazilians are very curious, they love to experience and try different things,\u201d said Asma Al Thani, Communications and Marketing Director for the Qatar Olympic Committee. So how do you say \u201cMinha casa \u00e9 a sua casa\u201d in Arabic? Write to Luciana Magalhaes at Luciana.Magalhaes@dowjones.com and Reed Johnson at Reed.Johnson@wsj.com",

That was the game, and I played it well. This landed me great grades, high class rankings, good job offers, and a passionate disdain for reading and learning. In fact, I can\u2019t remember reading a single book between ages 16 and 25 that wasn\u2019t coerced. I once heard someone glowingly comment about a \u201cgreat book\u201d he was reading, and it baffled me. How could anyone enjoy something so mundane? The transition from school to entrepreneurship was jarring, to put it nicely. Previously, the path to success had been reading what I was assigned, having the teacher explain its importance, and regurgitating the teacher\u2019s opinion. The game had changed. No one was there to explain the rules, assign me reading, or test me on their opinion. What mattered was someone paying for value created. How could I create value? How had others created value? How is a logo created? What is this payroll tax thing? I had lots of questions, and my first inclination was to do what school taught me. I found \u201cexperts\u201d and asked them for help. Without exception, the advice I got was terrible. It turns out finding real experts isn\u2019t easy. My only other option was to do something I absolutely hated: read. To my surprise, reading was awesome. The smartest people in the world were sharing their secrets, demonstrating their logic, and explaining how the world worked. After a short adjustment period, I began reading approximately two hours per day and came to consider it the most valuable part of my life. After five years of exploration, here\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned about reading: Get Recommendations: The shortest path to awesome content is through a referral from someone you respect. His or her endorsement means far more than any book critic\u2019s. A few people who do a great job of recommending books are Brad Feld and Ben Casnocha. Find Curators: Avid readers usually love to curate content. This primarily happens on Twitter or blogs. Because I follow so many curators and struggle with getting their top content, I helped create a Twitter tool called Brook that sends top updates daily via email. A few of my favorites are Tim O\u2019Reilly, Eric Ries, Mark Suster, Rand Fishkin, Fred Wilson, Steve Blank, Peter Attia, and Dave Asprey. Follow Mentions: Once you find a core group of influencers to follow in your areas of interest, watch closely who they mention and reference. This is the best way to find new influencers. Prioritize: Don\u2019t invent excuses not to read. Make it a priority and stick with it. Set a time of day that will be uninterrupted, whether that\u2019s early morning or your lunch hour. Adjust to Your Mood: Sometimes, I like a series of quick blog posts, while other times, I enjoy deeply immersing myself in a long, challenging book. Have a good selection of material available and let your mood determine the path. Take Notes: I\u2019ve come to view reading as an opportunity for conversation with the author, and notes are my feedback. Get a pen out, or use the notes function on your iPad, and consistently react to what you\u2019re reading. It will allow you to engage more deeply and think more critically. Stop and Dream: Much of what we call innovation is merely the reorganization of seemingly unrelated puzzle pieces. Reading will consistently throw new puzzle pieces in front of you. Take the time to stop, dream, and reorganize them. Give Up Easily: If you\u2019re not enjoying it, stop reading it. With all the amazing books in existence, your opportunity costs are extremely high. Don\u2019t Be Goal-Driven: We all like to feel useful, and an easy way to do that is to focus on the number of books read. But like being \u201cbusy\u201d at work, it just doesn\u2019t matter. Instead of the quantity, focus on the quality of thought and personal growth you attain. Take Risks: There\u2019s a temptation to read the flavor of the day. Another pattern is reading on topics you know well. In both situations, take risks. Read outside your comfort zone. Be Critical: The point of writing a non-fiction book is to make a point or illuminate a previously misunderstood topic. Yet not all observations, research, or logic are created equal. Just because an author says it doesn\u2019t make it correct. Be critical and thoughtful, even of the most well-known authors. Ping the Author: Authors are people, too, and they enjoy feedback. Find them on Twitter or contact them through their websites to ask a few of your most challenging questions. Most won\u2019t respond, but a good percentage will. I\u2019ve developed some great relationships this way. Find a Reading Buddy: Like most things in life, reading is more enjoyable, enriching, and valuable if it\u2019s shared. Find someone with whom you can be transparent and read in parallel. You\u2019ll be amazed at how much more you can gain by processing out loud. For all you readers out there, what did I miss? What tips do you have? I\u2019d love to hear them below or on Twitter. Author: Brent Beshore | Google+ |@brentbeshore | LinkedIn",

        "article": "A director who allegedly tipped off an accused insider trading kingpin knew full well that the tips breached his duty to investors, Lloyd Blankfein said. Blankfein, the Goldman Sachs GS CEO, testified for the prosecution Wednesday morning in the government\u2019s case against trader Raj Rajaratnam. The U.S. attorney is trying to put the founder of the Galleon hedge fund behind bars for 20 years, saying he made off with $45 million via illegal insider trades on stocks including Goldman and Procter & Gamble pg . Fortune\u2019s Katie Benner is at the trial in Lower Manhattan. Here is her dispatch: Blankfein said Rajat Gupta, the former Goldman board member accused of passing along $17 million worth of trading tips to Rajaratnam, knew he owed Goldman shareholders a fiduciary duty to keep a lid on developments in Goldman board meetings \u2013 but breathlessly called Rajaratnam on repeated occasions to fill him in anyway. The testimony is important because the judge in the case, U.S. District Court Judge Richard Holwell, has ruled that prosecutors must show Rajaratnam\u2019s alleged tippers not only fed him confidential information, but knew that doing so was illegal. The Securities and Exchange Commission claimed in a civil complaint filed against Gupta this month that Gupta repeatedly called Rajaratnam just after getting off the phone from several Goldman board meetings during the financial crisis. Gupta has denied wrongdoing and then some. The most celebrated instance relates to a Sept. 23, 2008, board meeting at which the Goldman board approved a $5 billion infusion from Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway brk.a . Blankfein testified he and Gupta were on that call. The SEC says that three minutes after that call ended, Gupta called Rajaratnam \u2013 whose funds promptly bought 175,000 Goldman shares. Gupta and Rajatnam knew the development would be good for Goldman shares \u2014 as would a decision to raise money by selling stock to the public, Blankfein said. The testimony by Blankfein, the highly compensated chief of one of the world\u2019s most controversial banks, has been eagerly awaited since his probable appearance at the biggest insider trading trial in a generation was announced earlier this month. Blankfein may have won over some skeptical jurors with his straightforward, easy-to-follow explanation of what Goldman does and what the firm expects of its directors. He may even have prompted a smile or two with his sheepish reading of the press release announcing the Berkshire deal, which among other things obliged him to repeat the line, \u201csaid Lloyd C. Blankfein, chairman and CEO of the Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\u201d But Blankfein didn\u2019t let his guard down, continuing to insist in the face of all available evidence that Goldman was never at risk of failure. \u201cNo matter how safe we were, it makes us that much safer,\u201d he said of the twin capital raises.

What job allows him to do that the easiest? Department of sanitation head? Nope. Homeland security. Closed doors, no cameras. We gotta shut off all the mics in the room. It's just gonna be us. This is very serious.\" Reporter: Joking aside, this is actually a very sad story about a man who, because of his religious beliefs and fervent ambition, chose to live a gigantic lie. AS jim McGreevey told oprah -- I couldn't achieve anything that I wanted professionally if people knew that I was gay. I could never be a mayor. I could never be an elected governor. Reporter: Really? His real mistake was appointing this good looking sailer was homeland security chief. The first time in my life i kissed a man sent me through the roof. Reporter: Fine but you can't give a pivotal job to a guy who was totally unqualified and now claims there was no con sen wall relationship, who was threatening an aharassment suit which led to his coming out press conference.

I climbed on top of her to make sure that she was safe. How do you lie to your wife with that accent? That's amazing. Reporter: Maria and the housekeeper were pregnant at the same time. They gave birth within days of each other. The affair was draum tiesed by kathy griffin. Theirs was a forbidden love. I want to rafish you. I want to see the lef tags of the room.

        "article": "WASHINGTON, Nov. 19\u2014 House-Senate conferees on a new farm bill decided today to adjust food stamp benefits for inflation at an earlier date next year. The Agriculture Department said the step could save $700 million in the fiscal year 1982 because the rate of inflation was expected to be lower at that time. In return for House acceptance of this change, the Senate's conferees agreed to raise the the total amount available for food stamps to $11.7 billion, from a $10.87 billion limit imposed in a separate Senate measure on food stamps. The conference, now in its third difficult week, broke another deadlock by accepting a watered-down Senate version of a farm bill clause intended to tighten inspection standards on imported meat. The conferees did this despite warnings from the House Agriculture Committee chairman, E. (Kika) de la Garza, Democrat of Texas, that this version was not present in the meat inspection clauses of either the House- or Senate-approved farm bills. He said that this would subject the conference report to a floor challenge when it is returned for final approval by both bodies. Floor Challenge Promised Representative Glenn English, Democrat of Oklahoma, whose more stringent meat inspection clause was rejected, said afterward that he would probably challenge any conference bill that included the clause adopted today. ''I intend, as of now, to work against the conference report we now have,'' he said. ''It's not in any way what the farmers of this country want.'' In the original food stamp section of the House farm bill adopted last month, the date for adjusting food stamp benefits for inflation was to be June 30, 1982, with whatever changes this required to be paid after Oct. 1. The conferees today accepted a motion by Representative E. Thomas Coleman, Republican of Missouri, to make the adjustment on April 30, 1982, when presumably the inflation rise would not be as high as later in the year and thus the increase in food stamp benefits would not be as great. The April 30 adjustment, which also would not actually be paid until after Oct. 1, was expected to reduce food stamp costs by about $700 million. This saving would be effective in the fiscal year starting next October. By raising the spending limit on food stamps in this fiscal year to $11.7 billion, the conferees intended to insure the same rate of benefits through Sept. 30 even though rising unemployment was expected to increase the number of families on the food stamp rolls. If the cap had not been raised, as these numbers increased, the levels of benefits would have had to be reduced. The rescheduling of the adjustment date was done in the absence of Representative Frederick W. Richmond, Democrat of Brooklyn, who has been the chief architect of food stamp legislation in the House. However, Mr. Coleman said the change had been approved last night by Mr. Richmond. The question of new meat inspection requirements has been bedeviling the conferees for more than a week. Opponents of both the English measure and the one originally introduced in the Senate by Senator John Melcher, Democrat of Montana, charged that they would result in blocking most meat imports into this country. Both measures would have banned any foreign meat or meat products from animals treated with chemicals that are banned for use in the United States.",

        "article": "An unreleased draft of the U.N.\u2019s next major climate report reportedly states that scientists are more certain than ever that man\u2019s actions are warming the planet -- even as the report struggles to explain a slow-down in warming that climate skeptics have seized upon. Global surface temperatures rose rapidly during the 70s, but have been relatively flat over the past decade and a half, according to data from the U.K.\u2019s weather-watching Met Office. Climate skeptics have spent months debating the weather pattern, some citing it as evidence that global warming itself has decelerated or even stopped. A draft of the upcoming AR5 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which is set for final release in Oct. 2014 and used by governments around the world, offers a variety of explanations for the decline, Reuters reported, from ocean storage of heat to volcanoes. \u201cScientists believe causes could include: greater-than-expected quantities of ash from volcanoes, which dims sunlight; a decline in heat from the sun during a current 11-year solar cycle; more heat being absorbed by the deep oceans; or the possibility that the climate may be less sensitive than expected to a build-up of carbon dioxide,\u201d explained Reuters. The draft expresses \u201cmedium confidence\u201d that the slowing in global warming \"due in roughly equal measure\" to those factors, Reuters said. \"It might be down to minor contributions that all add up,\" said Gabriele Hegerl, a professor at Edinburgh University told the news agency. Or maybe the latest decade is simply a statistical blip, an anomaly in a larger trend. Climate bloggers were quick to dismiss all of the possible explanations for the slow down in warming. \"All of these fatuous figures are pulled out of the air to support the IPCC ideologies and not based upon any statistical analysis or science,\" wrote Marc Morano, a particularly outspoken climate skeptic who writes the popular blog Climate Depot. The U.N. arm responsible for the report released a statement to FoxNews.com on Monday stating that it was premature to draw conclusions from the leaked draft. \u201cThe text is likely to change in response to comments from governments received in recent weeks and will also be considered by governments and scientists at a four-day approval session at the end of September,\u201d the statement said. \u201cIt is therefore premature and could be misleading to attempt to draw conclusions from it.\u201d The report stresses that scientists are now 95 percent certain that man\u2019s actions are responsible for global warming, and that action is key to avert a coming crises. \u201cThe report is simply an exclamation mark on what we already knew: Climate change is real and it continues unabated, the primary cause is fossil fuel burning, and if we don\u2019t do something to reduce carbon emissions we can expect far more dangerous and potentially irreversible impacts on us,\u201d climate scientist Michael Mann wrote to Climate Progress. The U.N. agency's report is sure to face intense scrutiny. The 2007 iteration was widely lambasted over flaws and sloppy information, notably the claim that global warming would cause the Himalayas to melt by 2035.",

        "article": "Judy Lewis, a psychotherapist and former actress who wrote a book about her complicated heritage as the illegitimate daughter of Hollywood legends , has died. She was 76. A longtime resident of Los Angeles, Lewis died of Friday in Gladwyne, Pa., according to her daughter, Maria Tinney Dagit. Brought up in Bel-Air as Young's adopted daughter, Lewis was an adult when she learned that the glamorous leading lady and Gable, the dashing star of \" had conceived her during a brief affair in the 1930s. Fearful of scandal, Young hid the pregnancy and later fabricated the adoption. Gable never acknowledged that Lewis was his daughter, although he visited her once when she was 15, an experience that Lewis tenderly recounted in her 1994 memoir, Young was single and 22 and Gable married and 34 when they co-starred in (1935), based on the classic novel by Jack London. The rest of their story unfolds like a B movie: The unmarried, devout Catholic known for playing wholesome roles discovers she is pregnant as she is set to star in legendary director Cecil B. DeMille's religious-themed film \"The Crusades,\" goes abroad to avoid gossip, and returns to Los Angeles to give birth in secrecy. Then she turns the infant over to a home run by nuns, retrieves her daughter before she turns 2, fakes the adoption and raises the child under a cloud of lies. \"I had to write this book,\" Lewis told The Times in 1994 when her memoir was released. \"I don't think anyone knows what it's like not to be acknowledged by your own parents.\" She was born on Nov. 6, 1935, in a little house in Venice, where Young hid during the last weeks of the pregnancy. Lewis spent the first months of her life there. According to her memoir, Gable visited her there and was so appalled to find her sleeping in a drawer that he took $400 out of his pocket and told Young to \"buy her a decent bed.\" When she was eight months old, Young placed her in a Catholic orphanage in San Francisco, retrieving her when she was 19 months old. Her \"adoption\" was leaked to Hollywood columnist When she was 5, her mother married radio producer Tom Lewis and had two sons with him. Although she had his last name, he never adopted her and treated her poorly. Young apparently never told him that Gable was her daughter's father, but it was an open secret in Hollywood \u2014 one that, amazingly, never reached young Judy's ears because all her friends had been instructed not to tell her. The physical hints, however, were difficult to ignore. Lewis had Gable's broad smile and his famously prominent ears. She hid her ears under bonnets until she was 7, when she underwent surgery to pin them back. One day in 1950 Lewis came home from Marymount Girls Catholic School to find the screen idol standing in her front hallway. \"I couldn't believe my eyes,\" she wrote in her memoir. \"He was right in front of me, and he was smiling at me. His eyes were crinkled into smile lines at the corners and he was so tall that I had to look up. He was much more handsome than I remembered him from the movies.\u2026 What is he doing here? I wondered to myself. But I could say nothing. I was speechless.\" She tried to escape upstairs to prepare for a dinner date, but her mother commanded her to stay. Over the next hour, Gable sat beside her on the sofa and engaged her in earnest conversation about herself. Before he left, he thanked her for a lovely visit. Then, she recalled, he \"bent down and, cupping my face in his two big hands, kissed me lightly on the forehead.\" She never saw him again. Not until several years later did she begin to grasp the meaning of the mysterious visit. Two weeks before her wedding, she panicked and told her fiance, Joe Tinney, she could not marry him because \"I don't know who I am.\" She said he told her, \"Judy, don't worry about it. I know everything about you. You're Clark Gable's daughter.\" She was astounded. It took her eight years, when she was 31 and appearing in the soap opera \"The Secret Storm,\" to confront her mother. Young, after throwing up in the bathroom, told her that Gable indeed was her father. Then she made Lewis promise to tell no one. In the 1980s, after a two-decade acting career that included appearances on Broadway and dozens of television shows, Lewis became a marriage and family therapist, working with foster children and pregnant teens. Her marriage to Tinney ended in divorce in 1972. In addition to her daughter, she is survived by two grandsons and three half-brothers, including , who was born after his famous father died of a while filming \"The Misfits\" in 1960. When Lewis' book came out, her mother publicly denied Gable's paternity. Estranged for years, the two women reconciled shortly before . Young's silence about the affair with Gable was not broken until a few months after her death in \"Forever Young,\" an authorized biography by Joan Wester Anderson. Lewis never had a chance to ask Gable the questions that swirled in her head for years: Did he want a child? What was he thinking that day they met? Would he have wanted to help raise her if her mother hadn't pushed him away? She said that whenever she watched Gable's loving scenes with his on-screen daughter in \"Gone With the Wind,\" she cried. \"It's very sad to me,\" she told the London Telegraph in 2002, \"because he's so dear with her. I pretend it's me.\"",

        "article": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama tried to mend fences with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany on Friday, calling her \u201cone of my closest friends on the world stage.\u201d But Ms. Merkel replied tartly that Germany still had significant differences with the United States over surveillance practices and that it was too soon to return to \u201cbusiness as usual.\u201d The cordial but slightly strained encounter, which played out as the two leaders stood next to each other at a Rose Garden news conference, attested to the lingering scars left by the sensational disclosure last October that the National Security Agency had eavesdropped on Ms. Merkel\u2019s phone calls. It came as the two leaders sought to project a unified front against Russia\u2019s aggression in Ukraine, threatening President Vladimir V. Putin with sweeping new sanctions if Russia disrupted elections in Ukraine later this month, even as they acknowledged that not all European countries were ready to sign on to the most punishing measures. Ms. Merkel, who last fall declared that \u201cspying between friends is simply unacceptable\u201d and that the United States had opened a breach of trust that would have to be repaired, said at the news conference that \u201cwe have a few difficulties yet to overcome.\u201d One remaining issue, she said, was the \u201cproportionality\u201d of the surveillance. The president and the visiting Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany delivered remarks on finding a diplomatic solution to the crisis in Ukraine. Credit By AP on Publish Date May 2, 2014 Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times Mr. Obama, pointing to his administration\u2019s efforts to restore privacy safeguards, even for non-Americans, said, \u201cWe have gone a long way in closing some of the gaps, but as Chancellor Merkel said, there are some gaps that need to be worked through.\u201d Nearly a year after the first disclosures about the N.S.A.\u2019s practices at home and abroad, however, the agency is emerging with a mandate to make only modest changes: some new limits on what kind of data it can hold about Americans, and stricter White House oversight of decisions to tap the cellphones of foreign leaders. The Obama administration is now turning its attention to Silicon Valley \u2014 the subject of a major White House study released Thursday \u2014 and whether the government should intervene to protect and prevent discriminatory behavior. \u201cThese are complicated issues,\u201d Mr. Obama said of the debate over surveillance and civil liberties, as he glanced over at Ms. Merkel. \u201cWe\u2019re not perfectly aligned yet, but we share the same values, and we share the same concerns.\u201d The depth of their differences, however, was reflected by the failure to reach a broader intelligence-sharing agreement between the United States and Germany. The two sides could not even agree on how the talks had begun, with Mr. Obama disputing that the United States had ever offered Germany a so-called no-spy agreement. \u201cWe do not have a blanket no-spy agreement with any country,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cwe\u2019re not holding back from doing something with Germany that we somehow do with somebody else.\u201d Months of negotiations to reach an agreement ended unsuccessfully after the two sides could not agree on its scope. According to administration officials, the Germans insisted that the United States not conduct any unsanctioned espionage on German soil, including from its embassy in Berlin, something it has not agreed to with other allies. Ms. Merkel did not address the negotiations directly, but said the debate showed the need for further dialogue between the United States and Germany, not just at the level of governments but also between lawmakers and the German and American people. Even as she highlighted differences with the White House, Ms. Merkel\u2019s government advised against inviting Edward J. Snowden, the renegade former N.S.A. contractor who leaked the information about its surveillance practices, to testify before the German Parliament. A report by a German ministry on Friday said Mr. Snowden\u2019s appearance would cause further damage to the relationship between the United States and Germany. The German officials had solicited an opinion from a Washington law firm suggesting that American authorities could seek to charge members of Parliament for complicity in Mr. Snowden\u2019s publicizing of classified information. Still, for two leaders who had bonded over thorny issues like the European financial crisis, the N.S.A. furor has taken an obvious toll. Ms. Merkel deflected a question about whether the personal trust between her and Mr. Obama had been restored. When Ms. Merkel was asked if she was satisfied with how the White House had responded, Mr. Obama jumped in to answer first, saying he knew how emotional the issue was in Germany. \u201cAngela Merkel is one of my closest friends on the world stage, somebody whose partnership I deeply value,\u201d the president said. \u201cIt has pained me to see the degree to which the Snowden disclosures have created strains in the relationship.\u201d In their private meetings on Friday, an American official said, the chemistry between Ms. Merkel and Mr. Obama was still good. They spent most of their time talking about the crisis in Ukraine, where they have emerged as the two leaders marshaling the Western response. Both kept up the pressure on Mr. Putin over Ukraine, setting a new trigger for much broader sanctions against Russian industry. Ms. Merkel noted that these measures would be imposed if Russia disrupted an election in Ukraine planned for May 25. \u201cShould that not be possible to stabilize the situation further, further sanctions will be unavoidable,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is something that we don\u2019t want.\u201d Mr. Obama was even more emphatic, saying, \u201cThe Russian leadership must know that if it continues to destabilize eastern Ukraine and disrupt this month\u2019s presidential election, we will move quickly on additional steps, including further sanctions that will impose greater costs.\u201d While administration officials say Germany and the United States have been united in their response, the Germans have balked at sweeping sanctions on the Russian energy industry because that could reverberate on their fossil fuel-dependent economy. Building European support for industrywide sanctions will be a challenge, Mr. Obama said, because \u201cyou\u2019ve got 28 countries, and some are more vulnerable than others to potential Russian retaliation. And we have to take those into account. Not every country is in the same place.\u201d Some experts on Germany said the Ukraine crisis could give Mr. Obama and Ms. Merkel the foundation to rebuild their relationship, reminding them that despite the suspicion generated by the surveillance disclosures, their countries still have much in common. \u201cDespite their enormous differences in background and style, Merkel and Obama share a similar approach to crises \u2014 they react cautiously, slowly, and incrementally,\u201d said Jackson Janes, the president of the American Institute for Contemporary German Studies at Johns Hopkins University. \u201cThat instinct has been on display again in recent months.\u201d David E. Sanger contributed reporting. A version of this article appears in print on May 3, 2014, on page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Merkel Signals Tension Persists Over U.S. Spying.

        "article": "INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 An Indiana county at the heart of an H.I.V. outbreak has seen a \u201csignificant increase\u201d in the number of cases more than two weeks into a short-term needle exchange program, state health officials said. There are now 120 confirmed H.I.V. cases and 10 preliminary positive cases tied to Scott County, the Indiana State Department of Health said on Friday. That is up from 106 the previous week. Health officials who declared an epidemic last month have said that they expect the number of cases to rise as more people are tested. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sent staff members to Indiana last month to help with testing, the Health Department said in a news release. The growing number of cases could put pressure on Gov. Mike Pence to extend the 30-day needle exchange program that he approved on March 26. A spokeswoman for the governor, Kara Brooks, said on Friday that Mr. Pence was reviewing reports and recommendations from health officials and would decide within the next few days whether to extend the program beyond April 25. The Scott County outbreak has occurred among intravenous drug users and primarily involves the use of the high-powered painkiller Opana, health officials have said. The county usually sees about five H.I.V. cases a year. Since Mr. Pence approved the temporary exchange, 5,322 clean syringes have been provided to 86 participants, health officials said Friday. About 1,400 used syringes have been returned. Brittany Combs, a public health nurse for the Scott County Health Department, said the needle exchange program picked up a lot last week, in large part because a mobile unit has been traveling around neighborhoods seeking to get more intravenous drug users into the program. \u201cYou have to gain that trust, and I think we\u2019re slowly starting to do that,\u201d Ms. Combs said. But the future of the Scott County program, as well as the fate of legislation that would allow needle exchange programs in other counties, is not clear. Mr. Pence, a Republican, opposes needle exchanges as an antidrug policy. David Long, the State Senate\u2019s president pro tem, said Thursday that the emergency exchange for Scott County was \u201cthe right reaction\u201d but added that he was not sure if it was the correct long-term approach. Nor was he sure, he said, whether the Senate would support legislation sponsored by the chairman of the House Public Health Committee, Representative Ed Clere, that would allow the 23 Indiana counties with the highest rates of hepatitis C to establish their own needle exchange programs. Health officials say that high rates of hepatitis C are an indicator of needle-sharing. The House approved the bill on April 7 in a 54-to-39 vote. The measure is scheduled for a hearing on Monday in a House-Senate conference committee, which will try to work out a final version for lawmakers to consider before the legislature\u2019s April 29 adjournment deadline. Mr. Long said the governor was not alone in his concerns that needle exchanges could promote instead of prevent drug use. \u201cAt the same time, you adapt and you evolve based on the world we live in, so we\u2019re going to have to see if that requires a pivot for us,\u201d he added. Mr. Clere said he appreciated the governor\u2019s approval of the needle exchange, but he added: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t help in other areas of the state that are at risk for a similar outbreak. It\u2019s just not enough.\u201d He said the association between needle exchanges and illegal drug activity made many people, including lawmakers, uncomfortable. But he said the exchange program should be viewed as \u201ca proven and effective harm-reduction policy,\u201d not as an antidrug policy. \u201cWe simply can\u2019t afford to view this as a short-term problem,\u201d Mr. Clere said. Money could also be an issue as lawmakers weigh their options. Since 1989, the federal government has banned public financing of needle exchange programs. Mr. Pence\u2019s executive order did not include money for the Scott County program. \u201cThey asked the state agencies to find their own money. How sustainable is that?\u201d asked Beth Meyerson, a director of the Rural Center for AIDS/S.T.D. Prevention at Indiana University.

        "article": "As a test of the \"tea party\" movement's ability to galvanize voters for a single chosen candidate, Utah's GOP Senate primary Tuesday is likely to deliver a mixed message. Republicans Tim Bridgewater and Mike Lee survived a bruising convention in May that knocked out incumbent Sen. Robert F. Bennett and gave the tea party and other conservative groups bragging rights as a dragon-slayer. Now, most of those groups -- but not all of them -- have rallied around Lee, a 38-year-old lawyer. But Bridgewater, 49, is even or ahead in several polls. That underscores the tea party's challenge: converting the energy of its members into a well-organized electoral effort. \"There is some division in the overall tea party movement, but we said, look, 'Mike's clearly the best guy,' so we decided to roll the dice and work really hard,\" said Brendan Steinhauser, a spokesman for the national tea party organizer FreedomWorks. \"I think we made a really big impact no matter what, win or lose.\" FreedomWorks and Tea Party Express both endorsed Lee, as did former presidential contender Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas) and South Carolina Sen. Jim DeMint. In addition, FreedomWorks launched one of its biggest grass-roots mobilizing efforts to date. By the end of Tuesday, Steinhauser said his volunteers will have contacted one-third of the 100,000 Republican primary voters expected to cast ballots. If that proves not to be enough, there are a number of possible reasons why. First, the leader of the Utah Tea Party, David Kirkham, endorsed Bridgewater, a businessman who, like Lee, has campaigned as a conservative, tea-party-friendly candidate. In fact, the main difference between the two candidates, according to Steinhauser, is that Bridgewater supported an expansion of Medicare prescription drug coverage as well as former president George W. Bush's school accountability initiative, No Child Left Behind. Both candidates support repealing health-care reform, both advocate for increasing border security and both promise to reduce entitlement programs, earmark spending and taxes in general. (In addition, both graduated from Brigham Young University). Another factor is that the fiscally conservative Club for Growth, which deserves much of the credit for taking out Bennett with a relentless TV campaign targeting his vote for the financial bailout, has stayed out of the primary altogether. And yet another is the fact that Bennett, although not popular among the state's hard-core conservatives, endorsed Bridgewater -- a fact that could help him among the more moderate Republicans who vote in Tuesday's primary. \"Both of them are really quite sympathetic to the tea party movement,\" said Dave Hansen, chairman of the state Republican Party -- and that's good news for the movement, he said, in a state where winning the Republican nomination is tantamount to winning the election. Hansen, who has stayed out of the race publicly, said the result will depend, like so many races, on turnout. Low turnout will help Lee, he said, while higher turnout will draw out a broader spectrum of Republicans, including Bennett loyalists more likely to vote for Bridgewater. \"I have to admit I've really gone back and forth on this one,\" Hansen said. \"I really have no idea who's going to win.\"",

        "article": "Seated across the table, Nick Weaver wields what appears to be a patch of white porcelain. It\u2019s slightly bulbous, a palm-sized square with rounded edges. Save for a stylized Scandinavian name printed in the lower left-hand corner\u2014\u201deero\u201d\u2014one might mistake it for a slab cut from a toilet. In fact, Weaver is unveiling the product of a year\u2019s worth of stealth research and development undertaken by Eero, his 15-person San Francisco-based startup. The unassuming plastic chunk encloses an all-in-one Wi-Fi device: a wireless router, access point, and range extender all rolled into one. He places it gingerly on the tabletop. What makes Eero\u2019s product different from those already marketed by competitors such as Linksys or Belkin (which acquired Linksys in 2013) is that the devices don\u2019t, according to Weaver, require add-ons (although you\u2019ll need three to cover a typical household). Eero works in tandem to create a wireless mesh network that permeates your home with Internet access. The devices run diagnostics, automatically download security fixes, and send weekly digests about network activity, Weaver says. Should anything go wrong\u2014which is unlikely, he assures\u2014there\u2019s no need to get up and hit \u201crestart.\u201d The device will reboot itself. Set-up is easy, too: Just plug the first one into your cable or DSL modem and a power source, spread the rest around your living quarters (also near power outlets), and the network can be managed with a mobile application. Weaver pulls out his phone to show me the status of his in-laws\u2019 home Wi-Fi network back on the West Coast. (Eero has been beta-testing its eponymous devices in 25 San Francisco homes, including Weaver\u2019s own.) At the tap of a screen, he monitors its activity from Fortune\u2018s offices on the opposite side of the United States. It\u2019s the only home Wi-Fi system you\u2019ll ever need, he\u2019s fond of saying. The devices are meant to address some of the pain points that afflict home Wi-Fi: dead zones, password management, and yes, that dreaded, stomach-knotting epitaph of many an attempted video stream: \u201cBuffering.\u201d Eliminating dead zones is a cinch, Weaver says, since the system is distributed. Each device covers about 1,000 square feet, and three usually do the trick, he says, turning the Eero over in his hands. The presence of multiple nodes helps prevent the network from overloading. As more devices connect and as they stream more data, the distributed Eero system keeps any one device from becoming too saturated. (In addition to targeting Internet of Things early adopters, the company hopes to court so-called cord-cutters, people who have ditched cable plans in favor of video streaming services like Netflix and Hulu.) The Eero device also makes password management simple. People joining the network are split into three groups: \u201cowners,\u201d \u201cusers,\u201d and \u201cguests.\u201d Owners have full administrative rights, users can invite guests, and guests solely can access the network. (For slightly more granular control, there is the option to set time limits for network access.) Also, instead of trying to decipher the alphanumeric character hastily jotted down by the installation technician\u2014Seriously, is that a capital \u201cY\u201d or \u201c4\u201d or some kind of Sumerian logograph?\u2014users can simply be added through the accompanying Eero app. For anyone who wants to join the network who doesn\u2019t have the app, an owner can easily text them the password. \u201cI grew up setting up these networks in Chicago,\u201d Weaver says, reminiscing about a job he had around his neighborhood as a boy. Later at Stanford University, he took the reins again as a network administrator. That\u2019s where he met his company\u2019s co-founders, Amos Schallich and Nate Hardison. Last January, the startup raised $4 million in funding from First Round Capital, Menlo Ventures (Weaver\u2019s former firm), Stanford-affiliated StartX, AME Cloud Ventures, Homebrew Ventures, and individuals like Alexis Ohanian, Gary Tan, and Trae Vassallo. Today the company leaves \u201cstealth mode\u201d with plans to sell each device for $125 (or $300 for a 3-pack) and ship them in early summer. \u201cWe spent a lot of time on the software piece, adding intelligence to the network,\u201d Weaver says. His team spent an equal amount of time on the design. They wanted to create an item\u2014a piece of industrial art\u2014people would be proud to have on display. To make the devices beautiful, the startup enlisted one of today\u2019s top design minds, Fred Bould, whose projects include the GoPro Hero 3 and the Nest thermostat. Eero\u2019s design is more than just for show. There is a commercial interest in looking pretty. When consumers prominently display the devices in their homes, they can potentially get better performance out of them. Further, the company hopes to tap into that social phenomenon\u2014the network effect\u2014that helps new products catch on. In a perfect scenario, people see Eero devices at their friend\u2019s and family\u2019s places, want them, and go out and buy them, too. Since most Wi-Fi devices get buried, hidden from view, or stashed in closets\u2014there is an \u201caesthetic hurdle you have to mount,\u201d Weaver says, passing the tile in my direction. The company and product\u2019s name is a reference to Eero Saarinen, designer of St. Louis\u2019 signature Gateway Arch and master of sweeping architectural forms. (He also designed the Bell Labs headquarters.) Inspecting the slab, I still think it\u2019s unlikely that people will start decorating their domiciles with routers\u2014even Eero\u2019s charmingly paunchy all-in-one routers. But there is something to be said for the company\u2019s ambition. For many homes, Wi-Fi has become the de facto gateway to the wider world. Eero offers slices of that sphere.",

        "article": "\"I feel like we dodged a bullet with the Romney administration.\" Amen. Every time I see a clip of that artificial human speaking, I get chills up my spine. But worse is what's indicated by the first line of this post: \"Mitt Romney's transition team had plans to inject a heavy dose of corporate America into the federal government.\" That's just appalling. The virtually unrestrained power of corporate America is at the root of most of our problems already! Like jobs that pay so little, full-time workers have to go on food stamps (See: Wal-Mart.) Like the rising taxes on the middle class (because corporations like GE and AT&T don't pay *any.*) Like pollution and destruction of the environment (See: Koch brothers, Massey Energy). Like the collapse of the economy in 2008 (See: Banks too big to fail, unrestrained greed, Nationwide mortgages, too many more to mention). Like a national media that is essentially owned by five corporations, that demonizes the left while playing stenographer to the right. (See: Washington Post, CNN, most networks -- not to mention the right-wing \"entertainment complex.\" Compare, for example, the skimpy and hostile coverage of any left-wing protest -- like thousands of anti-war protesters during the Iraq War, or the hundreds of thousands during the Occupy movement -- to the blanket, largely approving coverage of any right-wing protest -- like a couple dozen \"Tea Partiers\" financed by and bused in to Washington by big corporations.) Like a Congress that institutes ALEC-written bills, and ignores the will of the electorate in favor of their corporate sponsors (See: Failure of background-check law). I could go on in this vein, but instead I'd like to remind everyone that our government is supposed to be US. It's supposed to be \"We the People.\" But Reagan turned that idea on its head. He took a fringe idea -- \"government isn't the solution, it's the problem\" -- and made it a solemn canon on the right, to which the left pays deference. And it's a terrible idea. And it's insulting. WE are supposed to be the government. So when Reagan said \"government is the problem,\" he was saying \"the American people are the problem.\" And the right wing has spent the last 30 years excising the power of common people from their own government. Look at everything Republicans propose, and virtually every idea has at its heart the elimination of our power to have a say in what government does. Or more to the point: Elimination of our power to defend ourselves from corporations. That's the heart of \"tort reform,\" if you've ever wondered what that was and why Republicans are so insistent on it. Further, government isn't supposed to work hand-in-glove with corporations. Government is supposed to be OUR DEFENSE from the power of corporations. Government is the only counter-weight to the enormous power of corporations. Government is supposed to regulate corporations so that they don't run roughshod over us, as they inevitably will. But you'll note that Republicans are four-square against regulation. ANY regulation. Corporations, like the big banks on Wall Street, are supposed to be trusted to regulate themselves. The Republican theology is that \"the invisible hand\" of the marketplace will regulate corporations. (Which is not at all what Adam Smith was saying, but I digress.) Gee, how well has that worked out? (See: Economic collapse, 1929 and 2008.) No, Mr. Romney, we do not need more corporate influence on government. There's plenty already, and it's already too much. Our government is supposed to be of the people, by the people and for the people, not of the rich, by the rich and for the rich. That's what every other government in the history of the world has done, and the inevitable outcome of those systems has been consistent: Fascist feudalism. (See: China.)",

        "article": "Revelation that the National Security Agency is mining vast amounts of private data from American telephone and Internet users may be generating outrage and fierce debate here in the U.S. but so far, the story does not appear to have attracted much attention abroad. When foreign media outlets have paid attention, it\u2019s mostly been to report on the possibility that U.S. spy agencies could access the social media accounts of foreigners who use U.S.-based services such as Facebook. Such major American political controversies are typically big news abroad, so the relatively muted reaction this time around is unusual. Perhaps, as some U.S.-watchers suggest, this may say more about Americans\u2019 particular sensitivities to perceived government invasions of privacy than about foreign indifference. With the exception of the U.K. and Canada, where papers have been following the story closely, foreign media has given the NSA story relatively little coverage. Media outlets abroad seem not even to rank the story very high within their international coverage \u2014 Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s announced split with his wife still seems to dominate. And a number of regional stories received more attention. In Africa, the U.K. government apology to Kenyan victims of the 1950s Mau Mau uprising seems to rate higher. Asian outlets are giving more airtime to planned talks between the Koreas and even Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s upcoming summit with President Obama. Turkey\u2019s protests and Syria\u2019s ongoing fighting are attracting more attention in Middle Eastern outlets, including the Iranian outlets that are often so keen to needle the U.S. When foreign outlets do show interest in the story, it\u2019s mostly to ask what it means for them. The news that Facebook and Google may be included in the NSA\u2019s data collection program, known as PRISM, have set off fears around the world that non-American users might have their data compromised. A story in Le Parisien, a French newspaper, noted that Facebook and Google users in France could theoretically be the focus of NSA snooping. A Dutch outlet noted a similar backlash among tech and privacy groups within the Netherlands. Globo News, a prominent Brazilian TV news station, was one of the few international outlets to report on the story primarily for the debate it\u2019s sparked within the U.S., rather than for how it might affect Brazilian social media users, as other outlets in the country did. Surprisingly, there\u2019s been little opprobrium from foreign state media outlets in countries such as Iran or Russia, which typically take gleeful shots at the U.S. for such privacy abuses, eager to counter U.S. criticism of their own countries. Moscow-run RT did cover the story, of course. But within Iran, some of the most comprehensive coverage came not from state-linked media but from the BBC\u2019s Persian service. China\u2019s coverage has been tepid, overshadowed by the Xi-Obama summit and local stories, with little of the usual finger-wagging in Chinese state media that seeks to assure its viewers that U.S. freedoms aren\u2019t so great after all. But that could change. \u201cCoverage was tentative, which is common for sensitive overseas stories,\u201d Adam Minter, a Shanghai-based journalist, said. \u201cI bet we\u2019ll see a more robust approved narrative soon.\u201d Maybe so, but Chinese Web users themselves, often glued to U.S. news, don\u2019t seem too interested. That might in part be a function of China\u2019s much more intrusive surveillance state. but it\u2019s worth noting that Web users in open societies, such as India, also seem to be devoting little attention to the story, based on social media searches. The story does seem to have generated a very different sort of discussion: about Americans and their unusually suspicious view of their government and at times fervent rejection of state intrusion into their lives and private data. \u201cI think America is one of very few countries where this NSA thing would be much of a story. And I mean that as a compliment,\u201d Tom Gara, an Australian Wall Street Journal reporter previously based in the Middle East, wrote on Twitter. Hussein Ibish, a Lebanese-American member of the American Task Force on Palestine, responded, \u201cDepends on your expectations. By U.S. standards, it\u2019s completely outrageous. Elsewhere, few would care much.\u201d Issandr El Amrani, a Moroccan journalist well known for his coverage of the Middle East, put it bluntly: \u201cAmreeka is special about these issues.\u201d",

        "article": "The Fox News debate moderators treated Donald Trump like any other presidential candidate. They pressed him to explain past statements including his comments on Mexican immigrants and his misogynistic rhetoric. They queried him on policy flip-flops (e.g., on single-payer healthcare, on abortion) and on his financial support for Democrats. Trump and his supporters then spent a good deal of Friday bellyaching that Fox had been too tough on him. He crudely insulted Megyn Kelly. He whined, \u201cI think the questions to me \u2014 and that\u2019s why I\u2019m so honored \u2014 the questions to me were much tougher than the questions to anybody else.\u201d Actually, they weren\u2019t. Trump\u2019s defenders deep in the heart of the right-wing echo chamber were incensed Trump would be asked to defend his record and egregious language. For a group that dishes it out unmercifully to every insufficiently conservative Republican and to all liberals, they sure seem squeamish when their pet candidate is on the receiving end. It is wrong to say he was treated more harshly than other candidates. Jeb Bush got grilled on Common Core and immigration; Ohio Gov. John Kasich had to explain his stance on Medicaid expansion; Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker was asked about his 180 on comprehensive immigration reform; and, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) was pressed to explain how he could be president when he can\u2019t even get along with the GOP Senate colleagues. But unlike these other candidates Trump whined during the debate. (\u201cWhat I say is what I say. And honestly Megyn, if you don\u2019t like it, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve been very nice to you, although I could probably maybe not be, based on the way you have treated me.\u201d) The day after the first Republican presidential debate of the 2016 election, the social media conversation turned to Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly and her questions for the candidates. (Fox News Channel) Later on Friday Trump went a tick too far even for the right wing. The Post reported: Conservative commentator Erick Erickson on Friday night disinvited GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump from speaking at an activist conference he is hosting here this weekend, citing disparaging remarks Trump made hours earlier on CNN about Fox News Channel anchor Megyn Kelly. . . . Trump\u2019s CNN interview Friday evening instantly drew controversy and criticism after he said Kelly, one of the moderators of Thursday\u2019s Republican presidential debate in Cleveland, \u201chad blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever.\u201d Erickson, a Fox News regular and face of the popular RedState blog, has long been a foe congressional GOP leaders and an ally of conservative grass-roots organizers. He has also drawn criticism for saying impolitic things, once calling retired Supreme Court Justice David Souter an \u201c[expletive] child molester\u201d and First Lady Michelle Obama a \u201cMarxist harpy.\u201d He has since apologized for both comments. Trump\u2019s words about Kelly simply went too far, Erickson said Friday, making him, someone who enjoys and appreciates barbed political rhetoric, uncomfortable and queasy. And with his invited guest dominating the 2016 race, and few if any conservatives reining him in, Erickson thought he\u2019d try. It is ironic and sad that it is only when Megyn Kelly is attacked that the RedState and like-minded activists take offense. They did not disown him when he called Mexican immigrants rapists and murderers or when he insulted POWs. The lesson here is that their own toleration and encouragement of incendiary rhetoric and disregard of civility enabled Trump, who now is an embarrassment even to them. Attacking Fox from the right was a sign both of Trump and his supporters\u2019 desperation and delusion. Fox is trying to \u201ctake out\u201d Trump? On the contrary, the cable news giant has milked his candidacy for ratings and drew in a stunning 24 million viewers for the first debate. The last thing Roger Ailes and company want is to see Trump disappear. Moreover, Trump is still exempt from serious policy questions. (What is his tax reform plan? How would he balance the budget?) It\u2019s obvious that Trump had his bubble burst in the debate, but his post-debate temper tantrum now threatens to marginalize him even among staunch conservatives. Characters such as Trump (and defenders of extreme and less adept candidates) don\u2019t like being challenged on national TV. Well, too bad. As Trump would say, voters \u201cdon\u2019t have time\u201d for complainers. \u201cAnd to be honest with you, this country doesn\u2019t have time either. This country is in big trouble. We don\u2019t win anymore,\u201d as Trump put it when asked about his vile comments about women. The problem is that Trump isn\u2019t a real candidate and is not a real front-runner. He\u2019s the flavor of the month, the Don Rickles of politics, a bully and a buffoon. He brags that he made millions in Atlantic City while firing over a thousand workers and that he gave money to Hillary Clinton to get her to come to his wedding. (Why would he want her there? No other GOP contender would.) He revels in his ignorance. As such, he is getting nowhere near the White House (even by invitation). Sensing his 15 minutes of fame is almost up, Trump does what he always does when challenged or embarrassed \u2014 double down on his crazy talk and insult his critics. In this case it is backfiring spectacularly. Conservatives have called his tune and now seem ready to move on to find a viable candidate. From taking a jab at Rosie O'Donnell to consoling Sen. Rand Paul on a difficult night, here are Donald Trump's memorable lines from his first GOP presidential debate.

        "article": "Canada ranks last among 11 OECD countries in a new survey in terms of how quickly people can get in to see their regular family physicians, showing \"where a person lives does matter,\" says the Health Council of Canada. The finding was published in the council's final bulletin, based on data from the 2013 Commonwealth Fund International Health Policy Survey of the General Public. The council, an independent national agency, has been reporting on health-care renewal since its creation in 2003. The report, titled \"Where You Live Matters: Canadian views on health care quality,\" focuses on differences across the provinces, comparisons among the 11 OECD countries that took part in the survey between March and June 2013, and changes in Canada\u2019s performance over the past decade. \"What we find is that Canada is really not keeping pace with a lot of these other countries,\" Mark Dobrow, the group's director of analysis and reporting, said in an interview. \"The highest performing province might be looking pretty good in Canada, but be the worst performing if you compared it to all the other countries in the survey.\" More than a third of Canadians in a new report said their regular doctor did not seem informed about care they had received in the emergency department, a finding that has not improved since 2004. (Paul Chiasson/Canadian Press) For example, 50 per cent of respondents in Ontario said that on the whole, the health-care system works pretty well, compared with 23 per cent in Quebec. The report notes that improvement in reducing wait times has been modest and is often lacking, and concerns Canadians. Only 31 to 46 per cent of Canadians, depending on the province, could get an appointment the same day or the next day, not including emergency department visits. Since patients who don't have a primary care provider go to the emergency department, the two waits are related, Dobrow said. Brantford, Ont., resident Richard Kinsella said he had trouble finding a family doctor when he moved to the city east of Hamilton 15 months ago. Kinsella said people in Brantford commonly turn to the emergency department. \"The emergency, I've been twice, and I was there waiting over six hours.\" Family physician Dr. Nandini Sathi's practice is now able to see more patients within 48 hours of when they call. (CBC) People in the U.S. have quicker access to their family doctors, with 48 per cent of those polled saying they could get a same-day or next-day appointment, ranking second last among the 11 countries. Germany was listed as first in how quickly residents saw their doctors, at 76 per cent, followed by New Zealand at 72 per cent. Dobrow said the report raises important questions about the wide variations among provinces in areas such as access to after-hours care, emergency department wait times, affordability of care, co-ordination among care providers, and uptake of screening programs. \"Do we have the rights goals for our system? Are we looking at better health, better care, better value for all Canadians?\" he said. In September, the council suggested that provinces pay attention to issues such as leadership, having the right types of policies, and legislation and capacity building. For example, overall resources in primary care could be increased by expanding scopes of practice of some health professionals and improving their interdisciplinary training. At Toronto's Wellpoint Clinic, the physicians changed to an \"open access\" system, meaning patients no longer make appointments weeks in advance. Exceptions include people who need to prebook wheelchair transit services or a physical checkup. \"As physicians, we were worried that we would become inundated with patients on a daily basis,\" said family physician Dr. Nandini Sathi. \"In fact, what's happened it's opened up a little bit more time throughout the day for patients who need to be seen.\" Previously, a non-urgent patient may have had to wait up to 10 days or sometimes longer if a doctor was on vacation. \"Now it really is 48 hours,\" Sathi said. More urgent care slots are also available. The other findings in the report include: \"We still use hospital emergency departments for too much of our primary care. And we show largely disappointing performance compared to other high-income countries, some of which have made impressive progress,\" the report\u2019s authors concluded. Commenting on the findings, Health Minister Rona Ambrose's office said, \"Our government is delivering the tools the provinces and territories need to deliver health care in their jurisdictions,\" and reduce health wait times. The other countries included in the survey are: Australia, France, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom and United States.",

        "article": "Gov. Cuomo meets with Daily News Editorial Board on Oct. 16, with his budget director, Bob Megna, looking on. It\u2019s getting less neighborly between two political heavyweights: Gov. Cuomo and his New Jersey counterpart, Chris Christie. The two outsized personalities have had a good relationship during Cuomo\u2019s first three years in office, working together on a push for federal aid following Hurricane Sandy, controlling the bistate Port Authority and even occasionally having dinner together. But that has been tested in recent weeks \u2014 even as those close to the two are playing down any tension. \u201cWe now have the bistate presidential skirmish, and this is the first round,\u201d said veteran Democratic consultant Hank Sheinkopf. The first incident that may have frayed cordial ties between the two govs occurred after Christie, head of the Republican governors association, met with Westchester County Executive Rob Astorino, who is considering a challenge against Cuomo, a Democrat, next year. Cuomo publicly said that Christie had called him to rebut a report that he told Astorino he was prepared to go all out to help him beat the Democratic governor next year. RELATED: LOVETT: PALADINO WARMS UP TO ASTORINO Cuomo\u2019s comments put Christie in an awkward situation with the national Republican Party, already wary of him because of his embrace of President Obama post-Hurricane Sandy. More recently, Cuomo was virtually silent over a Port Authority controversy in which a Christie appointee ordered two of three lanes on the George Washington Bridge shut down for several days in September, leading to traffic delays of up to four hours that spilled into Fort Lee, N.J. Some insiders said he was letting Christie twist in the wind. Port Authority Deputy Executive Director Bill Baroni said the lanes were ordered closed to conduct a traffic study \u2014 a statement contradicted by PA Executive Director Pat Foye, a Cuomo appointee. RELATED: NY STATE VOTERS LIKE CHRISTIE OVER CUOMO New Jersey Democrats said the move was retaliation against the Democratic Fort Lee mayor for not endorsing Christie\u2019s reelection this year. Cuomo referred to the incident last week as a New Jersey issue. Baroni and another Christie appointee have since resigned from the Port Authority. Cuomo spokesman Matt Wing did back up Christie Friday after the New Jersey governor denied a report that he called Cuomo Thursday to complain that Foye was pushing too hard for information about the lane closures. Wing confirmed that Christie called Cuomo not to discuss Foye but to talk about the origin of the report. RELATED: ROB ASTORINO SEEKS CHRISTIE\u2019S HELP TO CHALLENGE CUOMO Those close to Cuomo and Christie denied any major tensions between the two governors, saying they actually like each other. \u201cI can\u2019t think of a past New Jersey and New York governor who have had a better personal and professional relationship,\u201d Wing said Sunday. Even some Cuomo critics say they believe the recent flareups were more a result of circumstance than a break in the relationship. RELATED: CHRISTIE LOYALIST QUITS PORT AUTHORITY OVER LANE CLOSURES Representatives for Christie could not be reached Sunday. But a source close to the Republican governor blamed the Astorino issue on New York GOP Chairman Ed Cox and agreed with Cuomo that the bridge incident is a Jersey issue. \u201cIt seems some New Jersey guys at the Port Authority did something stupid, so what\u2019s the governor of New York going to do?\u201d the Christie source said.

        "article": "Just weeks after Fox dropped \"America's Most Wanted\" after more than two decades, its creator-host, John Walsh, has a new home for the show on the Lifetime network. The deal, announced jointly on Tuesday by Walsh and Lifetime, will return to the air Walsh's weekly criminal roundup, which since 1988 has helped bring almost 1,200 fugitives to justice. The series will return for its 25th season later this year. \"`America's Most Wanted' is a seminal program that provides a very valuable service to both viewers and law enforcement agencies,\" said Lifetime president Nancy Dubuc. \"For more than two decades John Walsh has been leading the fight against crime and it's an honor to partner with him on bringing back this important show.\" \"We've often been called the court of last resort,\" Walsh said. \"Now we are back in the game and ready to saddle up for another season to get justice for victims and put dangerous criminals behind bars.\" In May, Fox announced it was axing \"AMW,\" citing high production costs. At the time the network said it would present four quarterly specials in the coming season. The first of those specials will air in October, and Fox will follow it with the remaining three, Walsh said. But Fox's final weekly \"AMW\" was telecast in June. \"We kept the hotline and website up, and we've caught four guys,\" Walsh said. \"The viewers didn't give up on us.\" Since then, Walsh had been in talks to find a new network. The deal with Lifetime was completed Tuesday afternoon, he said. It was in 1981 that Walsh launched his crime-busting crusade in the aftermath of the abduction and murder of his 6-year-old son Adam. He became an outspoken advocate for tougher laws against sex offenders, more cooperation among law enforcement agencies, and citizen involvement in flushing out fugitives. He was a former hotel executive with no TV experience, but his TV show premiered in April 1988 on the fledgling Fox network and, little more than a year later, it was the first-ever Fox program to rank first in viewership in its time slot. It remained a fixture on the network after that, and during the 2010-11 season, was seen by an audience averaging 5 million viewers. In a happy coincidence, on Saturday, Walsh will get a special Emmy Award saluting his show. The Academy of Television Arts & Sciences will give Walsh its Governors Award at the Creative Arts Emmys ceremony in Los Angeles. The honor goes to a person or organization that makes a substantial impact or demonstrates an extraordinary use of television.",

        "article": "This post originally appeared on the American Express OPEN Forum, where Mashable regularly contributes articles about leveraging social media and technology in small business. On the face of it, they don\u2019t seem to have much in common: Instagram and the beverage industry. One is a hot social media company that lets users take pictures and post them on various social networks. The other is a business that is solidly entrenched in the physical world. Yet, a symbiotic relationship exists. Instagram very much wants real-world brands to endorse it, and beverage brands are always looking for the imprimatur of a hot social media technology. The pairing of Instagram and Lipton Brisk, a PepsiCo brand, illustrates how this relationship works. Jamal Henderson, senior marketing manager for Brisk, says he hadn\u2019t heard of Instagram in late 2010 until he saw fans on Brisk\u2019s Facebook Page discussing it. \u201cWe just kind of dug into that digital insight,\u201d he says. That epiphany coincided with Instagram\u2019s own attempts to cozy up to brands. In January, the company introduced hashtags, which were designed to make it easier for marketers to carry out brand campaigns. It worked. While Instagram has proven to be a draw for fashion brands especially, some beverage brands have had some success as well. Below are three recent examples of purveyors of soft drinks using Instagram to spread their message. And if it can work for soda and fashion, then Instagram can be a valuable asset for any business. PepsiCo's Lipton Brisk initiated a clever use of Instagram around this year's South By Southwest festival. In January, Brisk announced a program soliciting users' photos via Instagram. The prize? Photos selected by Brisk would appear on 4,000 Brisk cans distributed at the event. In what was clearly a case of trying to reach the right kind of consumer rather than seducing the masses, Brisk has cultivated a fairly small following on Instagram -- just around 500 followers. Are coffee mugs photogenic? Apparently. There are more than 57,000 photos tagged #starbucks, says Alexandra Wheeler, VP of global marketing for the coffee giant. The brand is also the biggest on Instagram, with 117,000 followers. \"Photography plays such an important role in how we visually share Starbucks offerings and experiences,\" she says. \"This will continue to be a great network to connect with our customers as it grows.\" Starbucks changed things up this summer when it initiated the #5more tag, asking fans how they'd like to spend five more minutes of the summer. Another innovator is Red Bull, which is using Instagram in novel ways. For instance, the brand's 67,000 Instagram followers were the first to hear Coldplay play at the new Red Bull Soundspace studio at the LA radio station KROQ in October. The brand also ran a photo contest in Hawaii last month and publicly challenged Instagram user @newyorkcity to a race to 100,000 followers, in Instagram comments and on Twitter. \"We mutually agreed to let the winner post a pic on the loser's account,\" says Andrew D. Nystrom, social media manager for Red Bull North America. Does your business use Instagram? Let us know in the comments below.",

        "article": "In 2014, four issues generated enough public concern over enough months for at least 10% of Americans, on average, to identify each of them as the nation\u2019s most important problem. Complaints about government leadership \u2014 including President Barack Obama, the Republicans in Congress and general political conflict \u2014 led the list, at 18%. This was closely followed by mentions of the economy in general (17%), unemployment or jobs (15%) and healthcare (10%). We should not be surprised, because if you include dissatisfaction with Congress and with Obama in the category, you cover a large portion of the electorate. Hard-core Republicans hate the president while hard-core liberals hate the GOP House, while independents want everyone to get along. That said, the survey emphasizes a truism we are likely to see repeated in 2016: Especially in a presidential race, no one issue dominates. (\u201cThe dispersion of public concern seen in 2014 may also have implications for the 2016 presidential election. Should it persist, the lack of a single defining public issue could make candidates\u2019 task of honing a message for the election more complex.\u201d) And it should remind us that more than a list of issues, the electorate is voting for a single individual with distinct characteristics as the chief executive and commander in chief. Pundits tend to fixate on individual policy positions and details in a presidential candidate\u2019s background. But even primary voters who are among the most politically active and informed get an overall sense of a candidate. Is he mature or angry? Is he a staunch conservative or more prone to compromise to get half a loaf? Does he seem comfortable talking about foreign policy, or does the thought of his finger on the button give one the shakes? It certainly is the case that some candidates wear well over time while some, even front-runners, self-destruct. (Remember the Rudy Giuliani presidential campaign?) In 2015, there will be endless bickering and debate in the punditocracy about candidates\u2019 positions, consistency on positions and sincerity (or lack thereof) about their stated positions. Those issues matter but are generally not determinative. (Mitt Romney arguably won the nomination in 2012 because he had gravitas and seemed to be the only credible opponent to go up against a sitting president.) It will therefore be wise to keep an eye on how candidates react to controversy, how they interact with the media, how adept they are at retail politicking in early states, how sound their foreign policy critiques of the president, how they might handle Congress and perhaps most important, how likable they are. That\u2019s the way a lot of people choose their candidate, and Gallup suggests that those considerations may be more important than ever.

Rockwell said his restaurant only offers burger specials on Sundays. The rest of the time they sell southern BBQ. He says most burgers cost between $8-$12, but he's willing to work with a customer on the price of this week's special. \"We can give a small discount, an employee discount, for someone who wants to play along with it,\" he said with a laugh. Rockwell added that it's all in fun and that he just wants to see the Browns do well. \"We took a little heat about it from one guy but we're just having fun,\" he said. \"If you can't have fun with it you probably shouldn't be watching professional sports.\" Hopefully Weeden is taking it all in stride and maybe doing something like this right now:",

The former, who banked an estimated $75 million over the last year, still earns the bulk of his money from Seinfeld reruns; while the latter two, who respectively pulled down $38 million and $35 million during the 12-month period, relied on their nightly shows--in O'Brien's case, his nightly show's severance--for the majority of their annual income. In Pictures: America's 10 Top-Earning Comedians \"To stay on top in this economy, you've got to work a lot harder,\" says Live Nation ( LYV - news - people ) Comedy President Geof Wills of a business he calls Darwinian. \"The ones who get hurt are the comedians who don't realize that they have to adapt the environment they're currently in.\" He expects more acts to adjust their ticket prices and venue sizes, while audience members will continue to wait longer to purchase their tickets and remain unwilling to shell out for just anyone. But in his experience, top acts are still able to sell out arenas around the country without much trouble, including rising stars like Daniel Tosh and Joel McHale, who are poised to make this list in the future. Parallel Entertainment Chief Executive J.P. Williams has had to get creative promoting his clients, who include Jeff Foxworthy, Bill Engvall and Larry the Cable Guy. Earlier this year he began packaging together on certain nights three of the four members of what was once the popular Blue Collar Comedy troupe, offering fans three comedians for the price of one. The stand-up business \"mirrors what's happening in our country,\" says Williams. \"It's become more haves and have-nots, and less of the middle.\" Increasingly the \"haves\" are strengthening their acts and their income with work on other platforms, most commonly TV. These shows, be they Tosh's Tosh.0 on Comedy Central or McHale's The Soup on E!, are as much marketing vehicles as they are moneymakers--and in many cases, far more the former than the latter. Take Chelsea Handler, who earned $19 million in the 12-month period ending in June, putting her No. 4 on our list. Like McHale and Tosh, she has a nightly show, E!'s Chelsea Lately, to showcase her humor and build a following. But Handler earned more than twice as much on the road as she did on her show. The remainder of her income came from her collection of bestselling books.",

        "article": "Scientists say that they have discovered a possible explanation for how Alzheimer\u2019s disease spreads in the brain. Alzheimer\u2019s is linked to a buildup of protein plaques and tangles that spread across particular tissues in the brain as the disease progresses. But while the pattern of this spread is well-known, the reason behind the pattern is not. Now scientists say they have uncovered a potential explanation as to why certain tissues of the brain are more vulnerable to Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The vulnerability appears to be linked to variations in the levels of proteins in the brain that protect against the clumping of other proteins - variations that are present decades before the onset of the disease. Related: Hope for Alzheimer's treatment as researchers find licensed drugs halt brain degeneration \u201cOur results indicate that within healthy brains a tell-tale pattern of protein levels predicts the progression of Alzheimer\u2019s disease through the brain [in those that are affected by the disease],\u201d said Rosie Freer, a PhD student at the University of Cambridge and first author of the study. The results could open up the possibility of identifying individuals who are at risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s long before symptoms appear, as well as offering new insights to those attempting to tackle the disease. Charbel Moussa, director of the Laboratory for Dementia and Parkinsonism at Georgetown University Medical Center said that he agreed with the conclusions of the study. \u201cIt is probably true that in cases of diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s we may have deficiencies in quality control mechanisms like cleaning out bad proteins that collect in the brain cells,\u201d he said, although he warned that using such findings to predict those more at risk of such disease is likely to be difficult. But others are less convinced by the results. \u201cThis might be part of the explanation as to why Alzheimer\u2019s disease kills some cells and not others, but it is undoubtedly a complex problem and this is only part of the answer to that problem,\u201d said John Hardy, professor of neuroscience at University College London. \u201cThis paper has only looked at a few brain regions and really only at a few cell [types],\u201d he added. \u201cSo it points towards the idea that there is an intrinsic reason for selectivity but it does not really prove it.\u201d Related: GM worm study provides 'powerful first step' towards preventing Alzheimer's Published in the journal Science Advances by scientists from the University of Cambridge, the research involved the analysis of data relating to more than 500 brain tissues from six healthy individuals, aged between 24 and 57 years of age. The team looked at the levels of a family of molecules known as mRNA, that are encoded by genes and which are required to produce proteins. From this analysis, the researchers found that they were able to predict the levels of proteins across the brain, allowing them to map the levels of proteins associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The scientists found that regions of the brain with higher levels of proteins prone to clumping in plaques and tangles corresponded to regions that generally show early evidence of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The team also found a link between the susceptibility of regions to Alzheimer\u2019s disease and levels of a group of proteins that are known to affect the clumping of those that form plaques and tangles. The scientists found that the \u201cvulnerability map\u201d, produced by looking at the levels of these proteins in the brains of healthy individuals, is consistent with the map of how Alzheimer\u2019s progresses. Related: Alzheimer's researchers find molecule that delays onset of disease That, the researchers say, suggests that the vulnerability of particular tissues to Alzheimer\u2019s disease could, in part, be down to a combination of higher levels of plaque and tangle-forming proteins and problematic levels of proteins that affect their clumping. The scientists say the findings could lead to new ways to predict an individual\u2019s risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \u201cAlthough we all have these patterns, in some people the patterns are more extreme, and in some others are less. Those in which the imbalance is greater, are more at risk,\u201d said Michele Vendruscolo, co-author of the research, although he stresses that research to back up the suggestion has yet to be carried out. Dr David Reynolds, chief scientific officer at Alzheimer\u2019s Research UK, said: \u201cThese findings suggest that our susceptibility to Alzheimer\u2019s may not only be dictated by abnormal changes in the brain, but by how our brains are hardwired to react to those changes.\u201d \u201cUnderstanding the molecular mechanisms that underpin susceptibility to diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s has the potential to open the door to new treatment and prevention approaches,\u201d he added. \u201cBuilding a complete picture of the biology driving a complex disease like Alzheimer\u2019s gives scientists the best chance of developing effective treatments against it.\u201d",

        "article": "Watch Sen. Jeanne Shaheen and Republican Scott Brown face off in a debate, airing on CNN at 11 p.m. ET Thursday. Londonderry, New Hampshire (CNN) -- A new CNN/ORC poll shows a statistical dead heat between New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen and her GOP opponent Scott Brown, with Shaheen at 49%, Brown at 47%, and a margin of error of plus-or-minus 4%. Perhaps even more telling is another politician's approval rating, and he's not even in the Granite State. President Barack Obama has only a 39% approval rating in New Hampshire, the new poll shows. Fifty-seven percent of voters say they disapprove of the way he is handling his job. That's a far fall for a president who beat his Republican opponents here in the Granite State overwhelmingly in both 2008 and just two years ago in 2012. And that's part of the problem. Brown and his supporters are tying the incumbent senator to the president, as exemplified by a recent campaign sign from Brown supporters: \"Stand with Obama, vote for Shaheen.\" It's why Brown rarely speaks a sentence without tying Shaheen to the president. \"She's voting with the president 99% of the time,\" Brown told us over and over, just has he did minutes earlier at a small business event here earlier this week. Shaheen is just as disciplined with her responses. \"You know, Scott Brown can talk about 99 percent all he wants,\" Shaheen told us later in Exeter. \"This race is not between the President and Scott Brown, this race is between me and Scott Brown.\" Shaheen has something going for her that some Senate colleagues around the country in tough races do not. She is a former governor who is not only well known, but relatively well liked. Her favorability rating in the CNN/ORC poll is 52%, much higher than the president's. Brown is under water -- with 50% saying they have an unfavorable view of him, 48% favorable. Shaheen tries to exploit that by painting him as an opportunist -- repeatedly reminding voters that two years ago Brown was a senator from Massachusetts, until he lost. \"When he was in Washington representing Massachusetts he was there for the corporate special interests,\" Shaheen told CNN. \"I'm going to continue to remind people what he represented when he was in Massachusetts and it wasn't our middle-class families, it wasn't our small businesses, it wasn't what's good for New Hampshire,\" Shaheen told us. Brown and other Republicans insist he has beaten the carpetbagger issue by visiting with New Hampshire voters all over the state (he still drives the beat-up pickup truck that became famous in 2010 when he won Ted Kennedy's Senate seat in a Massachusetts special election). When asked about his move on the campaign trail, Brown notes that he was born in the Granite State and has family ties that go back generations. \"We have long and strong ties to New Hampshire and so does Senator Shaheen. We both care about New Hampshire so let's talk about where we're going, not about where we've been,\" Brown said. Another way strategists here in both parties agree Brown has made gains is by seizing on ripped-from-the-headlines national-security issues like the threat from ISIS and Ebola, and playing them as examples of how Washington is broken. Shaheen calls it fear-mongering, which Brown naturally dismisses. \"What I hear is that people are deeply concerned about the border, they're deeply concerned about ISIS, they're deeply concerned about the lack of clear and coherent foreign policy, and the fact that Senator Shaheen is on the Foreign Relations Committee and has endorsed those incoherent policies from day one,\" Brown told us. The ISIS threat does hit home here in a unique way. The first American beheaded, James Foley, was from New Hampshire. While Brown's campaign aides are quite candid that they believe their path to victory is to nationalize the race by linking Shaheen to the President and playing up national-security issues, Shaheen is trying hard to keep it local. She is already known as someone with exceptional constituent services, now as senator and before that as governor. Even GOP sources here speak admiringly of her commitment to returning regularly for local events throughout her last six years in the Senate. Shaheen insists that is what people are most about. \"It's the people who are working now up at the Berlin prison because I went in and fought to get that prison open after it sat empty for 12 years, its the 12 people who are in their homes because I worked with them when they were being foreclosed on,\" Shaheen told us. \"I was at Lincoln Financial in Concord yesterday I didn't get one question about a national issue,\" she said. Keeping it local is a national Democratic strategy, in a climate where disapproval of the President and Washington in general leaves them little choice. Democrats are using it in North Carolina, too, with incumbent Kay Hagan as they pummel her GOP opponent on state education issues. Whether that strategy can work here and elsewhere may determine whether Democrats can keep control of the Senate during Obama's last two years in office. CNN's Adam Levy contributed to this report.",

        "article": "Dr. Omar Ibrahimi expects to spend up to $20,000 this year updating systems at his private practice in Stamford, Conn. On April 8, Microsoft (MSFT, Fortune 500) will no longer provide security updates, or \"patches,\" for its Windows XP operating system. This means computers running on XP -- and even machines like ATMs -- will be largely unprotected against viruses and cyber attacks. While Microsoft declined to disclose how many small businesses currently use Windows XP, Forrester Research estimates about 6% of companies' PCs will still be using it by the April deadline. Experts say those are predominately small and medium-sized firms. \"A year ago, 35% of machines for our small business customers [about 1 million machines] were still on XP,\" said Sergio Galindo, general manager with GFI Software, which provides IT support to small and mid-sized businesses. \"I couldn't believe it.\" (That's since dropped to about 23%.) Related: Microsoft is about to take Windows XP off life support What does this mean for those businesses on April 9? Not a lot -- at first, said Galindo. XP will keep working, and businesses that rely on it will keep functioning. But the risks will compound over time. \"It's like expired milk,\" said Galindo. \"If you drink it one day after it expires, you're OK. But after a month, the risk is exponentially greater.\" The risk can't be overstated, said Thomas Hansen, vice president of small and medium business at Microsoft (MSFT, Fortune 500). In fact, Microsoft's own research has shown that Windows XP, released in 2001, is five times more susceptible to viruses and cyberattacks than Windows 8, its newest operating system. Microsoft announced in September 2007 that it was planning to phase out Windows XP in order to give people plenty of time to prepare. \"The world and technology has moved on,\" said Hansen. \"This is a decade-old technology that doesn't fit in the modern world.\" Related: Tax season unleashes cyberattacks Migrating to the new platform requires firms to invest in new software and hardware. Upgrades could run from several hundred dollars to thousands, depending on the size of the firm and the age of the machines. \"If you're still running XP, chances are that your computer is at least 10 years old,\" said Galindo. \"Businesses might be better off updating their devices anyway.\" On average, small businesses spend more than $400 on repairs for PCs that are four years or older, said Hansen. \"Running old technology is costly, and it hampers productivity,\" he said. \"But you can get a new PC that's running Windows 8 for about the same price.\" Dr. Omar Ibrahimi is bracing to spend much more than that to upgrade the systems at his dermatology practice in Stamford, Conn. \"All of our computers run Windows XP, and we've invested a lot of money in our systems,\" he said. \"Microsoft's decision to pull support for it has upset a lot of people.\" Ibrahimi expects to spend between $15,000 and $20,000, which will include buying new machines and hiring IT consultants to help with setup and training. Related: 6 most dangerous cyberattacks Eric Marcus has seen both sides of the issue. His IT firm, Marcus Networking in Tempe, Ariz., caters to small and medium-sized businesses and has updated more than 1,400 workstations in the last five months. He also spent $20,000 replacing 15 laptops at his own business with machines that run Windows 7. It's a cost he budgeted for, but many of his clients have struggled with the expense. \"They have to pay for new equipment and our time. It adds up,\" he said. And some businesses, he's discovered, run proprietary programs that are only compatible with XP. Microsoft's Hansen said the company is aware of that problem and is working with software developers. \"We don't have the perfect answer yet on how to solve that situation,\" he said.

        "article": "Image: Mashable Composite AP/Amy Sancetta Right under the noses of J.D. Salinger fans and the publishing world, three out-of-print short stories by Salinger were legally republished and have been available since May. The stories \"The Young Folks,\" \"Go See Eddie\" and \"Once a Week Won't Kill You\" were published by small, independent publisher Devault-Graves after a very careful, arduous process of acquiring the rights. According to their website, the book, entitled Three Early Stories, was released in May 2014 in paperback, ebook, and audiobook formats, all available on Amazon. \"The Young Folks\" and \"Go See Eddie\" were the first and second stories Salinger ever published. All three stories have been previously published in magazines in the 1940s: \"The Young Folks\" in Story magazine in 1940, \u201cGo See Eddie\u201d in the University of Kansas City Review, also in 1940, and \u201cOnce a Week Won\u2019t Kill You\u201d in Story magazine in 1944. This book is the first by Salinger to be legally published since Salinger himself wrote the story \"Hapworth 16, 1924\" for The New Yorker in 1965. The 2013 documentary Salinger and the accompanying book started the mania over new Salinger work when it was revealed that previously unseen and unpublished fiction would be published from 2015-2020, per Salinger's own orders before his death in 2010. Devault and Graves were inspired to research the rights to Salinger's out-of-print stories after the documentary came out. Devault and Graves began to research the rights to the Salinger\u2019s 21 early stories \u2014 all written before Catcher in the Rye was published in 1951 \u2014 after learning of their existence in Salinger, Shane Salerno\u2019s 2013 documentary about the reclusive author. The pair discovered that three stories had never at any time been registered to Salinger. \u201cWe knew we had a shot at obtaining the rights,\" explained Graves, \"and the game began.\u201d After an \u201cexhaustive\u201d search that involved a team of intellectual property attorneys and expensive searches by the Library of Congress, the Devault-Graves Agency was able to legally secure world rights to the three works. Graves admitted he and Devault understood that if they \u201cstepped one inch over the line\u201d the Salinger Trust would \u201cnail\u201d them. This publication follows on the heels of a Salinger leak last year of three unpublished stories that were protected by rights. Given the elaborate lengths that Salinger went through in his lifetime to keep his published but uncollected short stories from being republished, it is almost too good to be true that Devault-Graves discovered that the rights were available to these three stories after learning about them from the documentary. However, everything about the publishing triumph is perfectly legal, and hopefully skeptical Salinger fans will be satisfied. Three Early Stories includes original illustrations by Anna Rose Yoken.

        "article": "What happens when a man destined for the clergy suddenly believes himself to be unfit for the position? What can a man do, expecting that his career would be to serve God, and then be so shattered by an experience that he does not feel worthy of the church? This was the dilemma faced by a man named Edwin Barlow, as detailed in the memoir \"Teacher of the Year: The Mystery and Legacy of Edwin Barlow.\" By most accounts, Edwin Barlow was just another child of the Depression. Born in 1922 to a family on the outskirts of Boston, Barlow was a devoted attendee of Sacred Heart Church. From a very young age, his giving spirit and generosity were noted by the clergy -- and there was every expectation that he would enter the seminary. Alas, World War II intervened. Edwin Barlow was in a difficult position. The only thing he was more devoted to than the church was his mother, Agnes. She was a strong and kind woman, but when her alcoholic husband was found dead on a Detroit street, Barlow and his brothers all chipped in to maintain the household. Edwin Barlow had so devoted himself to serving God that he was eminently qualified to sit out the war as a conscientious objector. Every fiber of his being told him that war was wrong -- regardless of how just it may be -- and that taking a man's life was still in violation of God's commandment. Yet in an act of extraordinary sacrifice, Barlow joined the Army, for the sole purpose of sending his meager paycheck back home to his mother. The sacrifice amounted to something far greater than he could have ever expected. He served with the 17th Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron, which rip-roared across Northern France just weeks after the Normandy invasion, moving so quickly to secure roads and bridges that medics weren't able to travel with them. It was during this campaign that the first of many Nazis fell to shots from Edwin Barlow's rifle. Edwin Barlow was a \"teacher of the year\" during his time in Chappaqua, New York. These justified killings shattered this man. Despite his steadfast faith, Barlow was so devastated by the breaking of God's commandment that he fell into alcoholism, and after returning home, lost his way. He desperately wanted to serve God, yet despite his own clergy's insistence that God forgave him for all acts, especially those occurring in war, Edwin Barlow's own moral compass simply refused to reset. He absolutely could not join the clergy. He sought another path. He considered joining the Christian Brotherhood, founded in 1802 by Venerable Brother Edmund Ignatius Rice, ostensibly to educate Irish Catholics who were otherwise prevented from receiving an education by the Protestant English government. As described, \"a Christian Brother is a layman who takes vows of Poverty, Celibacy, and Obedience, but does not serve in a parish or receive the sacrament of Holy Orders. They may serve the mission of the Church in a variety of ways, including teaching.\" Edwin Barlow did not join the Brotherhood because, according to his brother, God showed him another path. He found a new calling: education. He went to college at Holy Cross and then got his master's in education at Harvard University. Shortly thereafter, he settled in the little town of Chappaqua, New York -- where he taught at Horace Greeley High School for 35 years. There is no simple way to describe his classes. Imagine a cross between John Houseman in \"The Paper Chase,\" a less-sadistic but equally demanding version of J.K. Simmons in \"Whiplash,\" and football coach Bill Parcells. His class was, as one student described it, \"a boot camp for life.\" Yet Barlow taught more than just mathematics -- he taught his students about life. This was tough love, and delivered with references to the teachings of St. Thomas Aquinas in the slyest ways possible. He consistently \"buried the lede,\" so to speak. Aquinas identified faith, hope, and charity as the three theological virtues. Barlow incorporated these into his own life and taught them to us, his students. He maintained his faith. He offered hope to even the weakest of students, teaching them that attention and hard work would be rewarded. Nobody ever knew the stories of charity until well after he died. But not only did he leave everything he owned to the Education Fund, he quietly paid the tuition for several brilliant students who came from lower-income families. Aquinas also identified the four cardinal virtues as prudence (judging between virtuous and vicious actions), temperance (the practice of moderation), justice (the proper allocation of things), and . Certainly two of these virtues played a daily role for Barlow. He was under enormous temptation to give in to alcohol, yet was able to strike a deal with himself to never permit it to affect his teaching. Most of all, however, his greatest teaching was that of fortitude. His class was demanding, and one wrong move from a student could result in a world-class tongue lashing. It was, to a certain extent, an act. Based on the hardships of his early life, he knew his students would be facing a dangerous world and absolutely needed to be prepared. More than that, however, it was fortitude that defined his own life. In Walter Farrell's \"Companion to the Summa,\" the importance of Fortitude is described. \"A man must make the conquest of fear before he can begin to live. He must sustain that conquest of fear as long as he hopes to continue to live humanly. For he is surrounded, indeed, penetrated with dangers; if he shrinks from those dangers, he is forever paralyzed. The dangers will not be dissolved by his cowardly attempts to escape them.\" Edwin Barlow did not shrink from fear. It was his faith in God that propelled him through it. Those of us who studied with him saw just how powerful that faith could be -- even though we never knew of his own struggles, for he kept his entire past a mystery.",

        "article": "FOLK wisdom tells us it\u2019s lonely at the top. This makes intuitive sense: To occupy the sole position atop a hierarchy, to have the sole authority for tough decisions nobody else wants to (or can) make, and to bear the sole responsibility for the consequences of those decisions is, almost by definition, to be alone. Power implies isolation. Yet behavioral science research has demonstrated that power confers psychological resources on its holders that might help stave off the loneliness that can accompany isolation. In recent years, studies have found that power enhances power-holders\u2019 beliefs that they control their own fates, buffers them from stress and creates the perception that others\u2019 are consistently \u201cin their corner.\u201d So is it lonely at the top or not? To find out, we tested the relationship between power and loneliness in a series of studies to be published in a forthcoming issue of Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes. Our research suggests that it is not, in fact, lonely at the top \u2014 not because you\u2019re not alone, but because being alone is not the same as feeling alone. We began by presenting a sample of 309 people from around the world with questionnaires assessing their general feelings of power and general feelings of loneliness. The loneliness questionnaire asked them to indicate how often they felt, for example, \u201cI lack companionship,\u201d and the power questionnaire asked them how much they agreed or disagreed with statements such as \u201cIn my relationships with others, I think I have a great deal of power.\u201d We then computed loneliness and power scores for each participant. Our results revealed a sizable and statistically significant negative relationship between the two: The more powerful people perceived themselves to be in their everyday lives, the less frequently they reported feeling lonely. We also conducted several experiments with American adults and college students. First, we induced them to momentarily experience feelings of high or low power (for example, by asking one group of participants to write about the ways they had power in their daily lives and asking another group to write about the ways they lacked power in their daily lives). Then we gave them questionnaires that asked how often they felt left out, isolated and lacking in companionship. People who reflected on having power reported feeling less lonely than did people who reflected on lacking power. Another study involved participants drawn from Amazon.com\u2019s Mechanical Turk, an online marketplace for advertising and accepting all manner of jobs. We created a boss-subordinate relationship by asking one group of participants to choose seven tasks (e.g., a proofreading assignment, a logic game) for another participant in the marketplace to perform. Other participants, in the subordinate role, were given these assignments to complete. Again, those in the \u201cboss\u201d role consistently reported experiencing less loneliness than participants in the \u201csubordinate\u201d role. In five other studies, we manipulated participants\u2019 feelings of power with a decision task that those in power often face: allocating money and resources. We assigned some participants to divide up a small windfall of money ($1 to $12) with another participant any way they liked (with the option of giving the other participant everything or nothing) and assigned other participants as potential recipients of these allocations. Participants given power over making these financial decisions consistently reported experiencing less loneliness than participants given no financial decision-making power. How to explain these results? We speculate that the psychological benefits of power can substitute for the human need to belong to social groups. In two of our studies, we included a separate questionnaire assessing how much participants experienced this need to belong. The results were clear: Power decreased loneliness by reducing the felt need for affiliation with others. Being alone is not the same as feeling alone. You can have thousands of friends and feel lonely, or have only a single friend and feel connected. The separation from others \u2014 in stature, rank or responsibility \u2014 that power confers does not translate into loneliness. In fact, power has the opposite effect on its possessors, alleviating the need to belong and making them feel less alone. Our research should give further enticement to power-seekers and further angst to those who resent those in power. Not only is it not so lonely at the top; it is far lonelier at the bottom.

        "article": "Depressing news about how unattainable home ownership is in San Francisco just keeps coming. Now, according to HSH.com, a site dedicated to tracking all things related to the national mortgage industry, SF has surpassed New York City. In its quarterly update to \u201cThe Salary You Must Earn to Buy a Home in 27 Metros,\u201d HSH places San Francisco as the #1 most expensive. Along with median home prices from the National Association of Realtors\u2019 first-quarter data, HSH has also calculated the first-quarter average interest rate for 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages. \u201dWe used standard 28 percent \u201cfront-end\u201d debt ratios, and a 20 percent down payment subtracted from the NAR\u2019s median-home-price data to arrive at our figures,\u201d writes HSH on the official report webpage. To these amounts, the survey adds in average insurance and taxes. Not all metros created equal Though 2014 has been widely touted as a tremendous come back year for real estate, that hasn\u2019t translated nationally to incredible hikes in the required salary to own a home. \u201cOverall, buying a home remained very favorable during the first quarter of 2014. It was nearly a 50-50 split between the areas which saw the required salary increase or decrease from the fourth quarter of 2013 to the first quarter of 2014,\u201d according to the survey. Keeping in mind the 27 metros span the nation from east to west coast and many points between, this should surprise no one. Yes, it is still quite affordable to own a home in Detroit. Meanwhile, it\u2019s getting less and less so in those places once considered reasonable. Portland, OR, for example, has moved to the 20th most pricey on the list (#1 being the least expensive, #27 being the most). And the big surprise: San Francisco is #27, beating out New York City in terms of how much you need to make to own. Still, considering not too long ago, one local landlord tried to make a $100K salary a requirement just for renting in San Francisco, maybe that\u2019s not so big a surprise after all. And now, the top and bottom of the list Above, we offer you the least expensive 5 metros, followed by the 5 most expensive. You will see below each metro listed with the salary required to own a home. See all this with the knowledge that the median household income in SF was $73,802 in the last census. 25. New York City: $89,788.69 Since the median sales price factored into this study, we thought we\u2019d look at what that median is now and what it buys. Redfin puts the selling median (for all housing types) currently at $859K. What can you buy at that price? Luckily, still the spectrum from 1 bedroom condos to single-family, multi-bedroom units fall in this range. Still, to much of the rest of the country, a one bedroom condo for nearly a million bucks seems kind of insane. Here\u2019s an example off the MLS now. Take a look and weigh in: crazy or worth it? It\u2019s the San Franciscan\u2019s dilemma. Anna Marie Erwert writes from both the renter and new buyer perspective, having (finally) achieved both statuses.

        "article": "Jon Stewart (ASTRID RIECKEN FOR THE WASHINGTON POST) Comedy Central late-night host Jon Stewart and Fox News Channel Sunday Beltway show host Chris Wallace: now officially in a death match to see who will get in the last word. It all started a couple Sundays back when Stewart went on Wallace\u2019s show as a guest. Why? Your guess is as good as mine, but \u201cto gin up ratings for each guy\u2019s show with incendiary conversation\u201d is usually a good guess in these cases. They\u2019ve been going at it ever since, for which television viewers, and the media, are thankful. A kerfuffle like this can provide us with weeks of entertainment! Monday night, on his \u201cThe Daily Show,\u201d Stewart responded to Wallace\u2019s response to Stewart\u2019s response to the chat they had when Stewart was a guest on Wallace\u2019s show. We\u2019ll give you a second to digest that. Stewart reminded viewers that when he was on Wallace\u2019s show, he declared FNC viewers the most consistently misinformed in every poll. A political fact checking Web site took issue with that and \u201csaid I really shouldn\u2019t have said \u2018every poll\u2019 \u2013 it was just most.\u201d So, on his Comedy Central program, Stewart accepted the correction, but followed it with a \u201c21 Lie Salute\u201d of facts he said the same fact checking site claimed Fox News Channel had gotten wrong. So when, this past Sunday, Wallace told his viewers he would be \u201csetting the record straight about our interview with Jon Stewart, Stewart said he \u201cassumed that Chris Wallace now begins the work of apologizing for Fox\u2019s many false and misleading statements \u2013 they\u2019ll probably do a few per show and carry us into the 2014 mid-terms with a clear conscience.\u201d Wallace did not do that on Sunday\u2019s show. But then, you didn\u2019t really think Stewart expected Wallace to do that, do you? It\u2019s called \u201ccomedy.\u201d And with that set up, Stewart jumped with both feet into the rabbit hole: He showed his viewers a clip of Wallace saying last Sunday that, after \u201csetting the record straight,\u201d that \u201cas we showed today, we don\u2019t go easy on Republicans.\u201d He showed them a clip of Wallace saying, when asked by Stewart during their get-together, that yes, he thought Stewart is an activist and an ideological partisan \u2013 because he takes shots at Democrats, but \u201cmostly to maintain credibility and you\u2019re not as comfortable with it.\u201d \u201cSee the game?\u201d Stewart asked his chortling studio audience, and viewers watching on their screen of choice. \u201cI make fun of conservatives or Republicans because I\u2019m a liberal partisan idealogue. I make fun of liberals or Democrats because I want, as part of my brilliant yet cynical strategy, to maintain enough credibility, to continue making fun of conservatives and Republicans. \u201cAnd that narrative of Conservative Victimization, is the true genius of what Fox News has accomplished,\u201d Stewart continued while his guffawing and harrumphing studio audience went deafeningly silent. \u201cAny editorial judgment in news, or schools, or movies, that doesn\u2019t favor the conservative view, is elitism and is evidence of liberal bias. Whereas any editorial judgment that FAVORS the conservative view, is evidence of merely fairness and done to protect them from liberal bias. \u201cAnd, if you criticize Fox for this game, guess what that\u2019s evidence of? How right they are about how persecuted they are. It is air tighter than an otters [heinie]\u2026They can\u2019t lose. But you know what this whole \u2018victim thing\u2019 makes Fox? Well, perhaps this term a friend of mine used once to describe the current presidential administration is most apt:\u201d Cut to clip from September of 2009 of Wallace telling FNC\u2019s Bill O\u2019Reilly: \u201cThey are the biggest bunch of cry babies I have dealt with in my 30 years in Washington.\u201d",

        "article": "Nick Hornby has got himself some easy headlines by telling punters at the Cheltenham LitFest that they should toss any novel as soon as it gets hard going. Stop when it hurts, he said. Farewell, then, Finnegans Wake. Personally, I\u2019ve always admired Professor George Levine\u2019s approach. Levine announced to the world that he was cancelling all his classes to lock himself away for three months in 1973 to read Gravity\u2019s Rainbow. Eight hours a day. No remission. He emerged, as he put it, \u201cgiddy\u201d but convinced that \u201cThomas Pynchon is the most important American novelist now writing\u201d. Of course not everyone is in a position to make that kind of investment in difficult fiction. It\u2019s not just a book\u2019s difficulty that compels us to ditch it though. The intelligence or stupidity of the reader is a determining factor. As is age. Ten-year-olds devour Harry Potter. I personally can\u2019t make head nor tail out of Rowling\u2019s novels. Why? Because my addled adult brain can\u2019t see the narrative shapes and structures for all the detail and hither and thithering. Conversely, I found Ulysses impenetrable when I first dipped into it (stopping as Nick instructs when the going got tough, around page two if not before), 50 years ago, but can skip through it quite happily now. Perhaps difficult novels get less difficult as you (and they) grow older. However smart you think you are, there will always be novels that make you feel stupid. For some, it is their mission in life. The following are my all time top 10 unfinishables: 1. J by Howard Jacobson - A worthy successor to John Berger\u2019s equally stupefying G. Passing page 50 is an achievement. 2. A Girl is a Half-Formed Thing by Eiemear McBride - Great novel, whatever it means. I suspect a few Booker judges stopped around page 40. Their lips are sealed. 3. If on a winter\u2019s night a traveller by Italo Calvino - Italian jiggery-pokery. It has 12 openings so you can stop at page 2 a dozen times. 4. The Sacred Fount by Henry James - Why did Emily Bront\u00eb have to die so young, and he live so long after he stopped writing readable fiction? Stop at page one \u2013 for all but PhD candidates. 5. The Amazing Marriage by George Meredith - Any Meredith would work here, really. I gave up around page 50 \u2013 my usual tether. 6. Ada by Vladimir Nabokov - He knew readers would keep going for the sexy bits: then didn\u2019t write them. 7. Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace - Like swimming through setting cement. 8. IQ84 by Haruki Murakami - Can 80 million readers \u2013 or whatever it is \u2013 be wrong? Yes. Good opening scene, though. 9.La Disparition by Georges Perec - The one that doesn\u2019t use the letter \u2018e\u2019. Stop with the e-less title. You\u2019ve got the point. 10. Moby Dick by Herman Melville - Read the first 10 chapters and the last three. Avoid the rest. If you want to post: \u201cYou don\u2019t feel stupid, you are stupid,\u201d I\u2019ll take it on the chin. Which novels have you started but never finished? Let us know in the comments below",

        "article": "European stocks rose Monday, partially recovering from a fierce selloff at the end of last week, helped by the Chinese central bank announcing plans to stimulate growth. The Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.7% on the day at just under 407 points, while in the U.S, the S&P 500 had advanced close to 1% by the European close. On Friday, Europe\u2019s main index suffered its worst daily loss in three months, largely due to Greek concerns, but also poor U.S. corporate earnings and China\u2019s securities regulator issuing a strong warning about its stock market and tightened rules on margin lending. Also Friday, Bloomberg suffered a highly unusual global system outage during the first half of the session in Europe, preventing traders, investors and bankers from using their usual communication and trading platforms and forcing some to stall deals. Ian Williams, an economist and strategist at brokerage Peel Hunt, said that Friday\u2019s turbulent session had \u201cunwound some long-standing overbought positions,\u201d which some investors may see as an attractive opportunity to buy back in to the market on Monday. Other strategists said that the early-week recovery may be partially attributable to China on Sunday cutting its bank reserve requirement substantially. It \u201cis being interpreted as a stimulus,\u201d said Paul Donovan, an economist at UBS. UBS -0.05 % This week, however, Greece is expected to dominate the mood in markets and continue to drive a general hunt for assets deemed to be safest during times of stress, especially German government debt. The yield on the German 10-year bond hit multiple record lows last week and late Monday traded just a shade off its all-time low at around 0.076%. Yields fall as bond prices rise. \u201cThe timing of reaching 0% in yield appears more a case of \u2018when\u2019 rather than \u2018if,\u2019 given the tensions evident with regards Greece,\u201d said Mizuho rates strategist Peter Chatwell. Strategists at Citigroup C 0.23 % agreed, saying in their morning note that \u201call the broad parameters are supportive for Bunds\u201d this week. Eurozone finance ministers are due to meet in Riga on Friday to discuss the state of negotiations between Greece and its international creditors. Over the weekend, technical talks between the Greek government and the institutions overseeing the bailout took place in Paris. Negotiations have so far yielded little in terms of progress, and European officials have cautioned that discussions between the two sides are nowhere near the point where bailout money can be disbursed. \u201cIt\u2019s decision time. The next three weeks will be critical for Greece,\u201d said Alberto Gallo, head of macro credit research at Royal Bank of Scotland. RBS -0.14 % \u201cOur base-case scenario is that a partial agreement will be reached on Greece\u2019s new list of reforms. But time is running out, and the probability of cash shortfall is increasing,\u201d he added. The yield on Greece\u2019s two-year government bond was around 28.1% by late Monday\u2014its highest since being issued\u2014while the yield on the 10-year stood at just over 13%. An inverted yield curve, where shorter-term debt yields more than longer-dated bonds, signals that investors foresee a very high risk of default. Unlike during previous periods of concern over Greece however, debt in other southern European countries has remained robust and showed no signs of contagion. Frank Engels, head of fixed income at German asset manager Union Investment, which has around \u20ac 240 billion in assets under management globally, attributed this to \u201cthe economic situation both globally and specifically in Spain, Ireland, Portugal and Italy [having] improved substantially\u201d since the depths of the eurozone crisis. He said that as a result, he remained upbeat on bonds issued by those countries\u2014commonly referred to as Europe\u2019s periphery\u2014and would see any mild selloff in them as a \u201cbuying opportunity.\u201d In currency markets, the euro fell around 0.5% against the dollar on Monday to trade at $1.075, while in commodity markets Brent crude rose 0.1% to $63.46 per barrel. Gold lost 0.8% to $1,193 per troy ounce. Write to Josie Cox at josie.cox@wsj.com",

        "article": "Castro makes rare TV appearance Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- The United States is pushing for what would become nuclear wars against Iran and North Korea, former Cuban leader Fidel Castro said in a rare televised interview Monday. Castro blamed the United States, not North Korea, for the sinking of a South Korean ship that killed 46 sailors. The incident was orchestrated to stir conflict in the region, Castro said. The former Cuban leader, who is 83, said he was disappointed that China and Russia didn't veto a U.N. Security Council resolution for additional sanctions against Iran for its alleged illegal nuclear program. Iran, he said, has been building up for a confrontation for 30 years. If the United States attacks Iran, it will meet a resistance unlike anything it faced in Iraq, Castro said. \"A war there can't avoid becoming nuclear,\" Castro said. One subject Castro did not mention during the hour-long appearance was Monday's release of political prisoners. Castro spoke on Cuban TV on a show called \"Roundtable.\" He appeared in a dark blue tracksuit worn over a plaid shirt and sat on a swivel chair that he shifted at points during the interview. His remarks were based on a column published Monday of a possible nuclear war involving the United States and Iran, sparked by conflict over that country's nuclear activities. News of Castro's television appearance appeared to resonate with some residents in the Cuban capital. \"[It's] extraordinary because we want to feel him, hear him, see him, because we haven't seen him in a long time,\" said Havana resident Ruben Morrejon Fernandez. Monday's appearance was the second Castro sighting in the past few days. Three photographs of Castro surfaced Saturday on a pro-government blog, which claimed the photos were taken last Wednesday. The set of three photos appear to show the ailing Castro meeting with people during \"a surprise visit\" at the National Center of Scientific Investigations in Havana, according to a blog published by columnist Rosa C. Baez. An additional five photos -- appearing to be from the same event -- were published Saturday by the state-run media site Cubadebate. Castro has been largely out of sight since undergoing emergency intestinal surgery in July 2006. He ceded power to younger brother Raul Castro in February 2008. The elder Castro's appearance follows last week's announcement of the largest release of Cuban political prisoners in more than a decade. Cuba's Roman Catholic Church also announced Monday the names of the three more political prisoners set to be freed. They were identified as: Jesus Mustafa Felipe, Omar Rodriguez Saludes and Antonio R. Diaz Sanchez. The first prisoners to be released are expected to arrive in Madrid on Tuesday, a Spanish Foreign Ministry spokesman told CNN on Monday. Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos met with Cuban President Raul Castro and Cuban Cardinal Jaime Ortega last week, after which the prisoner release was announced. The 52 political prisoners Cuba plans to free are the remainder of 75 dissidents jailed during a government crackdown on political opposition in March 2003. They represent roughly one-third of all known political prisoners left on the island, according to Cuba's unofficial Commission on Human Rights and National Reconciliation. CNN's David Ariosto contributed to this report.",

At 25, Madison Bumgarner an old hand at postseason pitching KANSAS CITY, Mo. \u2014 As they dismounted the stage in AT&T Park\u2019s center field where Madison Bumgarner had been presented with the MVP award of the Championship Series after the Giants won the National League pennant, general manager Brian Sabean turned to his 25-year old left-hander. \u201cWhat the hell are you going to do when you grow up?\u201d Sabean asked. Tuesday night, in Game 1 of the World Series against the Royals, Bumgarner will make his 11th postseason start, his 12th postseason appearance (he had one relief appearance against the Phillies in 2010). If the World Series goes five games, Bumgarner will become the third pitcher to make six starts in one postseason, (joining Curt Schilling of Arizona in 2001 and Chris Carpenter of St.Louis in 2011). He\u2019s the unquestioned ace of the Giants\u2019 staff. And he enters the game\u2019s biggest stage with two World Series victories under his belt. It\u2019s an impressive resume for a pitcher who is still just a (really) big kid. Tim Hudson, 39, jokes that Bumgarner actually could be his kid. That\u2019s pushing it (\u201cWell, I\u2019m from Alabama, you know,\u201d Hudson cracked), but Hudson has taken on a parental role. Bumgarner and his wife, Ali, moved into the Hudsons\u2019 house in Cow Hollow about a week ago, after the Bumgarners\u2019 lease ran out. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to put them out on the street,\u201d Hudson said. \u201cWe\u2019re like the Brady Bunch right now. Between my three kids and my two new kids, the house is kind of a wreck.\u201d The neighborhood at the base of Pacific Heights is a slightly different type of \u201ccow hollow\u201d from what Bumgarner is used to. His favorite place is his 125-acre home in rural North Carolina, where his perfect day would include getting up before dawn and feeding his 50 cows and 20 horses. \u201cHe cares about horses,\u201d Brandon Belt said. \u201cThat\u2019s about it.\u201d Bumgarner, called \u201cMaddy\u201d by childhood friends in his hometown of Hudson \u2014 a town of 2,800 where everyone waves to each other \u2014 is a cowboy at heart. When he was a rookie, he and Ali stayed with Jeremy Affeldt, and Bumgarner practiced roping cattle by lassoing Affeldt\u2019s patio furniture. \u201cI\u2019d come home and he\u2019d be spinning this rope, lassoing all my furniture,\u201d Affeldt said. Bumgarner did not perform that trick at the Hudsons\u2019 home. \u201cI don\u2019t think he brought his cowboy stuff with him,\u201d Hudson said. Well, except for his boots. Bumgarner always wears cowboy boots. Earlier this season, Pablo Sandoval tried on a pair of Bumgarner\u2019s boots, then hit a home run. So after that, he started taking Bumgarner\u2019s lucky boots into the dugout. \u201cI\u2019d come back in and say, 'Where my boots at?\u2019\u201d Bumgarner said. \u201cSo I just brought an old pair from home and told him, 'Here, hold onto these until they stop working.\u2019\u201d Bumgarner brings his cowboy mentality to the mound with him. At home games, he takes the field to the strains of the Marshall Tucker Band\u2019s \u201cFire on the Mountain,\u201d and there might not have been more fitting introduction music in the history of baseball. In addition to the refrain \u201cfire on the mountain, lightning in the air,\u201d the lyrics include these: \u201cTook my family away from our Carolina home, had dreams about the west and started to roam.\u201d When Bumgarner first left his Carolina home, drafted out of high school, he was terribly homesick. In the instructional league in Scottsdale, Ariz., in the summer of 2007, the 17-year old would shag balls in the outfield and look up in the sky to see planes flying overhead. \u201cEvery time I saw one, I wished I was on it,\u201d he told friends. In ClassA ball in Augusta, Ga., he went home every off day to see Ali and his family. When he arrived in San Francisco at age 20, no one was quite sure what to make of the huge, quiet kid. \u201cI remember he was quiet. And big,\u201d Tim Lincecum said. \u201cI try to stay away from bigger guys.\u201d Bumgarner impressed his teammates right away, not only with his demeanor on the mound but also with his other abilities. On a trip to Colorado, the team bus broke down. Bumgarner was sitting in the back, yelled, \u201cI\u2019ll take care of it,\u201d popped the hood and helped get the bus running again. \u201cHe\u2019s got skill for days,\u201d Javier Lopez said. \u201cHe can rope things, fix diesel engines. The biggest shock is that he\u2019s just so young and yet so polished. Not only the mental aspects but with all the different pressures and gravity of each game.\u201d Matt Cain has seen the same thing. \u201cHe\u2019s matured mentally with the way he goes about his game plan,\u201d Cain said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like he ever gets flustered with the speed of the game. In big situations, too often we try to do something way different. But he does a good job of settling in and just letting it happen.\u201d Bumgarner is crafting his own legend. \u201cHe\u2019s a mystery,\u201d Hudson said. \u201cHe\u2019s like a unicorn. Is he real or is he not?\u201d He\u2019s real. Real young, and real good. Ann Killion is a San Francisco Chronicle columnist.

        "article": "Based on the best-selling 2006 Swedish novel Snabba Cash by Jens Lapidus, this riveting crime thriller takes place in Stockholm, but key players are Spanish, Serbian and Arab, as well as Scandinavian. The cast is uniformly top-notch and the cinematography is striking. The downbeat tale is morally grounded, without ever being preachy. Director Daniel Espinosa (Safe House) clearly knows how to fashion slick, intelligent and tense action thrillers with multidimensional characters. A palpable sense of dread infuses the lives of three men, all seduced by the lure of quick and large sums of money. Each gets caught up in an elaborate cocaine deal and embroiled with ruthless types who exploit them. JW (Joel Kinnaman) is a brainy Swedish business student from a lower-class background who pastes pictures of elegantly clad male models on the walls of his dorm room so he can emulate their style. He funds his expensive tastes by driving a taxi illegally. Kinnaman, a regular on TV's The Killing, is pitch-perfect in the role, with his smooth good looks barely masking his desperate striving. Jorge (Matias Padin Varela) has escaped from prison and longs to help his struggling sister with the money he hopes to make from one big drug deal. Varela projects an intriguing blend of innocence and cruelty. Easy Money*** out of fourStars: Joel Kinnaman, Matias Padin Varela, Dragomir Mrsic, Lisa Henni, Dejan Cukic, Annika Whittenbury Director: Daniel EspinosaDistributor: The Weinstein Company Rating: R for strong violence, pervasive language, drug content and some sexuality Running time: 1 hour, 59 minutes Opens Friday in New York and Los Angeles Dispatched by his unsavory cab owner boss, JW gets involved in an elaborate chase and saves Jorge's life. The two become friends. Mrado (Dragomir Mrsic), an enforcer for the Serbian Mob, is hot on Jorge's tail. Thrust into the middle of Mrado's thuggish antics is his sweet young daughter, suddenly put in his care. Mrsic is a black belt martial artist, not a trained actor, but he's superb in the morally complex role. It's hard not to root for these guys when they exhibit their wounded humanity: Jorge makes desperate efforts to help his pregnant sister. Mrado attempts to be kinder to his child than his own heartless father was to him and break the cycle of cruelty that scarred him as a boy. A recurring theme is how each of these men was mistreated or abandoned by his father. The film's only weak link is a not very believable love story between JW and Swedish heiress Sophie (Lisa Henni). One of the film's most intriguing elements is the lack of heroes. Each key character is a hustler, trying to do the right thing according to his own skewed sense of ethics. Some of their actions make sense, some are simply foolish, and others inspire revulsion. While it's undeniably exciting as a straight-ahead thriller, there's a fatalistic mood underlying the suspense. Easy Money probes characters' allegiances, and the shifting loyalties of the audience. The result, nimbly woven together, is fascinating.",

        "article": "Tim Webb, 57, landed the enormous Siamese carp after an exhausting 90 minute battle A BRITISH angler has caught the world\u2019s biggest carp \u2013 and he liked it so much that he bought it to take home. Tim Webb, 57, landed the enormous Siamese carp which weighed 222lbs after an exhausting 90 minute battle at a lake in Ban Pong, Thailand. The fisherman, who owns his own fishery in Thailand, lured the carp onto his line using a simple bait of bread and bran rice before engaging in the gruelling battle. He said there were a couple of challenging moments when he thought he\u2019d lost out but perseverance paid off in the end. After being hauled to land, the giant carp tipped the scales at almost 16 stone. It smashed the previous record for a Siamese carp by over 70lbs. Tim, originally from Crawley, West Sussex, needed help from two fellow anglers to pose for a picture with the trophy carp. He was so fond of his catch that he decided to buy it from the lake and put into his own fishery, Palm Tree Lagoon, which is about 25 miles away. He laid a tarpaulin down in the back of a pickup truck, filled it with water and, with the help of six people, hoisted the carp in the back. It was then wrapped in a wet blanket and lifted into Tim\u2019s 3.5 acre lake, which attracts thousands of British anglers each year. Siamese carp are the biggest species of carp in the world and they are found naturally in river basins in Asia. Tim\u2019s catch dwarfed the 150lbs record specimen caught by Brit Andy Harman in Thailand earlier this year. It was also more than three times the size of the biggest carp ever caught in Britain which was by angler Tom Doherty who reeled in a 70lbs specimen in Shropshire just two weeks ago. Tim said: \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing feeling to reel in a fish that is well over the world record. \u201cAs soon as I felt it on the end of my line I knew I had something special. \u201cI had to fight it hard for a long time because in effect I was reeling in a small car. \u201cThere were one or two hairy moments but I managed to bring it to the bank. I was elated but shattered afterwards.\u201d Tim agreed with the owner of the lake to buy the record carp but would not disclose how much he paid for it, although it is thought to be several thousands of pounds. He added: \"It was amazing to actually take it away with me and put it in my own lake. \"Having a fish of that size generates a lot of interest, people will want to come and have a go at trying to catch it.\" Despite smashing the world record, Tim said he would not submit the claim to the International Game Fish Association as they do not accept records from stocked waters.",

        "article": "There were tears among the Manchester City fans Sunday, but there were always going to be tears. Pressed between palms and buried heads, or rolling down smiling cheeks \u2014 the final score would decide which. It has been 44 years since Manchester City last won English soccer\u2019s top division, but it may only be a week before the club celebrates again. Two late goals by Yaya Tour\u00e9 settled that, giving City a 2-0 victory at fifth-place Newcastle and vaulting it over the final substantial hurdle it faced in the title race in the Premier League. Tantalizingly close to the trophy, City needs only to beat relegation-threatened Queens Park Rangers at home next weekend to ensure its first league championship since 1968. Tour\u00e9 broke open an increasingly tense game with a curling 25-yard shot inside the right post in the 70th minute and clinched the victory with a much closer finish after a counterattack in the 89th. Technically City remains tied atop the standings with Manchester United, but both teams understand the math. City\u2019s superior goal difference (plus-63 to plus-55) will most likely be the tiebreaker, which was why United\u2019s players barely celebrated their goals in a 2-0 win over Swansea hours after City\u2019s supporters cried tears of joy at Newcastle. The gap in goal difference means that if City wins by even a single goal against Q.P.R. on Sunday, United would need to beat Sunderland by 10 to steal the title. But win they must. \u201cIt\u2019s emotional, but I can\u2019t forget there is another game,\u201d City Manager Roberto Mancini said. While most of the focus was squarely on the league leaders, there remain other prizes to be won. Newcastle (65 points) remained locked in a tight race with Tottenham (66) and third-place Arsenal (67) for the Premier League\u2019s final two Champions League places for next season. Newcastle\u2019s loss was a serious blow to its hopes until Tottenham tied with Aston Villa, 1-1, just as Arsenal had done with Norwich, 3-3, on Saturday. Only the league\u2019s top four teams earn places in the lucrative Champions League, and City and United \u2014 far ahead with 86 points \u2014 have claimed two of them. Newcastle closes the season at Everton next week, when Tottenham will host Fulham and Arsenal will travel to West Bromwich Albion. Tens of millions of dollars will be forfeited by the odd team out, although sixth-place Chelsea can scramble the math even further by winning this year\u2019s Champions League and claiming the fourth place for itself. The battle is just as fierce at the bottom of the standings. Wolverhampton has already guaranteed it will be one of the three teams relegated for next season, and Blackburn is almost certain to go down, too. Bolton, which employs the United States national team members Tim Ream and Stuart Holden, sits in the third place, but it kept hold of a lifeline by tying West Brom, 2-2, on Sunday. Bolton ends the season at Stoke, where a win \u2014 combined with a loss by Q.P.R. at City \u2014 would be enough to save them.",

        "article": "Venture capitalists are chasing hot areas with planet-scale problems: energy, water, global warming. Industry legends, including John Doerr and Vinod Khosla, have become prominent spokesman for the issues and have pumped huge sums of capital into these markets. In our enthusiasm for green, however, there's a forgotten society and industry segment that remains woefully unaddressed--namely, education. With the advent of social media, and with the revival of entrepreneurship and investments in consumer Internet services, technology-enabled education looks like a huge opportunity for wealth creation. Why have entrepreneurs and investors ignored education? \"The market is relatively tough to crack due to its seasonal nature and the dysfunctional sales cycle which results in wary investors,\" says Edward Fields, chief executive of HotChalk, a free online community application that aims to connect teachers, students and parents from kindergarten through grade 12. Unlike many other efforts, HotChalk seems to be getting real traction. Entrepreneurs have long struggled to sell technology to schools. This struggle and failure has resulted in investor cynicism, so much so that today the segment gets little money and draws few entrepreneurs. Those who do march bravely into the market often languish in an under-capitalized never-never land, not able to take on the big problems due to insufficient funding. Join the discussion: Is there a future in educational technology? Why has it been so hard in the past? Can social networks make a difference? Tell us what you think in the Readers Comments below. To give credit where it is due, junk bond king Michael Milken has been the most notable exception to this rule. He has consistently invested in education through his holding company, Knowledge Universe. One of the best-known examples of Milken's investments is LeapFrog, an educational toy company that literally leaped into prominence with a popular reading technology. Today, Leapfrog is a public company and has just launched a new reading product called Tag. John Doerr, too, has spent several years trying to rally high-impact individuals around his New Schools Venture Fund, which focused on building new charter schools. Fixing schools is tough work. The New Schools Fund has had marginal success, starting some successful charter programs but struggling with \"turnaround\" schools. And that program doesn't aim to develop technology. I believe that HotChalk may become the next example of how to develop a winning formula in educational technology. Think of HotChalk as a social network for teachers, students and even parents. Any teacher can sign up on HotChalk for free. In five minutes they will be able to view another teacher's classroom materials and upload their own lesson plans and get feedback from other teachers. Teachers can send notes, homework assignments and grades to students electronically. Today all students are accustomed to communicating via e-mail or text messages, so it is essential to incorporate this aspect into their education. \"Not to mention the added convenience this gives teachers,\" says Fields, who appreciates the key role that teachers play in the education-technology adoption cycle. In a classic social media way, HotChalk has thus created a \"community\" of teachers, students and even parents, interacting with one another around a software application that makes the process of teaching easier and aligned with 21st century student dynamics. The application ties in with education providers from every niche, including textbooks, supplements and assessment publishers. Here's the brilliance of HotChalk's strategy: The company doesn't even try to sell to school administrators. They are tapping the core users: teachers, students, parents. HotChalk was launched in September 2004, and membership has climbed this year so far to more than 375,000 teachers. More than 7.1 million monthly unique visitors from 188 countries are using the site. That touches 72,000 schools, 93% of which are in the U.S. HotChalk's target market is teachers, students and parents. Teachers globally lack essential educational resources. There are 3.2 million teachers, 55 million students and over 140,000 public and private schools in the U.S. Globally, there are 29 million teachers and 464 million students. The English-speaking international market alone includes an additional 1.3 million teachers. Beyond that is the non-English speaking world, encompassing China, Latin America, the Arab countries and Europe. HotChalk defines the comprehensive global education marketplace as its total available market. How does HotChalk make money? Again, a classical social media principle at work: advertising and partnerships with big industry leaders. HotChalk has received substantial financing from both venture capital and strategic investors. In August 2007, William Oldsey, executive vice president of McGraw-Hill (nyse: MHP - news - people ), learned about HotChalk. He initiated a partnership that would bring McGraw-Hill's significant teacher training and certification tools to users. Then NBC learned about HotChalk's vision, and its management proposed a partnership to distribute its comprehensive news archive as a supplement to traditional educational materials. These, unlike the basic HotChalk application, are paid subscription services. Both NBC and McGraw-Hill have since become equity investors in the company, alongside several venture capital funds, the most well known of which is Silicon Valley's Mohr Davidow Ventures. Today, HotChalk looks to be on track to reach $12 million in revenue this year and aim for over $30 million in 2009. Schools are now part of the program, as the teachers who are already heavy-duty users of the HotChalk offering belong to 72,000 schools. They are helping HotChalk sell school-wide subscriptions without resistance. \"I can't hire sales reps fast enough to meet the market demand,\" says Fields. (Read my full interview with him here.) HotChalk's success, I hope, would cause entrepreneurs and investors to pay attention to the vast untapped potential of the educational technology market. On the list of planet-scale problems, education clearly is one of the most important ones. Sramana Mitra is a technology entrepreneur and strategy consultant in Silicon Valley.

        "article": "Uriel Sinai / Getty Images, file Israeli Arab schoolchildren sit on a bench on in Jerusalem, Israel. By Ranna Khalil, NBC News contributor JERUSALEM - A quiet culture war has broken out in East Jerusalem, the part of the ancient city that Israel conquered during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. Palestinian students have for the first time been given the option to study an Israeli curriculum instead of an outdated Palestinian one, hoping this will help ensure future professional success. But now, some of the 190 students who enrolled in the program say they feel they were fooled into participating and claim they are being indoctrinated. \u201cThey teach us Torah [the Jewish holy book] during history and Hebrew lessons. And they don\u2019t teach us anything about the history of Palestine,\u201d said A.J., a 13-year-old student who enrolled in the pilot program last year in hopes of eventually being accepted into an Israeli university. Families of students interviewed about the program, which was unveiled in 2012 in the Ibn Rushd Boys School and rolled out in four other schools earlier this year, asked not to be identified out of fear that they would be punished by school officials or local authorities. Among the complaints that some Palestinians have about the Israeli curriculum is that it teaches that Jerusalem is united, and that it is the capital of Israel. The curriculum also uses the Biblical terms Judea and Samaria to describe the West Bank, which Israel has occupied since 1967, but which Palestinians hope will one day form part of their independent state. While Israel cites historical claims to the West Bank, the United Nations considers the occupation illegal and most world powers say Israeli settlements there stand in the way of peace. A.J.\u2019s father said he initially thought the Israeli curriculum \u2013 which allows students to take the exams necessary to apply to Israeli universities \u2013 would open up more opportunities for his son. \u201cThey didn\u2019t say they will teach him Torah. So we were fooled. They want to make my son forget his cause,\u201d he said. A.J.\u2019s father said he has requested his son drop the Israeli classes. Ibrahim Al-Khatib, principal at Ibn Rushd in Sur Baher, a neighborhood of East Jerusalem, disagrees with the boy, his father and others complaining about the curriculum. The Israeli material is \u201cmore comprehensive and objective, especially in sciences and the Hebrew language,\u201d he said. A high level of Hebrew is essential to get into Israeli university, and not being completely fluent in it handicaps many Palestinians students. According to Israeli census figures, Palestinians form more than a third of the population of the whole of Jerusalem. Still, the population is under-served, according to Israel\u2019s oldest civil rights organization ACRI, which says there\u2019s a shortage of 2,200 classrooms in East Jerusalem\u2019s schools. Indeed, it was Palestinian parents who first asked for the Israeli curriculum, according to Lara Mbariki, who is the official in charge of education in East Jerusalem. She dismissed the idea that studying an Israeli curriculum hurt Palestinian students\u2019 sense of identity. \u201cIt\u2019s not just books that affect your sense of identity, but also your upbringing and your immediate environment,\u201d she said. Zakaria Odeh, executive director of the Civic Coalition for Defending the Palestinians\u2019 Rights in Jerusalem, disagreed. \u201cEducation is an act of occupying the mind and thought, he said. \u201cA house or a street that have been demolished could be rebuilt, but if a person is destroyed intellectually and culturally, it is very difficult to restore him.\u201d",

        "article": "If you wish that either Martin Scorsese had directed The Avengers or that The Wire was a little sillier, Marvel and Netflix have good news in the form of Daredevil, the new hour-long drama that, on Friday, dropped 13 episodes suitable for bingeing. The series is created by Drew Goddard, director of The Cabin in the Woods (which he in turn wrote with Avengers writer-director Joss Whedon), and its first episode is very good. Daredevil has a typically silly radioactive Stan Lee origin story, which is the first thing we see: as a little boy, Matt Murdock (Charlie Cox as an adult, Skylar Gaertner as a kid) pushes a man out of the way of a careering truck and ends up splashed in the face with the mysterious goo the truck was carrying, blinding him and also giving him the power, as he grows older, to beat up pretty much anybody. Also to hear, touch, taste and smell better than most non-superheroes to make up for his lack of sight \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t really get explained in the first episode. Related: Meet Daredevil, TV\u2019s emo superhero Fast-forward and he\u2019s done what any sensible person would do, namely take a day job as a lawyer and moonlight as an acrobat who punches people, especially a guy loading a group of screaming young women into a shipping container. Roll credits. The show takes its cues from the work of Sin City creator Frank Miller, who lived in New York in the 70s and 80s and has said in interviews he got beat up with some regularity. New York has changed a lot since the Taxi Driver days and there\u2019s a certain disconnect between the brightly lit Manhattan of today and the Hell\u2019s Kitchen of Miller\u2019s experience (and imagination), but it\u2019s also sort of nice to see a contemporary show about the grimier side of the city. You can only make so many romantic comedies set in Central Park. The show does quite a few things well \u2013 for example, it has a kind of Wong Kar-Wai-lite oversaturation in every shot, so it\u2019s pretty cool looking, as befitting a zillion-dollar Netflix series \u2013 but its primary virtue is a terrific cast, notably Deborah Ann Woll as Dare-amour (sorry) Karen Page and Elden Henson as Matt\u2019s sad-sack partner, Foggy Nelson. Related: California streaming: an inside look at the Netflix 'war room' Freed from the traditional show-it-all-in-the-pilot formula, Goddard does not introduce us to The Kingpin, or Daredevil\u2019s red costume (he\u2019s running around the black outfit fellow nerds will remember from Miller\u2019s and John Romita Jr\u2019s Man Without Fear), or anybody recognizable from the Marvel Universe except the civilian characters and Madame Gao (Wai Ching Ho), a formidable old lady who also runs a creepy drug ring staffed by (we learn in the final montage) blind people and might turn out to be Iron Fist villain The Crane Mother. Iron Fist, by the way, will be joining Daredevil in the Marvel, uh, Digital Streaming Universe. There\u2019s not much to complain about, beyond the show occasionally being a little too nasty \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of lingering on human trafficking and Karen gets objectified and victimized a sight too much; there\u2019s also a scary sequence in which a mobster threatens to murder a prison guard\u2019s college-age daughter in front of him if he doesn\u2019t kill Karen \u2026 and when he fails, the twist is that the daughter finds his bloody body. Superhero comics, everybody! Still, there isn\u2019t enough New York noir on the dial these days and the show has a lot of potential, especially in Cox, who brings a lot of texture to a character who\u2019s been unfairly filed under Miscellaneous Superhero for too long.",

You quickly realize the museum isn't a museum at all \u2014 it's the headquarters of a spy organization that's planning an attack that very night. You've got to find the communications room, stop a launch sequence and transmit a red alert to the public before escaping. It may sound like a pretty extreme way to teach people about the Cold War, but that's what the Diefenbunker Museum in the rural west Ottawa community of Carp and an Ottawa company are hoping to do. Starting in March, the third floor of the former federal government's nuclear attack safehouse will morph into what they're calling the world's largest escape room with the help of Escape Manor, a company that designs scenarios in which groups of people have to find clues and solve puzzles to get out of locked spaces. What exactly does an escape room have to do with teaching lessons about the Cold War? More than you might think, according to the museum's executive director. Henriette Riegel, executive director of the Diefenbunker Museum, says hosting an escape room is a good teachable moment about the Cold War. (CBC News) \"I think the real purpose of the Diefenbunker is to teach young people the lessons of the Cold War; that's conflict resolution, non-violence, peace-building, diplomacy,\" said Henriette Riegel. \"And so what the escape room is asking people to do, it's an interesting and unique way [to do it], but it comes down to the core values of asking people to solve some pretty big problems by working together.\" Billy Rogers, one of the owners of Escape Manor, said the collaboration with the 100,000 square foot museum was a dream come true. Billy Rogers, one of the owners of Escape Manor, says it's been a dream to work in the bunker. (CBC News) \"We always thought it would be neat to do something on a grandiose scale like this,\" he said. \"Just walking into those front doors, we knew right away that it was going to be an awesome opportunity to do something really cool and really unique, not just for Ottawa but for escape rooms in general.\" Diefenbunker escape room spots are filling up but work is underway to add more hours. The sessions take place starting March 10, after the museum closes on Thursday to Sunday nights, with four sessions per night. Groups of 12-14 people are accepted. The Diefenbunker was built from 1959 to 1961 as a place for government and military leaders to go if Canada was under nuclear attack. It was decommissioned in 1994 and reopened as a museum in 1997.",

        "article": "Glenn Ford, the exonerated death-row inmate. (WAFB-TV 9 via AP) In a dissent Monday arguing that the death penalty may be unconstitutional, Supreme Court Justice Stephen G. Breyer, who was joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, pointed to examples of innocent men exonerated after decades on death row. One man they cited \u2014 Glenn Ford \u2014 was exonerated last year after nearly 30 years on death row, and his case drew additional attention earlier this year after the prosecutor who sent him to death row publicly apologized. But just hours before his name was mentioned in a Supreme Court dissent, Ford died of lung cancer. An attorney for Ford said he died shortly after 2 a.m. on Monday, about eight hours before the Supreme Court\u2019s decision on a lethal-injection case landed. The justices highlighted Ford\u2019s story as one that exemplified problems with a death-penalty system they decried as flawed and unreliable. In Ford\u2019s case, they cited the recent admission by Marty Stroud, the prosecutor, that he was \u201cnot as interested in justice as [he] was in winning.\u201d Ford was diagnosed with lung cancer shortly after he was released from the Louisiana State Penitentiary in Angola last year. During the 15 months he was free, he filed lawsuits arguing that he was wrongfully imprisoned and that he was denied necessary medical care after signs emerged suggesting he might have cancer. \u201cAt the time of his release, he was the longest-serving death row inmate in the United States,\u201d William Most, his attorney, said in a statement. \u201cThe state has so far denied Glenn\u2019s petition under Louisiana\u2019s wrongful conviction compensation statute; all Glenn received for his nearly thirty years on death row was $20 for a bus ride home from prison. Shortly after his release, Glenn was diagnosed with lung cancer.\u201d Stroud told The Post in an interview that Ford\u2019s situation \u201cshows why the death penalty is just an abomination.\u201d In that interview earlier this year, the former prosecutor said he was prompted to apologize after he read about Ford\u2019s problems getting the state to pay him. Ford was sentenced to death for killing a watchmaker who ran a jewelry store. And while wrongfully imprisoned inmates in Louisiana can receive up to $250,000 in compensation, the state argued in court filings that he should not be compensated because he sold items that were stolen from the jewelry store. Before he died, attorneys say Ford was able to visit his children in California, where he was raised by his grandmother. He was 65, with nearly half of those years spent behind bars.

        "article": "Million-dollar salaries. Plush hotel suites. Amorous groupies. Pro athletes have it made in the shade, eh? Yes. But there are hazards. Huge tax bills. Incompetent room-service staff. Amorous groupies. Plus, there's the matter of all those other guys on the field or ice who are paid to hurt and/or embarrass you. Of course, some sportsmen don't need any help when it comes to inflicting both injury and insult on themselves. Examples? New York Giants receiver Plaxico Burress accidentally fired a bullet into his own thigh at a Manhattan night club, Chicago Bulls guard Derrick Rose claimed he sliced his arm with a knife he left in bed after paring an apple, and Colorado Avalanche centre Joe Sakic mangled several fingers when he tried to clear out his snowblower. And that's just in the last couple weeks. But don't sweat it, fellas. You're not alone. Here are 10 other athletes who memorably suffered bodily harm at their own hand. The then Tampa Bay Lightning defenceman needed surgery in September 2007 after his skates slipped off a hook in the dressing room and sliced three tendons in his left wrist. You could say Boyle's made a full recovery: He's now the top-scoring blue-liner on a San Jose Sharks team that's off to an NHL-best 22-3-2 start. Chop blocks. Blind-side tackles. Knees to the groin. There are plenty of ways to get hurt in the NFL, but Hanson may be the first player in league history to be injured by a metaphor. When Jacksonville Jaguars coach Jack Del Rio brought a tree stump and an axe into the dressing room in 2003, he meant to show that his struggling team could learn something from the slow and steady technique of a lumberjack. But the demonstration went awry when his punter took an awkward swing and plunged the ax into his left (kicking) leg. The resulting gash earned Hanson a trip to both the emergency room and the injured reserve list for the rest of the season. \"So you're saying I have to take off the shirt first?\" (Win McNamee/Getty Images)Even the most famous athletes aren't exempt from the occasional household chore. Smoltz, whose stellar two-decade career as an Atlanta Braves pitcher should get him into baseball's hall of fame some day, decided back in 1990 that one of his shirts needed ironing. The problem? He was wearing the garment at the time, and the iron scalded his chest. Smoltz has since denied this, but wouldn't you? You wouldn't think a big-league ballplayer would need help working on his tan, but Marty Cordova apparently wasn't satisfied with his skin tone when he visited a California salon in May 2002. Too much time under the lamps burned the Baltimore outfielder's grill, forcing him to sit the next game. You haven't experienced a sore wrist until you try to rock Free Bird on the expert level in Guitar Hero. Zumaya knows. The flame-throwing Detroit Tigers pitcher missed three games of the 2006 American League Championship Series after too much time spent playing the popular video game caused inflammation in his throwing wrist and forearm. Venison isn't just delicious, it's good for you: The leanness and low cholesterol content of the deer meat makes it a healthy alternative to beef. Unless you're Barmes. The Colorado Rockies shortstop broke his collarbone in 2005 when he fell down a flight of stairs while trying to lug a package of it given to him by teammate Todd Helton. \"I also like to relax with the occassional game of golf.\" (Karen Stockman/Associated Press)Football? Dangerous. Hockey? Dangerous. Golf? Not so much, but tell that to Johnson. The first overall pick in the 2006 NHL draft saw his sophomore campaign with the St. Louis Blues end before it began as the result of a freak injury on the links. Don't laugh. The big defenceman tore the ACL and MCL in his right knee last off-season when his foot got caught between the brake and accelerator of his golf cart during a team outing. You know the typical baseball injury report: Henderson (ankle), Rodriguez (elbow), Hill (arachnophobia). Huh? The former Toronto Blue Jay's severe case of spider fright turned all too real when a nightmare about the eight-legged creatures caused him to fall out of bed and tumble through a glass table. The resulting cuts and scrapes landed Hill on the disabled list and earned him a new nickname: Spiderman. Man's best friend? Yeah, right. Barnard was knocked out of action for English soccer team Barnsley in the late 1990s when he slipped on a puddle of urine left by his trusty canine and wrecked his knee. The Denver Broncos wide receiver needed surgery last spring after suffering right forearm lacerations to an artery, a vein, a nerve, two tendons and three muscles. How'd he do that? While wrestling with family members at a Florida resort, Marshall slipped on a McDonald's wrapper, stuck his arm out to break the fall and put it through a TV entertainment centre. Seriously.",

Related: Agony of Chile's dark days continues as murdered poet's wife fights for justice Joan Turner Jara, who is 88, will be one of the key witnesses in the civil case to be heard in Orlando\u2019s federal court against Pedro Pablo Barrientos N\u00fa\u00f1ez, a lieutenant in Chile\u2019s army that toppled the country\u2019s elected socialist president, Salvador Allende, and installed General Pinochet\u2019s brutal 17-year military dictatorship. Barrientos is alleged to have tortured then shot Jara in the head in September 1973 in a locker room at Santiago\u2019s Chile Stadium, where thousands of perceived subversives, activists and communists were rounded up and detained by Pinochet\u2019s forces. Jara\u2019s mutilated body was later found dumped outside the stadium with 44 bullet wounds. Almost 3,100 people were killed during the Pinochet regime, according to Chile\u2019s truth and justice commission, including 1,000 \u201cdisappeared\u201d whose bodies were never found. As well as being a singer, Jara, 40, was a poet, theatre director and professor at the University of Chile and became one of the best-known victims of the oppression instigated by the new ruling military junta. \u201cThis is a powerful moment for all those who have been seeking justice and truth about what happened during the Pinochet coup,\u201d said Dixon Osburn, executive director of the California-based Center for Justice and Accountability that brought the civil action against Barrientos. \u201cIt is also an emotional and almost overpowering moment for V\u00edctor\u2019s widow Joan and the two daughters who have been fighting the fight for justice for the murder of their husband and dad for more than 40 years. \u201cWhat happened in Chile Stadium remains shrouded in mystery but we believe we\u2019re going to be able to draw back that veil by constructing a coherent narrative of what took place there. Our hope is we will present very compelling evidence that this Pinochet officer is liable for the torture and murder of V\u00edctor Jara, or at the very least he aided and abetted.\u201d Now 67, Barrientos fled to the US in 1989 soon after Pinochet lost the first free election in Chile in almost 20 years, and became an American citizen through marriage. He has lived openly in the central Florida city of Deltona since but has not responded to several requests for comment. The civil case, brought under the Alien Tort Statute and Torture Victim Protection Act, marks the first time an officer from the Chilean army will appear as a defendant in a US courtroom to account for Jara\u2019s death. The complaint seeks unspecified damages for torture and extrajudicial killing. A judge in Chile indicted Barrientos and seven other officers for Jara\u2019s murder in 2012 but the case has been slow to progress and the US government has not publicly responded to a formal request from Chile for Barrientos\u2019s extradition. The Orlando trial will feature testimony from about 20 witnesses and is scheduled to last two and a half weeks. It be will determined by a six-person jury in front of Florida district court judge Roy Dalton.",

(The was a set of pink lips that reminded Lovato of lady parts.) Ashley McMullen, who says she was the one to tat up the \"Heart Attack\" artist with the lips when she was 18, took to Instagram recently to slam Lovato for making fun of the design and for not paying or giving her any credit. \"Cool post @ddlovato, thanks for getting the tattoo covered up I did for free that you specifically asked for. Not to mention you didn't even have the courtesy to offer me any money in the first place,\" McMullen wrote on Instagram. (Her account is private, but you can see her post And the fighting words didn't end there. She continued, \"You pissed all over our toilet seat and you made a fool of yourself. What a shame that people look up to you.

(Warning: There is some NSFW language.) Lovato wrote: \"I apologize for making fun of your work.. But... if I were you, I wouldn't claim that one because it looked more like an open vagina (or even a b------- as my 8 year old little sister called it at the time.) I also wouldn't be admitting to the fact that you tattooed a very intoxicated 18 year old on a tour bus without the proper [judgment] that most legit tattoo artists have of saying 'Hmm... This underage kid is wasted, maybe I shouldn't permanently ink a hot pink kiss mark on this girl's wrist....? Oh well... F--- it, she's famous.' \" To wrap up her shade-filled rebuttal, the singer wrote that she takes full responsibility for getting the tattoo \u2013 but made sure to take one final dig. \"Perhaps you could've thought about all of this as a blessing that I forgot everything about you \u2013 that was until you outted yourself for the now internationally infamous 'vagina tattoo.'

        "article": "By Hamid Dabashi Special to CNN Hamid Dabashi is the author of \"Iran: A People Interrupted.\" He is Hagop Kevorkian Professor of Iranian Studies and Comparative Literature at Columbia University in New York. His Web site is http://www.hamiddabashi.com/ Hamid Dabashi says millions of Iranians are now convinced the election was rigged. (CNN) -- In a recent article published both in the Washington Post and the Guardian, Ken Ballen and Patrick Doherty reported that according to their \"nationwide public opinion survey of Iranians three weeks before the vote ... Ahmadinejad [was] leading by a more than 2-to-1 margin -- greater than his actual apparent margin of victory in Friday's election.\" That may or may not be the case, but the abiding wisdom of Aesop's fable of \"The Boy Who Cried Wolf\" or its Persian version, \"The Lying Shepherd,\" has now made any such Monday-morning quarterbacking an academic exercise in futility. The assumption that the government has rigged the election has become a \"social fact\" that millions of Iranians believe. On the basis of that belief, they have put their lives on the line, with reported casualties of dozens injured and at least one, perhaps up to nine, people killed. Chief among the slogans of supporters of presidential challenger Mir Hossein Moussavi is \"With God's help victory is at hand/Death to this deceitful government!\" Such a significant and sizeable segment of Iranian society has lost its trust in this regime in general, and in Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's presidency in particular, that, even if this time around the authorities are telling the truth, they have \"cried wolf\" too many times to be trusted. What we are witnessing is a pent-up anger some 30 years in the making, from the very first inception of the Islamic revolution. The inner contradictions of an \"Islamic republic\" seem finally to have caught up with it. What is unraveling in Iran is not a mere reaction to the result of a presidential election, the tabulation of which may or may not have been accurate. We must place this massive outpouring of pro-Moussavi, anti-Ahmadinejad sentiments among a sizeable segment of Iranian population in a larger context. At least since the presidential election of 1997, which resulted in the presidency of Mohammad Khatami, but with its roots in even deeper sentiments, a vast cross-section of the society has continuously demonstrated its dissatisfaction with the Islamic republic. Soon after the election of President Khatami, in summer 1999, a major student uprising led to yet another massive movement against the government, at a time, in fact, that an exceedingly popular reformist president was leading the country. Immediately after the tragic events of 9/11 in the United States, a sizable group of Iranian youth were rare among Muslim countries in organizing a candlelight vigil commemorating the victims of 9/11 in evident and obvious defiance of their government. Even beyond these sporadic or symbolic events, we have a far more sustained record of inborn and grassroots movements in Iran for human rights, civil rights, and above all, women's rights, which in many instances have taken the very tenets of the Islamic republic to task. It would of course be a misrepresentation of Iranian society to presume that the regime in general or Ahmadinejad's government in particular lacks any degree of popular support or legitimacy. Iran is a society that is deeply fractured along class, social and gender lines. The day after the initial demonstrations against Ahmadinejad, his supporters staged a major rally on his behalf. To be sure, these are state-sponsored, well-orchestrated and carefully staged events, widely broadcast on national TV to fabricate the impression of a far more massive support than he actually enjoys. But nevertheless they do represent a significant segment of the society as well. What we are witnessing since the presidential election might very well emerge as a major civil disobedience movement not just against Ahmadinejad, but in fact for more civil liberties, economic opportunities, human, civil and women's rights -- so far all within the constitutional boundaries of the Islamic republic. But this may in fact extend to target the nondemocratic institutions within the Islamic republic, such as the office of the supreme leader and that of the Guardian Council. The militant supporters of the regime are of course wary of the movement and think it a \"velvet revolution,\" and have warned that they will nip it in the bud. There is already an evident discrepancy between the deep-rooted demands of the movement that this election has unleashed and what Moussavi or the entire reformist movement can actually deliver. In the days and weeks ahead, we will have to wait and see how the dialectic between Moussavi and the volcano he has unleashed will work itself out -- but it is false to think that he is all that this movement wants, or that he is in complete control of the movement, or that the ruling clergy will just pack and leave like the shah did. Moussavi himself has quite a number of nasty skeletons in his closet, from his years as the prime minister during the Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988), with his brutal suppression of dissident movements, ideological purging of the universities, and so on. He and his wife, Zahra Rahnavard, are indeed emerging as widely popular among a significant constituency. But that does not mean that this social unrest is just about him. The only thing that is crystal clear: Out of a population of 72 million and a total of 46 million eligible voters, some 40 million, upward of 80 percent, voted in this election, and a significant segment of them are against the draconian doctrine and policies of the Islamic republic, the economic calamities (double-digit inflation and endemic unemployment) of Ahmadinejad's domestic policies, and his belligerent positions on a range of issues, from the inanities of his denial of the Holocaust to his vacuous and flamboyant positions on a number of regional issues. Neither can the world at large disregard that collective democratic will and have the delusion of a regime change imposed from outside; nor can it be brushed aside by the future president of the Islamic republic, whoever he might be, legitimate or illegitimate. As Grand Ayatollah Montazeri has just said, this movement is challenging the very legitimacy of the Islamic republic. That the elections might or might not have been rigged is now a completely moot and irrelevant question. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Hamid Dabashi.

The company and its current partner in the Jamesport proposal, the New York State Electric and Gas Company, have until Oct. 27 to tell a state siting board whether they plan to proceed with construction of a coal plant, which would have a maximum 800-megawatt capacity. By conservative estimate, a plant of that size would cost more than $1.5 billion to construct. The two partners could, however, elect to build a smaller coal plant on the Long Island Sound site. But Ira Freilicher, Lilco's vice president for public relations, stressed in an interview recently that unless his company found strong backing for a large, downstate power plant among the state's utilities and in the New York State Energy Office, all plans for the Jamesport project would probably be scrapped - at least temporarily. ''Nobody would propose to go ahead with the plant unless there is very substantial interest around the state,'' Mr. Freilicher said. At present, Lilco is beset by massive cost overruns at the still incomplete $2.5 billion Shoreham nuclear plant, a billion-dollar commitment to the Nine Mile II nuclear power plant in Oswego County and wide criticism over sharply rising rates. Now the utility is on the verge of still another planning decision at Jamesport that could have a significant bearing on the company's finances and, in the next decade, on electrical rates. Meanwhile, Lilco is involved in hearings on a state plan to convert the utility's Island Park generating plant to a coal-burning facility. The Nassau County Village Officials Association has announced its opposition to the plan, particularly because conversion of the oil-fired plant would require frequent coal deliveries by train through local communities and because of environmental factors. As for the Jamesport project, the two partners initially applied for state and Federal permission to build two 1,150-megawatt nuclear power plants. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission granted a go-ahead in 1978, but a five-member state siting board turned it down in Jan uary 1980. The decision by the state panel -formally known as the New York State Board on Electrical Generation Siting and the Environment - came after years of opposition by Suffolk County, the Long Island Farm Bureau, the Suffolk County League of Women Voters and antinuclear organizations. The siting board, noting what it called ''regulatory uncertainties'' about licensing nuclear plants in the post-Three Mile Island era, offered as an alternative permission to construct the 800-megawatt coal plant instead at the site. Lilco and its partner have since sought to postpone the deadline for a decision on construction until court challenges to the ruling to allow the coal plant are resolved. Those challenges were made by Suffolk County and the Farm Bureau. But the board insisted this summer that the companies must decide by Oct. 27. ''They asked for one extension after another,'' said William Johnke, a Hempstead architect on the siting board who represents the Long Island public. ''But it comes to a point where there is a great need within the state, for overall energy planning, to have an answer. ''If Jamesport is going to be held in limbo for a long period of time, that means you have no way of making determinations in regard to other applications throughout the state. You don't want to overbuild.'' A draft master plan prepared by the state's Energy Office shows Jamesport on line by 1991, with the full 800-megawatt capacity. But whether Jamesport will have a role in the final master plan will not be decided until legislative and public hearings are held beginning later this fall, after the current deadline. Since state legislators from the Island are almost uniformly critical of Lilco's capital construction programs and their upward pressure on rates, Jamesport's status in the plan appears less than secure. ''Lilco seems to be able to build wherever and whenever they want at whatever cost,'' said Assemblyman John L. Behan, a Montauk Republican. Mr. Behan, whose district covers eastern Long Island, opposes construction of the Jamesport coal plant because he does not believe Lilco proved a need for it and because of what he calls the bungled construction job at the Shoreham nuclear plant. Mr. Behan is chairman of an Assembly minority task force on Long Island utility rates. The panel held a hearing in Riverhead late last month to try to determine the effect on electrical rates when the Shoreham plant goes into service. He said he feared rates could jump as much as 43 percent after the company's projected opening of the plant in 1983, when for the first time the full cost of the project may be charged to customers. The Assemblyman said he wanted an investigation of cost overruns at Shoreham to determine wha t portion could be leveled against Lilco stockholders because of mismanagement. While the Shoreham project remains under scrutiny, he said, Lilco should forget about new construction programs. Mr. Freilicher, however, said that construction at Jamesport - sooner or later - was all but inevitable because ''there are a finite number of licensed sites around the state.''",

        "article": "JERUSALEM \u2014 A bill to dissolve Parliament passed its first reading on Wednesday as Israeli lawmakers began preparations for early elections now scheduled for March 17. The move came a day after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fired his finance minister, Yair Lapid, and his justice minister, Tzipi Livni, the leaders of two centrist parties, effectively breaking up his fractious governing coalition. Mr. Netanyahu had publicly denounced the two ministers and accused them of working to undermine him. Mr. Netanyahu, the leader of the conservative Likud Party, who will be seeking a fourth term in office, called for elections less than two years after the last national ballot and 20 months after the current government was sworn in. Without the two parties led by Mr. Lapid and Ms. Livni, the three other parties in the coalition do not command a majority in Parliament. The long-simmering tensions between members of the departing coalition burst to the fore in recent days, first in a quarrel over a proposed nationality bill that emphasized Israel\u2019s Jewish character more than its democratic principles. Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Lapid, the leader of Yesh Atid, then clashed over the state budget and over a housing initiative championed by Mr. Lapid. In a preview of how the next few months of campaigning might look, the prime minister and the dismissed ministers engaged in strident personal attacks and mutual recrimination. At a televised news conference on Tuesday night, Mr. Netanyahu portrayed Mr. Lapid and Ms. Livni as dark forces who had challenged his policies on Iran and on the Palestinians, and he accused them of plotting a \u201cputsch\u201d against him. Mr. Netanyahu on Wednesday told Likud, \u201cThe elections are over only one issue: who will lead the country.\u201d Speaking to members of her Hatnua party, Ms. Livni described Mr. Netanyahu as \u201cscared\u201d and his verbal assault as \u201chysterical.\u201d \u201cThe time has come to replace him,\u201d she said. Mr. Lapid said that Mr. Netanyahu had lost touch with the people. \u201cI tried to overthrow you? Do you hear yourself? Who sold you that absurdity?\u201d Mr. Lapid said at a televised news conference. The final readings of the law to dissolve Parliament are expected next week.

        "article": "The '90s are over, but the music is still here. The last decade of the 20th century offered everything from grunge to boy bands, but even though some of the best acts aren't getting airplay and attention today like Pearl Jam and the Foo Fighters, they're still cranking out tunes. Here's a trip down memory lane to see where some of the rock bands everyone forgot about are today. 90s TV MEGASTARS: WHERE ARE THEY NOW? Spin Doctors hasn't really been on the airwaves since the 90s, when they rocked with hits like \"Two Princes\" and \"Little Miss Can't Be Wrong,\" but in recent years they've played live shows and created new albums. They haven't been playing together continuously since the 90s, though. In 1999, lead singer Chris Barron suffered from vocal cord paralysis and couldn't sing anymore, according to Rolling Stone. Barron's voice came back, but the band didn't really do much together \u2014 except the occasional live show \u2014 until 2005, according to Consequence of Sound. That year, they released \"Nice Talking to Me\" and then in 2013 they released \"If the River Was Whiskey.\" Currently, their site doesn't list any upcoming tour dates but they've been playing some shows individually, according to their Facebook page. NICKELODEON STARS OF THE 90S: WHERE ARE THEY NOW? Best known for \u201cAll For You,\u201d the band named after a nun first formed in the 90s. Today \u2014 more than two decades later \u2014 they\u2019re still together and releasing music. In February, they put out a country album titled \u201cLighter in the Dark.\u201d For a couple years, the lead singer also ran motivational workshops and then in 2012 opened a coffee shop in Florida. \u201cIt\u2019s a coffeehouse, where we also happen to develop the workshops for professional and personal growth,\u201d lead singer Ken Block told The Gainesville Sun. The band best known for \"Runaway Train\" first formed in the early 80s but didn't have a mainstream breakthrough until 1992's album \"Grave Dancers Union.\" 90S PLAYBOY PLAYMATES: WHERE ARE THEY NOW? They recorded other albums in the 90s, but as the popularity of grunge waned, they took a hiatus. Then, the group's bassist, Karl Mueller, died of throat cancer in 2005, according toRolling Stone. The remaining members replaced him with former Guns N'Roses bassist Tommy Stinson and went on to release an album the following year. Their next release was in 2012, though just a few months after the album dropped, guitarist and co-founder John Murphy announced his retirement, according to themusic mag. The band has soldiered on, though, and on March 18 they announced a new album release onFacebook. Best known for \"No Rain\" \u2014 and the video with the dancing girl in the bee costume \u2014 the grunge rock group effectively disbanded when lead singer Shannon Hoon overdosed and died in 1995. For about a decade, the remaining members did not continue their music-making efforts. Then, the four remaining members found a new lead singer \u2014 Travis Warren \u2014 and got together to make an album, as they explained to Billboard in a 2006 interview. According to the band's site, they took a brief hiatus in 2009 but later started touring again, most recently doing an Australian tour in 2015. Their site says the band \u201ccontinues to play a handful of special shows each year.\u201d The Irish rock band ruled the airwaves at alternative stations throughout the 90s. They boasted a slew of hits, including \"Zombie,\" \"Salvation\" and \"Linger.\" After a many year hiatus, the band reunited andreleased \"Roses\" in 2012. The album didn't achieve the popularity of their earlier hits. Now, lead singer Dolores O'Riordan is set to release an album with The Smiths' bassist Andy Rourke, according to Rolling Stone. The 10-track \"Science Agrees\" drops on May 27. Best known for the bar song/graduation staple \"Closing Time,\" Semisonic's last studio album was in 2001. The following year, they released a live album, according to their website. Since then, they've pursued individual projects, both musical and otherwise. Drummer Jacob Slichter released a book titled \"So You Want to Be a Rock'N'Roll Star,\" while bass player John Munson joined a jazz trio called The New Standards. Blur was first founded in the late 80s, but the Brit band didn't make it big stateside until the mid-90s. Later, one of their founding members, Graham Coxon, left the band for a time but they went on to release their seventh album anyway in 2003, according to the band's site. In 2009, Coxon rejoined the band and they did a U.K. tour. In 2012, they released a box compilation and last year they released a new album, \"The Magic Whip.\" Singer Damon Albarn, however, has been more successful on his own. In the late 90s, Albarn formed Gorillaz, the band responsible for hits like \u201cClint Eastwood\u201d and \u201cFeel Good Inc.\u201d The British rock band known for \"Everything Zen\" and \"Glycerine\" dominated the 90s but, according to Rolling Stone, they took a hiatus starting in 2001. More than a decade later, the group reunited and released an album titled \"The Sea of Memories\" in 2011 and in 2014 they released \"Man on the Run.\" Right now, they have a number of U.S. tour dates slated for the spring and summer, according to their website. The band's lead singer has also been in the news of late, but not so much for his music-making. In the early 2000s, just after the band break-up, frontman Gavin Rossdale married No Doubt's Gwen Stefani \u2014 but their recent divorce was all over the news, with allegations that the Bush rocker cheated with the couple's nanny. Though they formed in the mid-90s, Wheatus is pretty much only known for \"Teenage Dirtbag,\" released in 2000. They haven't been on the airwaves in more than a decade, but they do still play together and, according to their rathersparse website, they still make music. Since their heyday, they've had a lot of changes to their line-up and they've released a few albums including, most recently, 2013's \"The Valentine LP.\" They still dolive shows, too \u2014 so if you want proof that the whiny rockers still exist, there's a real possibility.",

        "article": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Hillary Clinton spent Tuesday courting female voters in New York \u2014 a must-win state for her White House hopes \u2014 and bypassed Wisconsin on its primary day. Clinton appeared on TV\u2019s \u201cThe View,\u201d where she disclosed her \u201ccelebrity crush\u201d on actor George Clooney, who\u2019ll be staging a big-ticket fund-raiser for her next week. Later in Brooklyn, she joined New York City First Lady Chirlane McCray to rally women on Clinton\u2019s history-making presidential run. \u201cWe still have a long way to go before we can honestly say to our daughters, \u2018Yes, you can be anything you want to be including president,\u2019 \u201d Clinton said. She was joined by two women whose loved ones were killed by police in the city \u2014 Nicole Bell, \u00adfianc\u00e9e of Sean Bell, who died in 2006, and Gwen Carr, mother of Eric Garner, who died in 2014. \u201cWe tried all the men, so let\u2019s try a woman,\u201d Carr told the crowd at Medgar Evers College in Crown Heights. The event was billed as a town hall. But when Clinton ended her stump speech, a DJ blasted walk-off music and off she went. That upset attendee Reva Thomas, 42, who was there to ask Clinton about paid medical leave. \u201cI thought the town-hall meeting would have given audience members the chance to have a dialog with her and have her address issues . . . I don\u2019t know what happened,\u201d she said. Meanwhile, Democratic rival Bernie Sanders pledged to fight on to the party convention in late July. \u201cWhen we arrive at the convention, it will be an open convention, likely with neither candidate having a majority of pledged delegates,\u201d Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver said on CNN. Going into Tuesday\u2019s primary, Sanders had 1,011 delegates to Clinton\u2019s 1,712, with 2,383 needed to win the nomination. Although she\u2019s firmly pro-choice, Clinton reached out to pro-life women by saying they, too, can be feminists. \u201cI respect the opinions and \u00adbeliefs of every woman,\u201d she said on \u201cThe View.\u201d \u201cThe reason why being pro-choice is the right way to go is \u00adbecause it is a choice and hopefully a choice that is rooted in the thoughtfulness and the care that women bring to this decision. So of course you can be a feminist and be pro-life.\u201d Additional reporting by Priscilla DeGregory and Jennifer Bain",

        "article": "In its 40 year history, \u201cSNL\u201d has featured thousands of musical acts. While many have been notable, these, more than any, have made tongues wag, throats gag or hearts soar. Like the Kennedy assassination, everyone remembers exactly where they were when they saw Sinead pull her Pope-ripping stunt. Right before performing Bob Marley's song \"War,\" the bald star glared at the camera, tore apart a photo of John Paul II and sneered \"fight the real enemy.\" According to eyewitnesses, the studio audience didn't boo or laugh. Instead they reacted like the audience at the end of the first act of \"Springtime for Hitler\" in \"The Producers\u201d: with total shock. The next day\u2019s Daily News front page screamed \u201cHoly Terror.\u201d The following Saturday, musical guest Madonna paused after her song \"Bad Girl,\" ripped a picture of notorious Long Island cad Joey Buttafuoco and yelled her own \"fight the real enemy\" mantra. Two weeks after the initial event, O'Connor herself appeared at the 30th anniversary tribute to Bob Dylan at The Garden, where the crowd greeted her with vicious catcalls. Sinead remained a controversial figure until years later, when she explained that she meant her baffling behavior as a protest against sexual abuse within the church. That issue wasn't part of the public conversation back in '92. But, by the new millennium, the church admitted the depth of the problem and O'Connor came out looking like a retroactive saint. Simpson had the meltdown of all time during her \u201cSNL\u201d appearance. The teen-pop singer managed to get through her first song (\"Pieces of Me\"). But just before her second \u2014 \"Autobiography\" \u2014 a tape of the vocal from the previous number blared out, clueing the audience into the fact they were witnessing a lip-synch. Faced with a snickering crowd, a red-faced Simpson started to do a nervous jig, then fled the stage. Two days later, she blamed it on a bout of acid reflux, which, she said, prompted her to use an automated guide vocal. Lorne Michaels said he was unaware of the scheme and, had he been, he would have forbade it. Later, the singer admitted to an interviewer, \"I made a complete fool of myself.\" Right at the height of their \"Some Girls\" comeback, The Stones made headlines when Mick Jagger stuck out his ample tongue and licked the face of guitarist Ron Wood during the song \"Respectable.\" Back in those homophobic days, it drew \u201cewws\u201d of outrage. Today, a move like that would bring only titters. One month after the release of Costello's revelatory debut, \"My Aim is True,\" \u201cSNL\u201d invited him to play. He wasn't their first choice. They wanted The Sex Pistols, who couldn't make it. For his showcase, 23-year-old Costello was meant to play \"Less Than Zero,\" whose lyrics present a critique of a British politician. But seconds after starting the song, Elvis cut the piece short, announcing \"I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen, but there's no reason to do this song here.\" He and his band, The Attractions, then launched into \"Radio Radio, a song that points a judgmental finger at corporate control of the airwaves. Feeling disrespected, producer Lorne Michaels flashed Costello the middle finger and banned him from the show for life. The ban wound up lasting 12 years. Many mainstream viewers had never heard of Internet sensation Lana Del Rey when she made her national television debut on \u201cSNL.\u201d But her pitchy, wavering and generally zombie-fied performance of \"Video Games\" prompted instant Internet trolling. Actress Juliette Lewis tweeted, \"Wow, watching this 'singer' on \u201cSNL\u201d is like watching a 12 year old in their bedroom when they're pretending to sing and perform.\" Perez Hilton implored that we \"#DontBuyTheHype.\" Even staid NBC News anchor Brian Williams later questioned whether she had any talent at all. Though considered at the time to be a career-killing performance, Del Rey went on to sell millions of albums and to attract an especially rabid fan base. Right as the smell of teen spirit wafted over the country, its finest avatars played their first network TV show. This roaring showcase further cemented Nirvana's riffs as the soundtrack for an emerging generation. New York hipsters may have known her well by then, but Smith's \u201cSNL\u201d performance of the song \"Gloria\" gave the revolutionary star the chance to shove her incendiary poetry, masturbatory dance moves and wild singing down the throats of the heartland. This wins the awkward award. Belushi, who had long satirized Cocker's flailing stage moves, appeared with the star himself on \"Feelin' Alright,\" creating spasms in stereo. Clearly, Cocker got the joke but, due to his famous alcoholism of the time, Belushi's out-of-control motions hit a little too close to home. Bridging their early, herky-jerky sound, with their later sensual one, The Talking Heads offered a perfectly unsettling take on Al Green's classic song, \"Take Me To The River.\". As Tina Weymouth's bass lines crawled, proud geek David Byrne flashed America his trademark psychotic stare. It's hard to remember, but in its heyday, \u201cSNL\u201d didn't just hire musicians at the top of the charts. Instead, it acted like a curator, giving sounds at the margin the broader airing they deserved. Unfortunately, the famously drunken Replacements brought a bit too much edge (and God knows what else) to their shambolic performance of \"Bastards of Young\" on \u201cSNL.\u201d They fumbled around, missed vocal cues and generally acted like brats. Even so, their memorably \"loose\" performance gave the '80s most underappreciated rock band a cherished national shot.",

        "article": "If you want to understand the real nature of the current tussle between the Senate and the CIA, with Dianne Feinstein and now Harry Reid denouncing John Brennan and Langley for essentially spying on the Senate's intelligence oversight committee, all you really need to do is watch a few reruns of The Sopranos. Yes, Tony and various other members of the different mafia factions often hated each other. And, yes, they were constantly looking for ways to muscle in, siphon off profits and deny opportunities to the other gangs. But even in the midst of a mob war, there were still rules. When Brooklyn boss Phil Leotardo goes too far, for example, his own people finger him to Tony for execution. \"Families don't get touched,\" Tony explains to his wife. \"You know that.\" Or take The Godfather: remember when Tom Hagen explains to Michael Corleone why they can't kill McCluskey? \"Nobody has ever gunned down a New York police captain before,\" Hagen says. \"It would be disastrous. All the other five families would turn against you. The Corleone family would be outcast. Even the old man's political protection would run for cover.\" If you want to understand a fight, it's as important to understand what's not happening as what is. So, yes, Feinstein, Brennan and Reid are throwing punches, and cursing, and scratching and biting. But is anyone trying to gauge out an eye? Has anyone pulled a weapon? Are the combatants trying to kill \u2013 or merely to wound? Why does Feinstein, whose oversight committee has reviewed a reported six million documents and produced a 6,300-page report on CIA practices Feinstein calls \"brutal\" and \"horrible\" and \"un-American\", insist on referring merely to a CIA \"interrogation\" program rather than calling it a torture program, which is what the program actually was? Why doesn't she declassify the report simply by introducing it into Senate proceedings pursuant to the Constitution's Speech or Debate clause? And why would she claim \"the CIA's search may also have violated the Fourth Amendment, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, as well as Executive Order 12333, which prohibits the CIA from conducting domestic searches or surveillance [and] may well have violated the separation of powers principles embodied in the United States Constitution\" \u2026 and then ask for nothing more than \"an apology and a recognition that this CIA search of computers used by its oversight committee was inappropriate\"? All these grave charges, and all Feinstein wants for the CIA spying on the Senate is an apology? Then have a look at Reid's two new missives from late last week \u2013 his language couldn't be more restrained. Like Feinstein, he's careful never to say a word as problematic as \"torture\". And nowhere does he demand a criminal investigation, instead merely asking for Eric Holder's \"support\". The only investigation that seems to really interest the Senate majority leader is a limited exercise he can manage himself: that the Senate's sergeant-at-arms conduct a forensic examination of those Senate computers the CIA seems to have searched. An apology? The sergeant-at-arms? A little support from the Justice Department? Does any of this sound like mortal combat? It's more like the familiar unwritten rule of the mob: admit you crossed a line, back off, and we'll get back to business. It all makes an unfortunate sort of sense, because asocial violence typically occurs between individuals, not within systems. And Brennan, Feinstein and Reid \u2013 despite whatever personal loathing they might feel for each other and whatever personal prerogatives might be at stake \u2013 are acutely aware that their power depends on their continued good standing within the system. \"There's a limit,\" Tony tells Phil. \"Point where business bleeds into other shit. Feelings make things financially unfeasible.\" So, yes, they'll fight, but our Washington gangsters will fight within the implicitly understood rules. And those rules, apparently, include not calling torture torture, not declassifying a report on torture, and not demanding an actual investigation for acts of grave criminality. Instead, we get a lot of pushing and posturing, combined with pleas for apologies and \"resolutions\". This isn't to say it's impossible the fight could spin out of control and turn into something more like combat. If Brennan is too stupid or too arrogant to back down, maybe Feinstein will escalate by having a staffer start leaking details of the torture report. (It's possible this is already happening.) At which point, maybe Brennan will direct his people to come up with additional ways of trying to intimidate the Senate's staff. Maybe at some point, someone will feel desperate enough to start revealing where the bodies are really buried. After all, Michael Corleone did kill that police captain \u2013 but only because the survival of his own family depended on it. And the Corleones did pay a huge price, with the other four families turning against them and Michael's own brother slain. Violating the framework of the system \u2013 the system that holds the foundation of your own power \u2013 is an extremely risky thing to do. Well, we can hope. After all, it would be deeply beneficial to the country \u2013 indeed, to the world \u2013 if a few of America's oligarch's became so enraged at each other that they started publicly tearing into each other in ways that would expose and undermine the insidious system that sustains them. But more likely Feinstein, Brennan and Reid will remember how much they profit from the system, and back off before they do anything to damage it. Maybe like one of those ridiculous Sopranos sit-downs. Most of the time, profits \u2013 and cooler heads \u2013 prevail. \"I'm willin' to move forward,\" as Tony would say. \"Let the past be bygones.\"",

That claim came in a motion filed by a lawyer representing a defendant in the sprawling federal case in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. Attorney Frank Quintero Jr. asked the court to compel prosecutors and Major League Baseball to comply with subpoenas before the Feb. 9, 2015, trial of his client, Lazaro Collazo, in order to help him prepare Collazo\u2019s defense. Quintero included voluminous discovery material in his motion, and asked why Rodriguez, who received only limited immunity in the case, should get off scott free while Collazo and two other defendants, including A-Rod\u2019s cousin, Yuri Sucart, are headed to trial. Quintero further pointed out that statements made by A-Rod\u2019s former lawyer, Joseph Tacopina, indicate that \u201canother, yet undisclosed non-prosecution agreement exists (or communications to that effect) with Mr. Rodriguez and/or his counsel, as well as with other government witnesses.\u201d The court documents include Tacopina\u2019s recent interview for New York magazine titled, \u201cA-Rod\u2019s Lawyer Declares Victory,\u201d as evidence of a possible additional agreement. Tacopina references A-Rod\u2019s immunity agreement in the article and says, \u201cHe didn\u2019t get indicted. . . . It\u2019s over. Game. Set. Match.\u201d According to Quintero, Tacopina\u2019s statements show that Rodriguez has received \u201cpromises of non-prosecution by the Government,\u201d since a limited-use agreement does not prevent the government from prosecuting a witness who lied to agents or if further evidence of criminal activity was discovered by investigators. \u201cMr. Tacopina, who served as a prosecutor prior to practicing as a criminal defense attorney, would be aware that the immunity agreement conveyed to Mr. Rodriguez would not bar prosecution against his client under certain circumstances,\u201d wrote Quintero, \u201csuch as for providing false information or information derived from other investigations/witnesses.\u201d The U.S. Attorney intends to \u201ctake no action against Mr. Rodriguez, instead making it known that they intend to rely on his testimony at trial,\u201d Quintero wrote, adding that any additional immunity agreement would be subject to disclosure. Some of the material in Quintero\u2019s motion has already been reported by media outlets, including the Daily News, but much of it reveals the gritty details of the most extensive drug investigation in baseball history. Attached to the motion are more than a dozen exhibits, including a DEA agent\u2019s affidavit, proffer agreements and testimony transcripts from Rodriguez\u2019s 2013 arbitration hearing, where the Yankee slugger fought unsuccessfully to escape a lengthy Biogenesis doping ban handed down by MLB commissioner Bud Selig. Quintero\u2019s filing asks the court to compel MLB and the government to provide additional documents he says go to the heart of Collazo\u2019s defense and explain any relationship between baseball and federal investigators. MLB has acknowledged responding to the government\u2019s subpoenas for information gathered in baseball\u2019s own investigation into Biogenesis but has said repeatedly that it got no help from the feds in return. In fact, MLB had to file a lawsuit in Florida state court in March of 2013 to compel Bosch and other Biogenesis defendants to provide evidence to help its investigation. \u201cMLB\u2019s involvement in this cause did not cease after jumpstarting the DEA\u2019s investigation,\u201d Quintero wrote. \u201cInstead, MLB has presumably steered, impeded and/or controlled the DEA\u2019s investigation and the USAO\u2019s prosecution thereafter.\u201d \u201cWe have no comment beyond there is absolutely no truth to those claims,\u201d an MLB spokesman told the Daily News. Thursday\u2019s filing also includes testimony by Bosch\u2019s former attorney, Susy Ribero-Ayala, during the Rodriguez appeal of his MLB suspension last year. Ribero-Ayala testified that she met with A-Rod and his lawyers Roy Black and Jared Lopez on Jan. 29, 2013, the day the Miami New Times posted documents linking the disgraced Yankee and other players to Bosch\u2019s Biogenesis clinic. Rodriguez and his lawyers never denied the explosive allegations in the South Florida weekly paper during that meeting, Ribero-Ayala testified. But Rodriguez insisted they issue statements denying the steroid accusations, even though Ribero-Ayala was wary of issuing a statement denying Rodriguez and Bosch had been involved with performance-enhancing drugs. \u201cI think I said something about the fact that Lance Armstrong denied allegations, and it didn\u2019t work out so well for him,\u201d Ribero-Ayala testified, referring to the banned cyclist who had acknowledged in January of 2013, during a televised interview with Oprah Winfrey, that he had lied for years about his PED use. Ribero-Ayala also testified that during that meeting with A-Rod, Black and Lopez, that Rodriguez was the most vocal of the group, suggesting Ribero-Ayala release a statement on behalf of Bosch. \u201cIt was mainly Mr. Rodriguez,\u201d she testified. According to the exhibit, Ayala-Ribero first began representing Bosch on Jan. 27, 2013 \u2014 the day after the Daily News published a story saying federal agents and MLB were investigating Bosch and Rodriguez for their alleged involvement with performance-enhancing drugs. The exhibits that accompany Thursday\u2019s motion also include transcripts of the testimony that incoming MLB commissioner Rob Manfred (then baseball\u2019s COO) gave on Oct. 17, 2013, when he described how MLB investigators came to purchase Biogenesis records. \u201cThere was an individual who called us,\u201d Manfred said. \u201cA gentleman by the name of Bobby \u2014 he identified himself as Bobby from Boca. . . . We subsequently learned through investigation that the gentleman\u2019s name was Gary Jones. And we eventually bought documents from Gary Jones.\u201d Jones was later arrested for his involvement in a separate drug-dealing scheme and recently pleaded guilty to federal drug charges. In another exhibit, an affidavit signed by DEA agent Gene Grafenstein, there are details of a sizeable drug purchase made by a DEA confidential source on Dec. 14, 2012, and that the source made the purchase from Sucart and Carlos Acevedo, another Biogenesis defendant. \u201cThe CS (confidential source) advised Sucart that the CS needed to purchase PES (performance-enhancing substances) in large quantities and that some of the intended recipients of the PES were high school athletes,\u201d reads the DEA affidavit.",

        "article": "Euro-zone governments held back part of a big scheduled loan payment in a warning shot to Greece Wednesday, as outside pressure mounted on the country's politicians to pull together a pro-euro coalition to take charge of the government. Greece's euro-zone partners agreed to release only \u20ac4.2 billion ($5.5 billion) in previously agreed financing, to be paid out Thursday, holding back \u20ac1 billion at least until June. That would be paid only if Greece keeps to pledges it made to secure a bailout. Some officials at the IMF said the discussions on withholding part of the tranche were intended perhaps to pressure Athens to form a bailout-backing coalition government, rather than a sincere threat to cancel the payment. With Athens in political turmoil after a fractured result in weekend elections, and a new vote likely by June, German politicians cautioned that further aid could be withdrawn if Greece abandons austerity targets\u2014even if that pushes the country from the bloc. \"If Greece ends the reform process it has undertaken, then I can't see that the respective tranches [of aid] can be paid out,\" German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said. Germany's finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, added that \"if Greece does not decide to stay in the euro zone we can't force them to stay in it.\" Thursday's payment is needed for Greece to pay \u20ac3.3 billion it owes the European Central Bank next week. The aid was agreed in March by euro-zone governments as part of Greece's \u20ac130 billion second bailout program. The decision to release only part of the funding followed what one official called a \"lively\" two-hour discussion among euro-zone officials. Officials said Germany and Finland in particular were concerned about releasing more funds to Greece, where politicians who fared well in Sunday's elections were issuing statements repudiating Athens's deals with the euro zone and the International Monetary Fund. A surge in anti-austerity sentiment has fed support for fringe parties and is seen as a threat to the bailout Greece negotiated. On Wednesday, the second-place finisher in the elections\u2014the radical-left Syriza coalition\u2014 was unable to broker a deal with the other two top finishers, the Socialist Pasok party and the conservative New Democracy party, to form a government. Syriza leader Alexis Tsipras has stuck to campaign promises to tear up loan agreements that many Greeks believe have deepened the recession and sent joblessness spiraling higher, and says that because more than 60% of Greek voters backed anti-austerity parties, the latest bailout pact is voided. He was expected to send a letter to that effect late Wednesday to top officials of the European Commission and European Central Bank. Renewed doubt for Greece's future financing sent a scare through European financial markets. The euro fell sharply as investors considered the possibility that Greece would default on its debt and leave the euro zone. A ballot box was emptied in Athens With talks reaching no resolution Wednesday, the Pasok party, which came in third in Sunday's vote, will make a last stab at building a coalition. But few expect a breakthrough and many observers say parties are positioning themselves for another election in June. \"It doesn't look like there is any other solution apart from elections,\" one Syriza official said. The next round is shaping up to be a showdown between Mr. Tsipras and New Democracy leader Antonis Samaras, who is expected to make the election a last stand for Greece staying in the euro bloc. \"Tsipras is trying to create a broad left movement to contest the next elections,\" said Anthony Livanios, a political-risk consultant. \"But Samaras will turn the elections into a de facto referendum on the euro.\" Mr. Samaras won the most seats on Sunday but gave up trying to form a new government after six hours on Monday, though he had three days for the task under Greek law. A longtime critic of the austerity measures, Mr. Samaras has nonetheless reluctantly backed the latest bailout in a bid to keep Greece in the euro zone. Internal surveys by the conservative and Socialist parties say Syriza continues to make strong gains and is now the country's most popular party at around 25% of the vote. But Mr. Samaras is banking that some voters\u2014after registered a protest in the first elections\u2014will turn away from Syriza's calls to annul the loan deal.

        "article": "Autodesk, a quirky software start-up in Marin County, north of San Francisco, rose to prominence in the early 1980s because of AutoCAD, its computer-aided design program that was intended for use on personal computers. Over the next decade, AutoCAD became the standard design tool for architects and engineers. This week at the TED conference in Long Beach, Calif., the company will take the first public step toward translating its computer design approach, which has since spilled over from Hollywood to the Maker movement, into the emerging nanoscale world of synthetic biology and materials. For the last two years, a small group of software engineers and molecular biologists have been developing a software system for designing at the molecular level at the company\u2019s research laboratory in downtown San Francisco. At the TED conference, Autodesk will introduce \u201cProject Cyborg,\u201d a Web-based software platform for delivering a range of services like molecular modeling and simulation. The company has quietly begun working with a small group of molecular biologists in the last year. It has not announced when it will commercialize the technology, but it envisions that scientists, engineers and even students and \u201ccitizen scientists\u201d will soon be able to use the system on individual projects. There are still many open questions that nanotechnology needs to surmount, ranging from viability to safety. Autodesk executives and the designers of Project Cyborg believe, however, that they can recreate the thriving commercial ecosystems that the company has now evolved in engineering design at a Lilliputian scale. They foresee nanorobots that will be able to attack cancers and other diseases and a new world of molecular materials, as well as a visualization system for an entire universe beyond the range of the unaided human eye. \u201cPeople are only now being introduced to the fact that this form of science is in fact design, and it has the same paradigms and patterns as designing a factory or designing a car, with different nouns and verbs,\u201d said Jeff Kowalski, Autodesk\u2019s chief technology officer. \u201cThat\u2019s our objective \u2013 to understand how to take 30 years of technology to transform how design is done in the inert world and empower those who are designing in the living world.\u201d The company will introduce its new nanodesign software vision in two talks to be given by scientists who have been working with the Autodesk research lab. One will be delivered by Skylar Tibbits, an M.I.T. architect and computer scientist who is to discuss biomolecular self-assembly on Tuesday. Jessica Green, a University of Oregon ecologist, is to speak on Thursday about design at the molecular scale. Autodesk took its first commercial step into biological design last year with a partnership with Organovo Holdings, a San Diego start-up that aims to manufacture human tissues and organs. Autodesk software will be used to control a so-called bioprinter being developed by Organovo. It will initially have pharmaceutical testing applications. Autodesk is not alone in seeking to build nanoscale design tools, nor the first to try to commercialize molecular design. Thomas Knight, an M.I.T electrical engineer, introduced the concept of biobricks in 2003. The idea has been to create a library of standard biological parts derived from specific DNA sequences. Ideally they would share a common \u201cinterface,\u201d making it possible to use them to construct new biological systems. A striking example of the potential of molecular design was announced in February 2012 by the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard. Two scientists at the institute designed a robotic device from DNA that was intended to seek out specific cells and deliver anticancer therapeutics with remarkable precision. The nanoscale robot is shaped like a clamshell and designed to open when it reaches its target, releasing a specific molecule. The Autodesk researchers acknowledge they are far from being able to sell commercially robust engineering tools for the nano world. \u201cRight now we don\u2019t even have the notion of digital prototyping in any mature way in biology,\u201d said Carlos Olguin, head of the Autodesk Bio/Nano/Programmable Matter Group. \u201cPeople really do all of this by trial and error.\u201d But the company is placing a significant bet that that will not always be the case. If Autodesk is right, it will be a tremendous vindication for K. Eric Drexler, an M.I.T.-trained engineer who in the 1970s began forecasting the emergence of a world engineered by nanoscale machines.",

        "article": "The Federal Reserve's view on the economy halted a two-day losing streak in the markets Wednesday as investors felt comfortable that interest rates will remain near historic lows for some time. The good news on lending, however, was tempered by a bleak report on housing. Bank shares led the advance after Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke told Congress in his semiannual report to legislators that rates will remain low for an extended period though the economy shows continued signs of a rebound after the financial crisis and recession. Shares of Citigroup ( C - news - people ) and Bank of America ( BAC - news - people ) were among the most heavily traded during the session, with the big banks up 3% and 2.5%, respectively. Toll Brothers ( TOL - news - people ) and other home builders suffered minor declines after a report said new home sales unexpectedly dropped in January when analysts had predicted a slight increase. Toll fell 0.6% even though the firm said its quarterly loss was narrower than expected. The major indexes started off the day with modest gains but jumped higher after Bernanke's comments to end near their session highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 92 points, or 0.9%, to 10,374 and the S&P 500 rose 11 points, or 1%, to 1,105. The Nasdaq finished with a gain of 22 points, or 1%, to close at 2,236. H&R Block ( HRB - news - people ) had bad news for investors, telling them a slow start to the tax season will lead the tax preparer to miss its forecasts for the year. (See \"Taxing Season For H&R Block\") J.M. Smucker ( SJM - news - people ) issued a forecast that fell short of Wall Street analysts' hopes. Shares fell 2.4%. (See \"Folgers Jolts Smucker's Profits, But Forecast Lacks Energy\") Word of continued low lending rates hurt the U.S. dollar as investors sought out higher-yielding currencies. That, in turn, boosted commodities for the day, with crude oil topping $80 a barrel. Chevron ( CVX - news - people ) saw some benefit, with shares up 0.4% while Exxon Mobil ( XOM - news - people ) rose 0.9% and ConocoPhillips ( COP - news - people ) jumped 1%. Toyota Motor ( TM - news - people ) got a big lift after its chief testified before the House.

        "article": "In New York, just getting to the airport is an odyssey unto itself. According to a recent study, we endure the worst airport commutes of any major city. If only there was a way to, well, fly to the airport. Earlier this month, ride-sharing service Gotham Air launched with an intriguing offer: helicopter flights to JFK for $99. The price, currently at $149, rises to $219 on Monday. The pitch: Travel from Manhattan to Newark Liberty Airport or JFK in six minutes. So how does a chopper to JFK compare to a taxi or train? I tried all three options, starting each journey with a noontime departure from the information kiosk at Grand Central and ending at a Terminal 5 ticket kiosk. Of the three, the helicopter ride was by far the biggest thrill. Arriving at the Downtown Manhattan Heliport on Pier 6, I was whisked into the VIP room where passengers can enjoy weird space art or fortify themselves for the six-minute journey with free coffee and muffins. I was joined by three passengers\u2014a recent finance grad and two young startup mavens. After receiving instructions from the ground crew (\u201cIf you\u2019re feeling sick just tell the pilot!\u201d), we squished into the cabin of a Bell 407 and donned noise-canceling headphones equipped with mics so we could chat. I learned about funding structures, that all investment bankers are lemmings, and that while the blocks around Madison Square Park are still pocked with beauty parlors, property investors can relax, knowing these tacky shops can\u2019t hang on for long. Speeding at 150 miles an hour, we swept over Governors Island and Prospect Park. The guys went bananas taking selfies and shots out the window. It was over too soon. The taxi offered its own barrage of amusements. The chatty cabby invited me to his homeland and complimented my profession: \u201cYou must have brain a lot of stuff inside!\u201d The radio blared the news while the taxi TV warned against drinking and driving. But for sheer entertainment, nothing beats the subway. Transferring from the number 4 train to the A train to JFK\u2019s AirTrain, I met a friendly tourist from Seattle and a musician playing a metal pan drum shaped like a turtle. \u201cPeople ask me what\u2019s inside,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing but magic and unicorn tears.\u201d A man clutching a tattered bible spat a giant loogie. A woman practicing sign language suddenly turned to me and sang, \u201cAll By Myself.\u201d A student brandishing a Red Bull shouted to his friends across the aisle, \u201cI have to be different! I have to be creative! I don\u2019t care!\u201d Gotham Air CEO Tim Hayes, who used to arrange travel for bands like U2 and the Ramones, and later became a producer for Good Morning America, says he got the idea for his service when he realized that many choppers and pilots are idle most of the day. Now he sells this unused inventory at rates well below the $2,000 or so it can cost to charter a private helicopter. He expects the service will appeal to business travelers who can expense the fare and vacationers looking for a fun way to launch their trip. These folks may be disappointed if they\u2019re looking for the ultimate in convenience. Taking a helicopter, it turns out, is a bit complicated. Travel to the heliport required a $20 cab ride from Grand Central. Upon landing at JFK\u2019s private aviation tarmac, customers board a free shuttle to their terminal. But this certainly beats the train. While the public-transportation option costs just $7.50, it\u2019s the schlep to end all schleps, involving multiple transfers, 10 flights of stairs and 27 train stops. For sheer ease, the taxi wins. You can\u2019t beat the convenience of hailing a ride at 42nd Street that drops you right at your terminal. And the price is reasonable. I paid the $52 flat fare, plus $6 in taxes and tolls and a $12 tip. Another chopper drawback: baggage restrictions. For now, Gotham Air has a 25-pound limit. A taxi, meanwhile, offers a spacious trunk. And I\u2019ve seen New Yorkers use the subway to transport everything from shopping carts to major appliances. Of course, the real point of a helicopter is saving time. How does Gotham Air compare? The train, no surprise, was the worst performer. Kiosk to kiosk, the journey took 1 hour and 40 minutes\u2014longer than a flight to Nova Scotia. The chopper trip, meanwhile, took just under 8 minutes. But that doesn\u2019t account for the taxi and shuttle rides. Actual travel time point-to-point: 52 minutes. Mr. Hayes says while my experience was within the norm, the total journey should take about 42 minutes under ideal conditions. But the upshot remains the same. Yes, my humble taxi beat the chopper. Kiosk to kiosk, the cab got me to JFK in 32 minutes flat. I got lucky with light traffic, of course. The trip often takes 45 minutes to an hour. But even then, we\u2019re still talking speeds rivaling the helicopter\u2014for a fraction of the price. It\u2019s nice to know that no matter how much one can afford to spend, we all suffer equally getting to the airport. Write to Anne Kadet at Anne.Kadet@wsj.com",

        "article": "Chairman Phil Mendelson will gavel the D.C. Council back to work Monday. (Sarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post) The D.C. Council gets back to work Tuesday after a two-month break from its lawmaking duties. An attempt to override the mayoral veto of the large-retailer \u201cliving wage\u201d bill is likely to garner the most attention next week, but legislators will be dealing with several other notable measures \u2014 including reforms to the city\u2019s system for collecting delinquent property taxes recently highlighted in a Washington Post investigative series. The main reform measure is being proposed by Jack Evans (D-Ward 2), who first introduced legislation to reform the tax sale process last year but has not yet moved the bill forward. His emergency measure on Tuesday\u2019s agenda will cancel the sales of properties owned by senior citizens, veterans or the disabled; cap attorney\u2019s fees on tax-sale cases at $1,500; and provide that no properties owing the city less than $2,000 are auctioned in the first place. The measure also allows a property owner to recover his or her equity should a tax sale proceed to foreclosure. The bill, like all emergency legislation, is effective for 90 days and requires the votes of nine of 13 members. Several members have already expressed support for various provisions included in the bill. Evans said he will pursue permanent legislation in short order. Also proposing an emergency bill related to the tax sales is Mary Cheh (D-Ward 3), who wants city financial officials to conduct a \u201cbroad review\u201d of tax sales dating back to 2003 \u201cto determine if there is excusable neglect or other equitable circumstances warranting relief.\u201d Under the bill, the internal watchdog for the Office of the Chief Financial Officer would be required to report to the council by Dec. 1 on, among other things, whether the owners of properties sold off over tax bills of $2,500 or less \u201cshould be granted relief, and, if relief is recommended, the equitable remedy that would provide substantial justice.\u201d \u201cWe need a sense of how many people were injured, the costs associated with remedying those injuries, and a plan to effect those remedies,\u201d Cheh said in a statement. The council will take up a host of other emergency measures, according to a draft agenda circulated Friday: \u2022 UberX legalization. Cheh and David Grosso (I-At Large) are offering a measure that would keep Uber\u2019s lower-cost UberX car service, as well as smartphone-based ridesharing services like Lyft and Sidecar, street legal at least until January, when a D.C. Taxicab Commission panel would be required to make recommendations on new regulations. The bill sets aside rules passed by the commission earlier this summer that made the UberX business model illegal. \u2022 Visitor parking passes. Muriel Bowser (D-Ward 4), joining with Cheh, is moving to preserve the status quo on visitor parking permits following an uproar over a new system announced by the city transportation department. The existing program \u2014 where residents in some areas are automatically sent free visitor passes, while residents of other neighborhoods are not \u2014 \u201crecognizes that different Wards and neighborhoods have different parking needs,\u201d Bowser said in a memo. The proposed system \u2014 which would allow all residents to request a free pass from the city \u2014 \u201dwould end this tailored approach for a clumsy, \u2018one-size fits all\u2019 policy,\u201d she added. \u2022 ANC exception to ethics disclosures. Bowser is proposing an emergency amendment to the ethics overhaul her committee wrote in 2011, excepting advisory neighborhood commissioners from rigorous financial disclosures. She explains in a memo: \u201cThe role of ANC Commissioners is fundamentally different than the role of Councilmembers or high-ranking officials. ANC Commissioners don\u2019t vote or effect policy or decision-making in the same, direct way as do other public officials. Moreover, the nature of the financial disclosure requirement may deter ANC Commissioners \u2014 who are volunteers \u2014 from continuing to serve.\u201d \u2022 \u201cLiving wage\u201d measures. Besides the decisive vote on the Large Retailer Accountability Act, council members could vote on two emergency measures proposed by Vincent B. Orange (D-At Large), a key LRAA backer. One creates a tax credit for the retailers targeted in the bill vetoed by Gray, reimbursing them $1,000 for every District employee paid at least $12.50 an hour in wages and benefits, but with a yearly income of less than $50,000. The other is a sense-of-the-council endorsement of a hike to the federal minimum wage, which would have no practical effect except to possibly influence the congressional debate. \u2022 Traffic camera moratorium. Orange is also renewing his efforts to place curbs on automated traffic enforcement. In June, he introduced the \u201cAutomated Traffic Enforcement Moratorium Act of 2013,\u201d which would restrict where cameras could be placed and would require warning signs in the cameras\u2019 vicinity. Orange\u2019s emergency bill comes as the D.C. police are in the process of rolling out new types of enforcement cameras, including red-light cameras and block-the-box cameras. \u201dUnless immediate action is taken by the Council, the Executive will continue to increase the number of automated traffic enforcement units with impunity,\u201d Orange warned his colleagues in a Thursday memo.",

        "article": "By BARBARA ROSS DAILY NEWS STAFF WRITER Thursday, June 14th 2001, 2:21AM Eric Lewenstein is a product of privilege - the son of a successful New York physician and the grandson of a wealthy financier and a woman once described as the most-photographed model in the world. But for the second time in less than five years, the 25-year-old Marymount College student finds himself accused of committing date rape in an East Side restaurant, the Daily News has learned. Lewenstein is charged with raping and sexually abusing a woman in February at L'Express on Park Ave. South. Sources said the allegation has prompted investigators to take a second look at a March 1997 date-rape complaint filed against Lewenstein by an aspiring actress from Norway. Manhattan prosecutors also said they know of two other incidents - in which women accused him of forcible sex - that were not reported to police. Lewenstein, who is free on $25,000 bail and living with his mother and stepfather in their spacious E. 83rd St. apartment, did not return repeated telephone calls for comment. But his lawyer, John Carman, said Lewenstein denies raping the woman at L'Express. \"Eric's position is that they did not have intercourse,\" said Carman. As for the earlier case, the lawyer said authorities are \"trying to resurrect a case that wasn't prosecutable to support a case they're having great difficulty with now.\" Leon Lewenstein, an obstetrician-gynecologist at Mount Sinai Medical Center, did not want to talk about his son, whose maternal grandfather, David Schulte, is a politically connected financier and member of the city's Board of Correction. His grandmother Lili Carlton Schulte, who died last year, was a Ford model and the nation's top cover girl in the 1940s. In the most recent case, Lewenstein's date told police he started kissing her in a rest room of L'Express, then slammed her head into a wall, \"ripped her pants off\" and raped her. She reported the assault immediately, but it took two months before Lewenstein was quietly arrested and charged. In the March 1997 case, the actress told cops that he had attacked and sodomized her in a rest room at Merchants N.Y., a restaurant on First Ave. But charges were not filed against Lewenstein because the woman could not positively identify him, according to court records. Later, the actress filed a multimillion-dollar civil suit against Merchants and Lewenstein. It recently was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum. In an interview this week, the actress insisted she had no trouble picking Lewenstein out of the lineup but added, \"I thought there was something slightly different\" about him. \"The detectives started harassing me,\" she said. \"They kept saying 'Are you sure?' They said if I was not sure, I could be committing a crime. I could ruin someone for life.\" \"I said I was 99% sure,\" but one detective told her later, \" 'It's too bad you were not 100% sure because they let him go.' \" The woman, who asked not to be identified, said prosecutors recently called her about the case but that she is reluctant to rehash the past because she is only now beginning to recover. Investigators believe Lewenstein might have assaulted other women. At his arraignment in April, Assistant District Attorney Kavita Gopwani said, \"This marks the fourth time the defendant has been accused of forcible sex.\" The actress said she also believes she was \"not the first\" woman Lewenstein assaulted because, she said, he knew exactly how to immobilize her. He \"held my hair in a ponytail grip in a way that twisted my neck and paralyzed my spine,\" she said. He then \"smashed my head against the toilet, the tile floor, the walls,\" she said. \"I would have died if I hadn't covered my forehead with my arms. \"Then he tried to strangle me. I thought I was dead,\" she said, describing how she almost blacked out. \"He tried to kill me in that bathroom. It was not a case of 'I'm horny.' He was on a mission. It was scary!\" She told police she escaped from the locked rest room by pretending to black out, opening the door when Lewenstein's back was turned and falling into the arms of a bartender. In the civil suit against Lewenstein and Merchants, the actress' lawyer, Edward Bailey, suggested that Lewenstein confused his client by substituting his fraternal twin brother, Scott, in the police lineup. However, authorities said they are confident there was no substitution because Scott Lewenstein was out of the country on the day of the lineup.",

        "article": "August 2, 2013: The emblem of a Toyota car shines at Toyota Motor Corp.'s showroom Toyota Mega Web in Tokyo. (AP Photo/Itsuo Inouye, File) TOKYO \u2013 Toyota Motor Corp. is recalling 6.39 million vehicles globally for a variety of problems spanning nearly 30 models in Japan, the U.S., Europe and other places. No injuries or crashes have been reported related to the recalls announced Wednesday. But two fires have been reported related to one of the problems, a defective engine starter that can keep the motor running. Some vehicles were recalled for more than one problem. The recall cases total 6.76 million vehicles for 27 Toyota models, the Pontiac Vibe and the Subaru Trezia, produced from April 2004 through August 2013. The Pontiac Vibe, which is a General Motors Co. model, is also involved because Toyota and GM made cars at the same plant in California and the recalled model is the same as the Toyota Matrix. It was recalled for a problem with a spiral cable attached to an air-bag. It is unrelated to a separate GM recall over ignition switches linked to at least 13 deaths. Subaru is partly owned by Toyota, and the model was the same as the Toyota Vitz. For the recall, Toyota also reported problems with seat rails, the bracket holding the steering column in place, the windshield-wiper motor and a cable attached to the air-bag module. The recalls affect a large range of models, including the Corolla, RAV4, Matrix, Yaris, Highlander, and Tacoma. Toyota was embroiled in a massive recall crisis in the U.S. starting in late 2009 and continuing through 2010, covering a wide range of problems including faulty floor mats, sticky gas pedals and defective brakes. In response, it has become quicker to recall cars and Last month, the Japanese automaker reached a settlement with the U.S. Justice Department to pay a $1.2 billion penalty for hiding information about defects in its cars. It earlier paid fines of more than $66 million for delays in reporting unintended acceleration problems. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration never found defects in electronics or software in Toyota cars, which had been targeted as a possible cause. The focus in the U.S. auto industry has recently shifted to another major recall problem, this time with defective ignitions in compact cars made by GM.",

A test that the Times said was used for the first time at this year's Tour detected a specific type of chemical, called a plasticizer, that is found in plastic IV bags. Evidence of that chemical in an athlete's urine could mean the athlete has used a blood transfusion to boost endurance. Contador's spokesman, Jacinto Vidarte, on Tuesday denied any plastic residues were found in the tests. \"We are not aware of any findings of this plastic substance in any of the tests,\" Vidarte told the AP. \"We, officially and unofficially, have no information on anything to do with this. There were no traces of plastic in any of the tests.\" Francisco Contador, the rider's brother and manager, also denied there was blood doping. \"There is not even the remotest possibility of speaking of blood manipulation because Alberto has not done anything illegal, neither in the Tour or ever,\" he told Cadena Ser radio. \"We have absolutely nothing to hide.\" The World Anti-Doping Agency bans blood transfusions or any intravenous infusions, except in a medical emergency, according to the Times. The International Cycling Union drug-testing chaperones took the urine sample from Contador on July 20, the eve of the Tour's final rest day, said the person, who wanted to remain anonymous because of an agreement to keep the information confidential while Contador's investigation is continuing, the newspaper reported. Contador tested positive for clenbuterol one day later, and was subsequently provisionally suspended by the ICU, which could strip him of his Tour crown and suspend him for two years if he is convicted of a doping offense. Stories out of France and Germany last week also said traces of a plasticizer were found in Contador's urine, the Associated Press reported. Contador has repeatedly denied doping or having a transfusion, instead blaming the clenbuterol on contaminated meat. UCI spokesman Enrico Carpani told the AP on Tuesday that the cycling body was working with WADA to analyze the elements of Contador's case. He said the UCI would not comment further, citing confidentiality rules. You share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

        "article": "ABOUT a third of the way into a recent meal at the refined, quietly elegant new TriBeCa restaurant Corton, something wholly surprising \u0097 and altogether wonderful \u0097 happened. I forgot about my food. Evan Sung for The New York Times NO DISTRACTIONS Corton has moved into the space on West Broadway that was Montrachet. I don\u2019t exactly mean \u201cforgot.\u201d I was aware of what I was eating: juicy, sweet scallops with a sea urchin cream that showed a different side of the sea to beautifully complementary effect; sweetbread nuggets suitable for a master class on the ideal texture for these delicacies, best when neither too crunchy nor mushy. But to appreciate these dishes fully I didn\u2019t need to conduct a mental inventory of their disparate ingredients, marvel over technique or puzzle over an unlikely flavor combination on the precipice of foolishness. I could just let them wash over me. The pleasure they principally engineered was sensual \u0097 and easy. And that surprised me because they were the work of Paul Liebrandt. Mr. Liebrandt, 32, is the kitchen prankster who did eel with crystallized violets at Atlas and, at Gilt, executed a menu that affirmed his talent but brought his judgment into question. He sometimes indulged eccentricity for its own sake or set off an exhausting surfeit of fireworks. At Corton he calms down and wises up, accepting that an evening in a restaurant shouldn\u2019t be like a visit to a fringe art gallery: geared to the intellect, reliant on provocation. It needn\u2019t demand raptness. And it must, in the course of whatever else it means to accomplish, leave a person eager for the next bite and intent on the one after that. In fact the best appetizer I had at Corton was an essentially classic, relatively straightforward torchon of foie gras. Yes, Mr. Liebrandt gave the torchon a distinctive beet and hibiscus glaze that left the circle of it before me with a ruby aureole. But in the end it was the creamy, sublimely prepared foie that got me and my companions. And the triumphant glory of a beef entree wasn\u2019t any flamboyant embellishment but rather the richest, most tender and most flavorful fillet I\u2019ve had in recent memory. Mr. Liebrandt\u2019s benefactor and partner in this project is the restaurateur Drew Nieporent, who may well have something to do with the chef\u2019s newfound restraint. Mr. Nieporent\u2019s other restaurants include Nobu, Centrico and the Tribeca Grill, and used to include Montrachet, whose space Corton inherited and refashioned. He isn\u2019t the type to let self-conscious artistry overtake good sense. And while he no doubt intended to head in a less bluntly and less broadly crowd-pleasing direction by teaming with Mr. Liebrandt, he obviously had some indication that Mr. Liebrandt was willing to play nice. At Corton Mr. Liebrandt finds the sweet spot between disciplined cooking and intricate, imaginative leaps. Intricacy and imagination are still there: in a simultaneously ethereal and earthy \u201crisotto\u201d that floats a white cloud of salt cod foam over a dark terrain of black trumpet mushrooms and riso pasta; in an \u201colive sponge\u201d canap\u00e9 both lighter in weight and more intense in olive flavor than the laws of physics and gastronomy would seem to permit; in a seaweed butter, served with the bread, that called to mind caviar in a whole new guise. And Mr. Liebrandt\u2019s version of a seasonal salad breaks down to more than a dozen vegetables and fruits prepared in nearly as many ways. Parsley root is pur\u00e9ed, kabocha squash braised, baby brussels sprouts saut\u00e9ed in browned butter, eggplant roasted, quince poached in white wine \u0097 and so on and so forth. But these exertions aren\u2019t obvious or showy. They\u2019re a generous attempt to orchestrate a varied medley of tastes both more and less familiar. And while dish after dish has subtle nuances or an inspired finishing touch, each succeeds primarily for simpler, more basic reasons: the happy marriage of squab, bacon and a chestnut cream in an entree that further reflects the premium Mr. Liebrandt places on the seasons; the exquisite moistness of butter-poached turbot in the center of an artful composition with many visual and textural fillips, all quietly beguiling, none disruptive. Corton is for the most part superb, and joins the constantly improving Eleven Madison Park as a restaurant hovering just below the very summit of fine dining in New York.",

        "article": "Mexico City \u2014 It was a television executive\u2019s nightmare: Not only was someone threatening to sue over a TV series, but that person was reputedly the biggest drug trafficker on the planet and the head of a cartel behind a long string of mass executions and torture videos. The first sign of trouble came in May, after Netflix and Univision released a trailer for their series \u201cEl Chapo,\u201d based on the imprisoned Mexican kingpin Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n. The trafficker\u2019s lawyer announced through various media outlets that he would go to court if his client\u2019s name and story were used without payment. \u201cThe se\u00f1or\u201d \u2014 Mr. Guzm\u00e1n \u2014 \u201chas not died. He is not a character in the public domain. He is alive. He has to grant them permission,\u201d the lawyer, Andr\u00e9s Granados, told a Mexican radio station. The declarations put the show\u2019s producers in a predicament. If they go ahead with the series, due in 2017, they could face a legal battle \u2014 and the possibility that, should he lose, Mr. Guzm\u00e1n might seek retribution out of court. But if they get into negotiating with Mr. Guzm\u00e1n, they face other problems. Would they be cooperating with organized crime? El Chapo\u2019s lawyer suggested that he could help make the TV series better by giving details no journalist had yet dug up. But could that mean acting as a propaganda instrument for a crime boss? The quandary reflects bigger dilemmas in the growing world of narco fiction. Dramatic portrayals of Mexican crime kings, which began as zany B-grade movies, have evolved into wildly popular soap operas, best-selling novels and major Hollywood productions. They are part of a wider narco culture, ranging from pop-music ballads to fashion trends. Meanwhile, from 2007 to 2014 more than 80,000 Mexicans were killed by cartel-related violence, according to a government count. May was the most murderous month in Mexico in almost four years. Mexico\u2019s narco-films took off with the straight-to-video technology of the 1980s, often shot in a couple of weeks and starring real-life strippers, real guns and real criminals firing them. Titles like \u201cThe Big Bazooka Shot,\u201d \u201cThe Elite Narco Commando\u201d and \u201cScarface Reborn\u201d are popular in Mexican communities in the United States. Some traffickers finance their own biopics: When Edgar Valdez Villarreal, known as La Barbie, was arrested in 2010, he told the police that he had given producers $200,000 to make a movie about him. The narco action film first made its way into the more popular and better-produced telenovelas in Colombia in the mid-2000s, before expanding to Mexico at the end of the decade. Local TV networks made hits like \u201cSin Tetas No Hay Paraiso\u201d (\u201cWithout Breasts, There Is No Paradise\u201d) and \u201cEl Cartel de Los Sapos\u201d (\u201cThe Cartel of the Snitches\u201d), which was based on a book by a real Colombian trafficker who was imprisoned in the United States. They worked well, featuring a gritty realism while maintaining the glamour and entertainment value of Latin soaps. Last year, the drug war made its big break into the mainstream American media market with the release of the Oscar-nominated movie \u201cSicario,\u201d the Netflix series \u201cNarcos\u201d and the best-selling novel \u201cThe Cartel,\u201d by Don Winslow. All have been commercial and critical hits, despite protests by the mayor of Ju\u00e1rez against \u201cSicario\u201d for portraying his city in a bad light. The success of \u201cNarcos,\u201d which paints a largely true picture of the Colombian kingpin Pablo Escobar, paved the way for Netflix to work on production of the \u201cEl Chapo\u201d series.",

        "article": "If you read my column last week you know the dim view I take of the Universal Basic Income \u2014 a minimum level of money offered to every citizen \u2014 as a tool to combat poverty in a country like the United States where there is still plenty of work for most people to do. Paying for it would require either shredding the safety net as we know it or raising taxes to Scandinavian levels. On Sunday, an overwhelming majority of Swiss voters apparently agreed, voting down a proposal to give every adult roughly $2,560 a month, regardless of their work status, and $640 for each child under 18. But that doesn\u2019t end the case for a universal income, as many of the brightest minds in Silicon Valley will tell anyone who asks. If we are facing a not-so-distant future of robot-fueled growth and rising potential for mass disemployment, maybe it\u2019s time to start thinking about how to provide a lot more income that isn\u2019t directly tied to a job. Jeffrey D. Sachs of Columbia University has been working with a series of colleagues on an economic model of a world in which robotization both raises economic output and immiserates workers, pushing them out of their jobs. It is not a theoretical impossibility. \u201cThe point for me is that these two scenarios \u2014 robots lead to nirvana and hell \u2014 can happen side by side,\u201d Professor Sachs told me. \u201cGenerally capital wins and all labor can lose. It shows up as a fall in the labor share of national income.\u201d In that event, preventing a dynastic society of relentlessly growing inequality would require large-scale redistribution. It could even take the form of a universal income paid for with a hefty estate tax \u2014 using some of the vast profits accruing to the owners of robots to finance a living for everybody else. Since most paid human labor would be pointless, the disincentive to work produced by a monthly check would be unimportant. People could devote themselves to unpaid creative affairs. \u201cDon\u2019t destroy the robots,\u201d Professor Sachs said. But recognize that \u201cnot everybody would be better off as a result of market forces. With redistribution everybody could be made better off.\u201d Many experts are not convinced. For every analysis like this one \u2014 forecasting that half of all jobs in the United States will be replaced by new technology \u2014 others point out that there is no evidence of humanity\u2019s impending redundancy. A research paper published last month by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development argued that even the occupations most at risk of being replaced by machines contained lots of tasks that were hard to automate, like face-to-face interaction with customers. It concluded that only 9 percent of American workers faced a high risk of being replaced by an automaton. Austrians, Germans and Spaniards were the most vulnerable, but only 12 percent of them risked losing their jobs to information technology. China faces rising labor costs and a shortage of workers. But a government project called \u201creplacing humans with robots\u201d is trying to change the face of the work force in Guangdong Province. Ever since the Luddites started smashing textile machines in the 19th century, workers have, as a whole, done rather well adapting to new technologies, retooling to find new jobs in other industries. Employment has increased throughout the modern age. As Kenneth S. Rogoff of Harvard put it a few years ago: It seems unlikely that millions of workers are headed to the glue factory like discarded horses. And yet the nature of the new research, patiently counting how many jobs are likely to stay or go, suggests how far economists have come from the days when they simply dismissed popular fears of technological unemployment as ludicrous. Last November, Lawrence H. Summers \u2014 a former Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton, a top economic adviser in President Obama\u2019s first term and one of the youngest people to earn tenure on the Harvard faculty \u2014 strode up to the podium at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington and made an unlikely admission: Perhaps economists were not always the smartest people in the room. He reminisced about his undergraduate days at M.I.T. in the 1970s, when the debate over the idea of technological unemployment pitted \u201csmart people,\u201d exemplified by the great economist Robert Solow, and \u201cstupid people,\u201d \u201cexemplified by a bunch of sociologists.\u201d It was stupid to think technological progress would reduce employment. If technology increased productivity \u2014 allowing companies and their workers to make more stuff in less time \u2014 people would have more money to spend on more things that would have to be made, creating jobs for other people. But at some point Mr. Summers experienced an epiphany. \u201cIt sort of occurred to me,\u201d he said. \u201cSuppose the stupid people were right. What would it look like?\u201d And what it looked like fits pretty well with what the world looks like today. For large categories of workers, wages are inadequate. Many are withdrawing from the labor force altogether. In the 1960s, one in 20 men between 25 and 54 were not working. Today it\u2019s three in 20. The population is generally healthier than it was in the 1960s; work is almost uniformly less demanding. Still, more workers are on disability. \u201cMaybe the stupid people weren\u2019t quite as stupid as I thought they were,\u201d Mr. Summers conceded. \u201cThis was at least a serious concern that had to be thought about.\u201d In a world in which many Americans do not work during large chunks of their lives, we might have to conceive of Social Security and disability much more broadly than we do today. That, Mr. Summers said, \u201ccould start to look like a universal income.\u201d",

        "article": "Carl von Clausewitz (Photo credit: Wikipedia) Prussian military theorist Carl von Clausewitz famously declared war is \u201cmere policy by other means.\u201d Detroit\u2019s bankruptcy is similar. Saddled with billions of dollars in bond debt and pension obligations it can never repay, Michigan\u2019s largest city has resorted to settling its deep-rooted fiscal and political problems in court. By filing Chapter 9 bankruptcy, Detroit has effectively handed its fate over to a federal bankruptcy judge, along with the difficult questions of how to divide its inadequate resources among more than 100,000 creditors. Among other things, that judge will have to tackle the politically charged question of whether the city\u2019s public employees can jump ahead of bondholders and other creditors to collect pension payments that vastly exceed both financial reserves and the city\u2019s likely ability to repay. \u201cThis was going to be battled out politically inside or outside of bankruptcy, and that\u2019s not going to change,\u201d said David A. Skeel, a professor at the Univeristy of Pennsylvania Law School who has written extensively about the political and legal questions swirling around government insolvency. \u201cThe court is a referee, an umpire, but ultimately the parties have to make the proposals.\u201d Already, a Michigan state judge has declared the bankruptcy filing illegal because it violates a provision of the Michigan Constitution prohibiting any modification of public pensions. Federal law trumps state law under the U.S. Constitution\u2019s Supremacy Clause, however, so Skeel thinks there is a good chance the Michigan judge will be overruled eventually. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine that decision stands,\u201d Skeel told me, not least because no impairment of pensions has yet been proposed. He called it the \u201cfirst salvo in a judicial process we\u2019re just beginning.\u201d Congress first passed a provision of the bankruptcy code allowing for municipal bankruptcies back in 1934, which the Supreme Court promptly found unconstitutional for violating both the 10th Amendment (powers not explicitly granted to Congress are reserved to the states) and the clause prohibiting impairment of contracts. Congress slightly amended the law and the Supreme Court \u2014 chastened by FDR\u2019s 1937 threat to pack it with more cooperative justices \u2014 approved Chapter 9 in 1939. Since then there have been relatively few municipal bankruptcies, although the number has ticked up in recent years. Much like airlines, which entered a serial bankruptcy phase after the industry was deregulated in order to rework union contracts, more cities have turned to federal bankruptcy court to solve intractable disputes over debt loads and public pensions. The city of Vallejo, Calif. was prohibited under state law from closing non-essential fire stations or modifying pensions, for example, but achieved both in bankruptcy court. When Skeel wrote an influential article proposing the equivalent of Chapter 9 for overleveraged states, critics said \u201cno real city uses Chapter 9,\u201d he said. With Detroit\u2019s filing, that statement is no longer accurate. \u201cI really think it changes your perspective on that, and it forces you to think Chapter 9 is one of the main tools in the tool kit when a municipality is in trouble.\u201d Is that a bad thing? Skeel thinks not. Cities like Detroit \u2014 and states like Illinois, California and Connecticut \u2014 got into fiscal trouble because their political leaders spent too much and promised too much to public-sector employees in the form of future pension benefits. That\u2019s a fundamental problem with elective politics, of course: It\u2019s easier for today\u2019s politicians to make promises they can\u2019t keep than deliver financial reality to their constituents. In that sense, pension underfunding is one of the main tools politicians use to get around state laws requiring balanced budgets. \u201cBankruptcy doesn\u2019t fix that problem,\u201d Skeel said, but it might make politicians think twice about making pension promises they can\u2019t keep, especially since many of them participate in the same plans, with higher projected payouts than typical employees. (One senior Texas legislator stood to earn 660% of his state salary in retirement, Skeel\u2019s article notes.) \u201cOne problem with unsustainable pensions is we really didn\u2019t have both sides at the bargaining table,\u201d since politicians were the beneficiaries of both pensions and the votes of government employees. \u201cThe bankruptcy option forces the parties, particularly the recipients of these pensions, to recognize they may not be sustainable in a reorganization.\u201d Michigan, like other states, has attempted to protect municipal pensions through its constitution. But Skeel thinks a federal judge, compelled under the law to treat creditors equally, might limit that protection to the portion of the pension backed by actual pension assets. The promise of future payments might fall into the category of an unsecured debt, although courts haven\u2019t actually decided this precise issue yet. Skeel is criticized by Richard C. Schragger, a professor at the University of Virginia School of Law who says it is incorrect and unfair to blame the problems of cities like Detroit on their elected leaders. Detroit, like a lot of northern industrial cities, is also the victim of state neglect and laws that allowed affluent suburbs to shield themselves from the city\u2019s financial problems. As businesses and rich citizens moved outside the city\u2019s borders, Schragger said, Detroit was left with 700,000 mostly poor residents with the same demand for schools and other government services.",

Orange County Sheriff Sandra Hutchens informed the security officers last week that they will no longer have arrest powers, won\u2019t be able to issue misdemeanor citations and cannot carry their weapons off duty without a concealed weapons permit. Hutchens was forced to make the move after the California Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training sent a notice to the department in May saying that the 200 special safety officers may not meet the minimum standard for sworn police officers with arrest powers. Under California law, the commission sets the standards for police officers and their training. Orange County Asst. Sheriff Tim Board said safety officers receive four months of academy training compared to six months in the academy for sheriff\u2019s deputies. Board said the officers have long patrolled the airport, protected court buildings and assisted in the jails, but the commission has decided to take issue with the amount of training they receive. The commission also requires a department to notify the state oversight agency anytime a law enforcement officer is hired or fired. Board said that has not occurred with the special officers. Two years ago, Hutchens began allowing the safety officers to make misdemeanor arrests without a deputy present, Board said. The move occurred at a time when the department was facing annual budget cuts and was battling to maintain the number of deputies on patrol. Board said the officers will continue to be paid the same amount and do the same work. \u201cIt is not going to truly impact their work.... They'll still be able to issue traffic citations at the airport and supervise people entering the courthouse or other county buildings,\u201d he said. Several sources said the action immediately affected morale among the special officers and some expressed concern that they could no longer carry their weapons off duty and could be confronted by former arrestees. Nick Berardino, Orange County Employees Assn. general manager, sent a memo to the officers represented by the union in response to Hutchens\u2019 decision. \u201cWe have immediately turned over this issue to our legal team, which is evaluating our next steps. In addition, we are demanding to meet with the department, and we are requesting all copies of correspondence related to the matter,\u201d he wrote.

        "article": "By KARIN FISCHER | THE CHRONICLE OF HIGHER EDUCATIONMARCH 30, 2014 SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 A desire to produce well-rounded graduates, an influx of Chinese students, heartburn over university rankings: Such universal topics were among the subjects of discussion at the three-day annual meeting of the Asia-Pacific Association for International Education in Seoul, South Korea, which ended March 20. Several university presidents and vice chancellors from Asia lamented an overemphasis in higher education on graduates\u2019 employability. There is too great a focus, they said, on imparting a narrow set of skills rather than on educating students broadly. Are modern universities, asked Inwon Choue, president of Kyung Hee University, in Seoul, \u201cbegetting academic excellence without soul?\u201d Flora Chia-I Chang, president of Tamkang University, a private institution in Taiwan, said that while professional preparation is important, so too are the liberal arts and extracurricular activities. At Tamkang, students are required to participate in at least one club, she said. \u201cMany universities emphasize professional education and forget character cultivation,\u201d Ms. Chang said. \u201cWe want to prepare students to work professionally and live soundly.\u201d But Gordon W.H. Cheung, the association\u2019s departing president and an associate vice president at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said universities in Asia often focused less on the arts and humanities because they felt pressure to concentrate on the sciences. That, he said, is because global university rankings include measures of scientific research in their calculations. In a region where institutions\u2019 performance is a matter of national pride, universities are acutely aware of the rankings. At the same time, international rankings seem inherently stacked against institutions in Asia. With a few notable exceptions, Asian universities are less wealthy than their counterparts in Europe and North America, and less able to invest in top academics and research. And for most, their faculty members\u2019 native language is not English. The major global rankings consider faculty publications and citations in major international academic journals, all of which are in English. \u201cEnglish is a hardship which we cannot overcome,\u201d said Lee Yong-goo, president of South Korea\u2019s Chung-Ang University. Some papers written by his faculty members, he said, have \u201cgood content but poor English,\u201d and thus are not accepted by international journals. Mr. Lee said his professors also struggled to teach in English. About 30 percent of his institution\u2019s courses are taught in English, partly to attract foreign students. Most of Chung-Ang\u2019s international students are from China, he said, noting that Chinese students made up a large share of the foreign enrollments on many Asian university campuses. \u201cChina,\u201d he said, \u201cis a big giant in all of our universities.\u201d Chinese universities, however, were relatively poorly represented at the conference, which drew some 1,300 participants from Asia, Australia, Europe and North America, including many from Japan, South Korea and the United States. Next year, the Chinese presence may be greater: The conference will be held in Beijing. Like their United States counterparts, Asian educators are wrestling with new developments in online learning. Major providers of massive open online courses, or MOOCs, like Coursera and edX, have recently made inroads into the Chinese market. But could a homegrown MOOC catch on? Lee Wei-I, a professor at National Chiao Tung University, in Taiwan, and a founder of ewant, a MOOC started by a consortium of Taiwanese and mainland Chinese universities, says it could. \u201cThere are localized services that I think an international platform can\u2019t offer,\u201d Mr. Lee told a session on online learning. Started last fall by National Chiao Tung University and four Chinese partner institutions, ewant has thus far offered seven courses, in subjects including statistics, computer programming and Chinese medicine, and enrolled about 10,000 students. In its next phase, Mr. Lee plans to add 10 to 15 partners, including some of China\u2019s most elite universities. About 50 courses will be available. So far, most MOOCs have not been offered for credit. But Mr. Lee, who also started the first open-courseware website in Taiwan, thinks there is a desire in the region for for-credit online courses, particularly among companies seeking training for their employees. Few options for on-the-job training and professional development exist in China and Taiwan, he said. Ewant\u2019s courses will be free, but companies will be charged for specialized \u201cadd-ons.\u201d Students will also pay a small fee to take a proctored examination. While many of the major MOOC providers use online webcams and specialized software to monitor students taking tests, such methods engender little trust in China and Taiwan, where exam fraud is common, Mr. Lee said.",

        "article": "The BRICS\u2013those once hot emerging markets including Brazil, Russia, India, and China\u2013have been beleaguered for some time. Brazil and Russia are in full blown recessions, China is trying to stave off a big slow down, and India, while still of interest to global investors, is struggling to put through the economic reforms that would help it reach its full potential. No wonder then, that Goldman Sachs, whose former chief economist Jim O\u2019Neill coined the term BRIC to encompass the world\u2019s emerging market darlings, has quietly closed down its BRIC fund, which had lost 88% of its asset value since 2010, and folded the BRIC investments into its larger emerging market funds. The BRICs, it seems, are finally broken. So what does this tell us about the emerging market story as a whole? For starters, the end of the BRIC era really isn\u2019t a surprise. Ruchir Sharma, the head of emerging markets for Morgan Stanley Investment Management, really called it in his 2012 book, Breakout Nations. As he put it then, the slowdown of the BRICS shouldn\u2019t be a surprise\u2026 \u201c\u2026because it is hard to sustain rapid growth for more than a decade. The unusual circumstances of the last decade made it look easy: coming off the crisis-ridden 1990s and fueled by a global flood of easy money, the emerging markets took off in a mass upward swing that made virtually every economy a winner. By 2007, when only three countries in the world suffered negative growth, recessions had all but disappeared from the international scene. But now, there is a lot less foreign money flowing into emerging markets. The global economy is returning to its normal state of churn, with many laggards and just a few winners rising in unexpected places. The implications of this shift are striking, because economic momentum is power, and thus the flow of money to rising stars will reshape the global balance of power.\u201d In short, the story of emerging markets is no longer just one story with a straight line trajectory, but a collection of varied investment narratives\u2014Brazil down, Mexico up; Turkey falling, the Philippines rising, and so on. While emerging markets used to rise and fall as a group, countries have diverged from each other, as have asset classes. Part of this is due to the slowdown in China, which has in turn been a big factor in lower commodity prices, which benefit energy importing nations (rich and poor) but hurt big commodity exporters like Russia and Brazil, as well as parts of West Africa and the Middle East. None of this is to say that the BRIC nations\u2014China especially\u2014don\u2019t still have tremendous power within the global economy. China has been the biggest contributor to global growth since the 2008 financial crisis and Great Recession, and what happens there matters more than ever within the global context. As Sharma told me recently, \u201cthe next global recession will likely be made in China.\u201d While the Chinese stock market has made up pretty much all its losses since its crash this summer, that doesn\u2019t mean the Chinese economy as a whole has rebounded. Indeed, Sharma and others believe that the jury is still out about whether the Middle Kingdom can shift its economic model in such a way that it can make the leap to becoming a middle class nation. (It\u2019s the toughest economic leap to make\u2014one that only three other nations in Asia, Singapore, South Korea and Japan, have managed). That underscores the key point about the end of the BRIC era: no nation can sustain double digit growth forever. As the BRICs got richer, it was inevitable that their growth would slow and they would be replaced by other \u201chot\u201d emerging markets. (Goldman has plenty of less catchy acronyms for those, like the N-11 nations.) And rich countries like the U.S. still hold plenty of clout in the global economy, too. Indeed, what happens in the BRICs and the rest of the emerging markets over the next few months will have as much to do with the Fed as with China\u2014as America\u2019s central bank raises rates, which will inevitably strengthen the dollar, many emerging market nations and companies with dollar pegged economies and dollar denominated debt will come under pressure. That may break more than just the BRICs.",

        "article": "Politicians may talk a lot about inequality this election year \u2014 and accomplish little more. But Washington has a realistic opportunity to lift millions of people out of poverty with a potential deal sitting in front of President Obama and Republicans in Congress that would help a lot of poor people and encourage employment. If this country still has leaders, they will take advantage of it. On Tuesday, Obama proposed expanding the earned-income tax credit (EITC), which tops up the wages of working Americans hovering around the poverty line. Because this policy mitigates the misery of some 27 million low-income Americans while dignifying and rewarding work, economists left and right like it. Conservative experts often argue that boosting the EITC would be significantly better than raising the minimum wage, which they say depresses hiring. So, Obama is saying, let\u2019s do it. Relative to the amounts that poor parents get, the EITC jilts adults without dependents \u2014 even if they have children others claim as dependents. Workers under 25 get nothing at all. The president\u2019s new budget plan would increase the benefit to dependent-less adults and lower the age floor on eligibility, helping 13.5 million people. New York Magazine\u2019s Jonathan Chait argues that Obama has called Republicans\u2019 bluff on the EITC: If they really mean what they say about their desire to help the poor, they will now seek to expand the EITC; if they just praise the EITC in order to attack raising the minimum wage, they won\u2019t. But that\u2019s not quite right, because Republicans are concerned about another problem with the policy. My colleague Chuck Lane points out that the EITC\u2019s complex eligibility criteria discourage needy people from claiming it and encourage abuse, with billions regularly overpaid. Last week, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp (R-Mich.) proposed a reform that would make the EITC easier to administer, combating fraud. Camp, though, would also significantly cut the size of the benefit\u2019s payouts. The potential deal, then, is obvious: Combine EITC expansion with reform. Make sure the right people are getting the benefit, then give them more for their work. Lane stresses that Camp\u2019s reform could save significant amounts of money. Policymakers could drive that back into the EITC program and find more from elsewhere if necessary \u2014 Chait suggests Democrats offer chained CPI, a reform to Social Security, though that would complicate the deal-making \u2014 to fund a particularly worthy policy. Unlike a lot of compromises in Washington, a competently designed expansion-reform bargain would result in better policy. Office of Management and Budget Director Sylvia Mathews Burwell on Tuesday told Post editorial writers that, given Republican interest in the EITC, \u201csomething could happen.\u201d The president should directly approach GOP leaders with an openness to reform as well as expansion. At that point, Republicans would have even less excuse to do nothing.",

        "article": "Monday, September 29, is National Coffee Day, when restaurant and coffee chains around the country are giving out free (or extremely cheap) cups of Joe to the masses. The day is quite the exception, however, given how as a nation we are spending more and more on coffee. Here are 7 reasons why: We\u2019re drinking coffee earlier in life. A study published this year by S&D Coffee & Tea shows that on average, younger millennials start drinking coffee at age 15, while older millennials picked up the habit at 17. Typical members of Gen X, meanwhile, started drinking coffee at 19. More of us drink coffee regularly. U.S. coffee consumption rose 5% in 2013, according to a National Coffee Association survey, meaning that today 83% of the adult population drinks coffee; 75% have coffee at least once a week. And we\u2019re drinking higher-priced coffee at that. Data from 2014 shows that 34% of Americans drink gourmet coffee daily, an increase of 3% over last year. Young people in particular are willing to pay higher prices for coffee: In a new PayPal poll, 18% of people age 18 to 34 said they are willing to pay more than $3 per cup, compared with just 8% of those age 50 to 64. We eat breakfast outside the home more often. Our fast-moving, on-the-go culture has been blamed as a reason for declining sales of cereal and milk, as more Americans are skipping the traditional breakfast at home and opting for foods that can be eaten on the run, like Pop Tarts and fast food via the drive-thru. In fact, breakfast has become enormously important to quick-serve restaurants because it\u2019s the one mealtime experiencing strong growth lately. Coffee purchased at a restaurant or on the go at a convenience store or caf\u00e9 is always more expensive than coffee brewed and drunk at home. One word: Keurig. \u201cIn 2002, the average price of a coffee maker was about $35,\u201d a recent post at the Northwestern Kellogg School of Management blog stated. \u201cBy 2013, that number had risen to around $90.\u201d Truth be told, it\u2019s still easy to find a coffee maker for $35 or even less, it\u2019s just that the type of machine\u2014the traditional kind that brews ground coffee by the pot\u2014is no longer typical. It\u2019s been replaced by the pricier single-cup brewer that came into the mainstream over the last decade thanks to the Keurig company. For many consumers, the speed and convenience of such machines outweighs the premium one must pay beyond the plain old-fashioned coffee maker. Some 1.7 million single-cup Keurig brewers were sold in the second quarter of 2014, an increase of 200,000 over the same period a year before. Plus, K-Cups themselves are pricier. It\u2019s not just the single-cup machines that cost more\u2014the cups themselves do too. The price per single-serve K-Cup pod varies widely depending on the style of roast, whether you\u2019re buying a small pack or stocking up in bulk, and how strategically you shop for deals. But no matter how good you are at snagging deals, you\u2019ll almost always pay more for coffee pods than you will for old-fashioned ground or whole bean coffee. One price-comparison study conducted a couple of years ago indicated that K-Cup coffee cost more than $50 per pound, roughly four times the cost of a bag of Starbucks or Dunkin\u2019 Donuts beans. What\u2019s more, K-Cups are subject to a 9% across-the-board price hike in early November. (Side note: Mother Jones and others have pointed out that single-use K-Cups cost more and are worse for the environment than recyclable pod filters, though Keurig Green Mountain has plans to make all K-Cup pods fully recyclable by 2020.) All coffee is simply getting more expensive. A long-lasting drought in Brazil (the world\u2019s biggest producer of coffee beans) has pushed global coffee prices to near-record highs, and the market may be affected for years to come. Already this year, java junkies have faced price hikes from coffee brands such as Starbucks, Folgers, Maxwell House, and Dunkin\u2019 Donuts. Interestingly, even as coffee has gotten more expensive and economic growth hasn\u2019t exactly been sizzling in recent years, Starbucks sales have outpaced lower-priced competitors Dunkin\u2019 Donuts and McDonald\u2019s. What does that show us? For the most part, coffee lovers are passionate about their caffeinated beverages and aren\u2019t going to trade down to what they view as an inferior cup of Joe, even if doing so would save a couple of bucks here and there.",

        "article": "By Christopher Miller2014-02-21 20:09:05 UTC KIEV, Ukraine \u2014 In a move that elicited cheers outside on Independence Square and inside the Ukrainian Parliament, lawmakers on Friday voted to allow the release of imprisoned former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, an opposition leader and arch-rival of embattled President Viktor Yanukovych. The surprise vote came hours after Yanukovych and opposition leaders signed a deal aimed at defusing the three-month long anti-government protests. The agreement allows for early elections, reduces the powers of the president by restoring the country\u2019s 2004 constitution and creates a coalition government. A majority 310 members of parliament from all factions, including communists, voted in favor of the law which would free Tymoshenko. The move would decriminalize the article of the criminal code under which she was jailed in 2011 for abuse of office in a trial viewed by the West and Russia as politically motivated. The law now must be signed by the parliamentary speaker and the president for it to take effect. Taras Berezovets, a political consultant who once worked with Tymoshenko, said that Yanukovych has 15 days to sign the law. He said there is a chance Yanukovych will not sign the law. If that happens, Tymoshenko could still be released due to the 310 votes cast by deputies in favor of her release, which is enough to override a veto. Once the law is printed in the government newspaper, Holos Ukrainy, a Kiev court could order her release. While the former prime minister is a popular political figure and legally would be allowed to run for president in upcoming elections, some believe she is unlikely to participate, due to her poor health. She has suffered from back problems during her more than two years behind bars. She has asked the government of Ukraine to allow her to be sent to Germany for medical treatment on numerous occasions, but to no avail. Serhiy Vlasenko, her lawyer, told the Kyiv Post newspaper that she can hardly walk and will need months to rest upon her release. #Tymoshenko can be free in about 10 days, with zero criminal record. welcome her to the presidential candidates' club #Ukraine \u2014 Katya Gorchinskaya (@kgorchinskaya) February 21, 2014 Tymoshenko lost a presidential runoff against Yanukovych in 2010 by just 3.5 percentage points. Despite her ailing health, Berezovets, who worked with Tymosehnko from 2007-2010, believes the determined ex-premier will jump in the race. \u201cShe definitely will,\u201d he said. \u201cShe wants revenge. And she is the best candidate for this job.\u201d Timothy Ash, head of research for emerging markets at Standard Bank in London, called today's developments \u2013 reducing presidential powers and transferring them to the legislature; presidential elections by December and the release of Tymoshenko \u2013 as creating \"staggering momentum now in Ukraine.\" \"This will create some short term euphoria,\" Ash said. \"But Russia's reactions remains key and critical still. It seems evident that Western assistance will now be forthcoming for the new administration \u2013 they may even sign the association agreement and free trade agreement with the European Union.\" Christopher J.

        "article": "OPEC\u2019s move to cut output might be too late. After pumping full tilt for the past two years, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is weighing a plan to reduce production by up to 700,000 barrels a day later this year. But many analysts say the proposed reduction isn\u2019t big enough, nor will it happen quickly enough, to address a global supply glut that has kept oil prices low. Going into this year, many forecasters projected that supply and demand for crude would return to balance by the end of 2016. But even after OPEC\u2019s agreement, most now don\u2019t see a rebalancing until the middle of next year, or even later. Global inventories are near record levels, and OPEC has been outflanked by shale producers that have weathered oil\u2019s collapse and can boost output when prices rise. \u201cThe fast and nimble U.S. drillers have taken away some of OPEC\u2019s power,\u201d said Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of IHS Markit and a longtime oil-market watcher. \u201dNow there\u2019s a lot more oil that is not OPEC oil.\" OPEC reached a consensus on Wednesday to scale back production to between 32.5 million and 33 million barrels a day, down from 33.2 million barrels a day in August. The cartel said it would complete details at its November meeting. News of the proposal caught the market by surprise, sending U.S. crude prices up 8% over the last three days of the week to $48.24. Prices are up 30% this year, after falling below $30 to a 13-year low early in the year. It remains unclear which countries would cut and whose production numbers would be used as a reference point. OPEC members have a history of failing to comply with output quotas. Even if OPEC ratifies and enforces the agreement, many energy experts say the production cuts could have a limited impact on correcting the global supply imbalance. The glut reflects in part the changing roles of U.S. producers and OPEC, as shale drillers have gained market share and more power to influence global prices. \u201cOPEC does not control marginal production and therefore has no lasting control over prices,\u201d Commerzbank AG said in a research note on Thursday. Countries outside of OPEC now account for 58% of the world\u2019s total output, which in the second quarter ran at 95.9 million barrels a day, above estimated demand of 95.6 million barrels a day, according to the International Energy Agency. OPEC\u2019s proposed cuts would reduce the excess supply only if they weren\u2019t offset by gains in non-OPEC output. Even if the cuts were to bring global production back into line with consumption, inventory levels around the globe would remain high. In July, the most recent period for which data are available, stockpiles of crude oil and refined products held by countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development topped 3.1 billion barrels, up 15% from two years earlier, according to IEA data. Non-OECD stockpiles also stand near records, according to Bernstein Research estimates. \u201cAt the end of the day, it just comes down to very, very basic fundamentals: how much oil do you have in the system?\u201d said Joe Tanious, senior investment strategist at Bessemer Trust. \u201cYou want to see a drawdown of those inventories.\u201d Overall, non-OPEC production is expected to fall by more than 800,000 barrels a day this year, according to the IEA, but rise by nearly 400,000 barrels a day next year due to increased output from Canada, Russia and Brazil. Some investors say the consensus is too bearish and think the glut will ease. They note that companies have cut hundreds of billions of dollars in spending on oil and natural-gas production since 2014, and that 2017 might mark the first-ever third straight year of declining energy spending, according to the IEA. \u201cShale can turn on and off quickly, but the other 96% of the oil market cannot,\u201d said Robin Wehb\u00e9, portfolio director at Boston Company Asset Management, a unit of Bank of New York Mellon Corp. He said that an \u201cunprecedented starvation of capital for oil companies\u201d would slow output and lift prices in the coming years. But lower investment hasn\u2019t translated into lower production as quickly as many expected. Projects that were started years ago are still coming on line. Bernstein Research released a list last week of 136 offshore projects still under construction, some of which aren\u2019t expected to be complete until 2021. Output that has been disrupted for political reasons or other factors is also coming back as well. Iran\u2019s output in August was nearly 800,000 barrels a day above its average in 2015, when it was restricted by international sanctions, according to the IEA. That almost offsets a decline in U.S. output in the same period. Canadian production has rebounded following wildfires in May, and Nigeria and Libya could also increase production if unrest in those regions subsides. On the demand side, consumption has recently disappointed. Oil demand is expected to grow by a robust 1.3 million barrels a day this year, according to the IEA, but demand growth plunged in the third quarter due to \u201ca dramatic deceleration in China and India,\u201d the agency said. OPEC itself has contributed to the global glut by producing record levels of oil this summer. \u201cThe market has changed since June, and our expectations about the rebalancing process have shifted,\u201d OPEC President Mohammed bin Saleh al-Sada, who is Qatar\u2019s oil minister, said Wednesday. \u201cIt is evident that there is now a greater degree of urgency about ensuring the market returns to balance as quickly as possible.\u201d \u2014Georgi Kantchev and Benoit Faucon contributed to this article.

A new study by a company that routes thousands of these e-mails to Congress shows that plenty of constituent e-mails never reach lawmakers' offices. \"Citizens would be understandably upset if they knew that letters they sent through the U.S. Post Office were never delivered,\" writes Dennis W. Johnson, a George Washington University professor who oversaw the study for the e-mail company, Capitol Advantage. \"Unfortunately, there is strong evidence that much of the electronic mail that citizens assume is reaching Congress is ending up in an electronic trash can.\" Congress has had an e-mail problem for years. It is deluged with an estimated 200 million constituent messages annually, the vast majority of them electronic. The number is so large and is growing so quickly that lawmakers are desperate to find ways to throttle the volume. The number of e-mails has mushroomed in part because of the now-common practice among interest groups to rally their troops via cyberspace. Generally, a lobby will send an e-mail to its most eager members, which directs them to a Web site. Once there, the members fill out a form that routes to lawmakers e-mails that advocate whatever it is the group is pressing for at the moment. Lawmakers have come up with ingenious methods to undermine the effectiveness of such programs. As readers of this column know, some congressional offices are now insisting that would-be e-mailers solve a simple math problem (to prove they are real human beings and not some machine spamming them with the push of a button). Many offices are also demanding that constituents disclose what issue they want to communicate about and to reveal information about themselves: Zip code, street address, e-mail address, phone number and the like. Now we know that these efforts are working well. According to the Capitol Advantage study, six of the 10 leading companies that run Web sites that send e-mails for interest groups failed to deliver even half of those e-mails through their systems. That is a big disappointment. After all, aren't public officials supposed to be open to the public? The survey wasn't as comprehensive as I might have liked and the companies that set up the Web sites are disputing its findings. But its overall conclusion is difficult to contradict: Lobby organizations are having a hard time getting e-mail to Congress. \"There's a lot of resentment toward us on Capitol Hill,\" said Bill Pease, chief technology officer of GetActive Software Inc., a vendor of public policy programs for the Web. Lawmakers tend to think that e-mail communications and, in fact, almost all mass mailings are fake and can easily be disregarded, several executives said. To get around the hurdles, Web site operators have taken to faxing the e-mails to legislators. For example, the Business Industry Political Action Committee, or BIPAC, routinely faxes to Congress messages that started out as e-mails typed into its sites by constituents. So does Democracy Data & Communications LLC, which also runs regular hand deliveries to Capitol Hill so it can be doubly sure that messages reach targets. All of this, of course, is absurd. Electronic messages are being delivered on paper. Many of the missives that actually reach their targets are not accorded attention by the people who matter. Faxes, in particular, have low credibility with lawmakers. Which leads to the more interesting question: Can democracy be conducted through shortcuts? The Internet allows interest groups to mobilize their members with incredible ease and speed. Hundreds, even thousands of messages can be directed to individual lawmakers with a single, well-placed e-mail alert to trained zealots back home. Even with the obstacles placed in the way of these communications, e-mails roll into Congress at an amazing rate. So amazing, in fact, that it is possible that lawmakers have become inured to the sheer volume and have learned not to care as much about them. An earlier poll of congressional staffers, also underwritten by Capitol Advantage, touched on this. It discovered that half of the aides it surveyed thought the folks whose names were attached to the e-mails they receive aren't aware that the e-mails were sent to Capitol Hill. Another 25 percent of staffers questioned whether those communications were legitimate. That strikes me as the bigger issue: Not whether every e-mail is getting through to Congress but how many of them are being read with serious interest. I bet a closer look at that issue would be even more unsettling to Web site operators and their clients than the latest estimate of delivery rates. Qorvis Communications LLC has bought Sparky's Garage. No, the fast-growing public relations firm isn't going into the auto repair business. Sparky's Garage is a local advertising firm, and Qorvis has bought the seven-person shop in the belief that commercials will play an ever larger role in lobbying. But not just any commercials. \"A lot of issue advertising turns out to be very expensive memos to Congress or the administration,\" said Qorvis's Michael J. Petruzzello. \"And it's hard to quantify if it's reaching its target audience and whether it's effective.\" Sparky's Garage, now known as Qorvis Advertising, \"will bring a fresh approach to issue advertising,\" Petruzzello promised, by integrating its commercials with the Internet and grass-roots lobbying. And adding some pizzazz. The five-year-old ad agency's founder Bill Replogle (who called himself the chief mechanic) has worked on accounts that range from Harley-Davidson to the Washington Nationals. Those kind of clients don't normally cross paths with public policy types. But maybe the mixture will wake up the Washington wonks. That's what Qorvis is betting.

Before you spend the money, consider this: It might help you look a few years younger but not more attractive, a new study found. The study of 37 women and 12 men who underwent facial rejuvenation procedures like facelifts and eyelid lifts and found that plastic surgery shaved about three years off their perceived age. But it had no effect on their perceived attractiveness. \u201cThe drive to maintain a youthful appearance and attractiveness has been an important motivating factor leading patients to seek aesthetic facial surgery,\u201d the researchers wrote in their study, published today in the journal JAMA Facial Plastic Surgery. \u201cFrom this study, it seems that the attractiveness level will remain the same, regardless of age.\u201d Read about the fine line between therapeutic and cosmetic eyelid lifts. A group of 50 men and women was tasked with guessing the patients\u2019 ages and rating their attractiveness on a 10-point scale. As perceived age went up, attractiveness scores went down, according to the study. But those scores failed to improve with surgery. The authors theorized that attractiveness is intractably linked to perceived age. So when the patients looked younger post-surgery, their attractiveness score shifted down since they were being compared to younger people. In other words, the old adage \u201cyou look good for your age\u201d is only a factor when you know how old someone really is. \u201cBecause a person\u2019s age is perceived as younger following aging face surgery, his or her attractiveness level is also intuitively perceived to be better, commensurate with the apparent age reduction,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cAs long as a person ascribes a correct age to someone else, that person will perceive the other\u2019s attractiveness with his or her assigned age in mind.\u201d Read about how social media is spurring plastic surgery. Interestingly, female raters tended to ascribe higher attractiveness scores than male ones. And 75 percent of all of the raters\u2019 scores landed in the four-to-seven range, according to the authors. Americans underwent a whopping 1,594,526 cosmetic surgical procedures in 2012, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. And eyelid lifts were the third most common procedure, with some 204,000 recipients \u2013 more than 98,000 of them 55 and older. All in all, Americans spent more than $1.4 billion on facelifts and eyelid lifts last year, according to the ASPS. Was it worth it? Tell us what you think in the comments section!",

        "article": "That was two seasons ago. The Ozark Medieval Fortress, an attraction founded in 2010 but built with 13th-century methods for tourists, is now a ruin \u2014 at least financially. And its investors face a challenge perhaps even greater than building a castle by hand: trying to sell it. The castle opened as an exotic idea imported from France. Tourists paid to step back in time, mingle with laborers in tunics and observe medieval tools and techniques. At stations surrounding the work site, they tried carving stone, making rope and forging iron. A human-scale hamster wheel powered a crane for heavy lifting. Artisans baked medieval bread, mead not provided. \u201cLots of people know about the medieval but never see a castle,\u201d said Jean-Marc Mirat, 73, one of the founders. \u201cTo build one here, I think the idea is pretty good.\u201d Situated on a mountainside, the castle was to rise 45 feet, complete with a drawbridge and a working farm, by the end of its 20-year construction schedule. But in January last year, besieged by market forces, the Ozark Medieval Fortress succumbed. Today, the limestone walls stand unfinished, ranging from 2 to 15 feet high. A rope flutters from a slumping catapult. Rodents are using the toolbox in the stone-carving station as a throne, so to speak. \u201cWe have many ideas, but no money,\u201d Mr. Mirat said. \u201cThis is hard to do.\u201d The investors, 15 French citizens including Mr. Mirat and his wife, Solange, sank $1.7 million into the project. Their asking price: $400,000. Still, potential buyers are not storming the walls. In fact, no one knows how to even find any. \u201cIf I seem baffled, I suppose I am,\u201d said Mr. Mirat\u2019s real estate agent, Roger Turner of Re/Max. He listed the site on his company\u2019s Web site and a few others, but \u201cI don\u2019t think the individual interested in this type of property is looking on remax.com,\u201d he admitted. The initial investment is not the main obstacle, Mr. Turner said. \u201cYou have to have a broad enough vision of what you would do with it,\u201d he said. The original vision came from Michel Guyot, the Frenchman behind just such a castle in the Burgundy region of France. That castle-in-the-making, Gu\u00e9delon, has drawn tourists from around the world, including the Mirats, who make annual trips back to France from their home in Arkansas. The couple retired here more than two decades ago to be near their daughter, Flavie, who lives outside Branson, Mo., with her American husband and children. Seeing Gu\u00e9delon in 2008 inspired Mr. Mirat to create a New World version of the castle on his land. Revenue would come from some of the eight million annual visitors to Branson, which is 30 miles north of the Mirats\u2019 1,000 acres of nearly pristine Ozark mountainside and valley. He enlisted Mr. Guyot, who helped create a limited liability corporation of French investors who contributed an initial $1.5 million \u2014 money that was nearly gone by the time the land was cleared and a parking lot and a welcome center were created. Nevertheless, after its debut in May 2010, the castle garnered national headlines and a visit by Larry the Cable Guy for his show \u201cOnly in America.\u201d Investors expected 150,000 paying tourists that first year. Just 12,000 showed up. In 2011, the castle slashed its payroll and increased the admission fee to $18 from $12 per adult. Tourism dropped still lower, and visitors complained of insufficient personnel. The castle offered neither food nor beverages to weary travelers, and the nearest restaurant was 12 miles away. Meanwhile, the site manager returned to France for personal matters. She was not replaced. Many investors never visited, and the languishing project closed before the 2012 season. Jean Revault d\u2019Allonnes, an investor who still believes in the castle\u2019s viability, said in an e-mail that it \u201cwas underfunded from the beginning,\u201d particularly its advertising budget. Many of the investors \u201care not familiar with American culture and language,\u201d he wrote, \u201cand they tried to impose decisions from France without hearing American advice.\u201d Mr. Mirat said that despite living next to the fortress, he was powerless to take control. \u201cI was just the observer looking at the site going down, down, down,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is heartbreaking for us.\u201d While Mr. Guyot and many other investors have written off the project, Mr. Mirat, Mr. d\u2019Allonnes and a few others hope to find a buyer who will invest in their vision. Mr. d\u2019Allonnes has drafted business plans. One would require $1.3 million to finance a restaurant, an R.V. park, a hotel and medieval attractions like apothecaries and the on-site fabrication of leather, soap, fabric and more. Mr. Turner has taken a handful of calls about the property; no one has the financing. He has spoken to developers in Branson; \u201cthey have a long-term game plan, and this isn\u2019t it,\u201d he said. Still, he has taken some interested parties to the site. They see the half-built towers, the smithy with a bellows large enough to blow over a child, the kiln and shattered pottery. They see the eerie human hamster wheel. And they might see someone tilting at windmills. Mr. Turner said some were \u201cinterested in the dream, but it\u2019s a little overwhelming. They don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d",

        "article": "T'S impossible to read the work of H. P. Lovecraft (1890-1937) without experiencing a familiar sensation. The throat constricts. The lips purse. A shudder goes through your body, and the hands rise involuntarily to the mouth. But all resistance is futile, and you must succumb -- to a profound case of the giggles. Of course, this is not the effect to which Lovecraft aspires. ''The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind,'' rumbles his famous credo, ''is fear,'' and the author intended from the very start -- his first story, completed when he was 14, was ''The Beast in the Cave'' -- to carry on in the grand literary tradition of making adults wonder if that slight creaking sound is the claw of some sinister beast finding its slimy way into, say, the walk-in closet in my bedroom. This is a fine tradition, and Lovecraft's shadow looms large in it. But like so many seminal influences -- modern practitioners, from Stephen King to Joyce Carol Oates, hail him as a crucial figure -- he's not read nearly as widely as he is regarded, and frankly it's not difficult to see why. Just as Oscar Wilde noted that ''one must have a heart of stone to read the death of Little Nell without laughing,'' it's tough to venture into a Lovecraft story with a straight face, let alone with chattering teeth. Lovecraft's stories are so overwrought that they make Jules Verne look like a homebody and Edgar Allan Poe a well-adjusted realist; he pushes at the already extreme boundaries of the Gothic, horror and science fiction genres -- not so much in the way that John Ashbery pushes at the boundaries of poetic form but more as Spinal Tap pushes at the boundaries of heavy metal: by turning the volume up to 11. A scientist in a tale by M. R. James might stumble into strange circumstances that grow more and more sinister; in Lovecraft's ''Statement of Randolph Carter'' he lowers himself into a forbidden crypt in the dead of night to discover the source of a ghastly noise. A Wilkie Collins character might find a curious document in a locked drawer; in Lovecraft's ''Dunwich Horror'' the document has been passed between various shadowy figures, all of whom were either driven to death via madness or, it can sometimes seem, vice versa. While watching a John Carpenter movie, you long to ask a character, ''Why are you going outside in your nightgown when you've heard there's a killer lurking nearby?'' In Lovecraft's ''Shadow Out of Time,'' you hardly know what to say to Nathaniel Wingate Peaslee, who is suffering from five years of amnesia due to a mental takeover by invisible beings from another, unearthly dimension. This unearthly dimension, appropriately, adds an unearthly dimension to Lovecraft's world. A good deal of space is devoted to concocting and exploring a mythology of his own devising, if ''mythology'' is indeed the term for something so utterly removed from quotidian reason. Whereas Bram Stoker and Poppy Z. Brite made hay with Transylvanian legends of yore, Lovecraft created a mythos out of whole cloth -- or, more precisely, whole fungus. Mi-Go, the Fungi of Yuggoth, is one of the slimier attractions in Lovecraft's Cthulhu mythos, named after Cthulhu, a sort of dragon-octopus-human combo who skulks around driving men mad. Mi-Go is one of the less maddening creatures in the world of Cthulhu, although Lovecraft's description is hardly reassuring: ''They were pinkish things about five feet long; with crustaceous bodies bearing vast pairs of dorsal fins or membraneous wings and several sets of articulated limbs, and with a sort of convoluted ellipsoid, covered with multitudes of very short antennae, where a head would ordinarily be.'' Passers-by are ''quite sure that they were not human, despite some superficial resemblances in size and general outline. Nor, said the witnesses, could they have been any kind of animal known to Vermont.'' I should say not. While the notion of an unseen world is hardly unique to Lovecraft -- fantasists from Coleridge to Rowling have enjoyed peeking under earthly rocks -- one can hardly imagine a universe more removed from our own than that of Cthulhu. Biologically impossible, logistically unplumbable and linguistically unpronounceable, it's a world that makes you want to lock up all the wardrobes rather than venturing inside them. It is little wonder that the scarred witnesses of Cthulhan excursions talk to us in language as unspeakably florid as the universe they're attempting to describe. Lovecraft's narrators are all desperate with misery, and it is worth quoting several of these hysterics as they begin their tales, to approximate the accumulated tone of so much hand-wringing:",

        "article": "WASHINGTON \u2014 IF the new Congress can agree on anything this year, it may well be the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal between the United States and 11 other countries throughout the Asia-Pacific region. Passions run high when it comes to trade deals these days, and the Obama administration is working hard to sell it to labor unions, which roundly oppose it. So far the pitch has been about what the deal, as written, will do to help the American economy \u2014 a pitch that hasn\u2019t won over many, on either side of the partisan divide. But there\u2019s one thing the administration can do that will both win over some opponents and address one of the biggest issues in global trade: add a chapter on currency manipulation. It is not unusual for countries to manage their exchange rate \u2014 the value of their currency relative to others \u2014 to make their exports cheap while making others\u2019 exports to them more expensive. This method has been used extensively by, among others, China, Japan, Malaysia and Singapore \u2014 aside from China, all signatories to the partnership. The American dollar is a prime target for these currency managers. First, the dollar is the global trading system\u2019s premier reserve currency, meaning dollars are freely traded and confidently accepted by international investors. And Americans are a highly acquisitive people \u2014 a nice way of saying we buy a lot of stuff. Consumer spending as a share of gross domestic product is about 70 percent here, 55 percent in Europe and 35 percent in China. We\u2019re steady customers for export-led economies. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that, until these exporters start buying dollars to raise the value of the dollar relative to their own currencies, thus subsidizing their exports and taxing their imports. In the United States, the result is persistent trade deficits that have been a drag on growth and jobs \u2014 better-than-average manufacturing jobs \u2014 for decades. In a compelling argument for including a chapter in the Trans-Pacific Partnership to restrict currency manipulation, C. Fred Bergsten of the Peterson Institute for International Economics estimated that America\u2019s trade deficit \u201chas averaged $200 billion to $500 billion per year higher as a result of the manipulation\u201d by the rest of the world, resulting in the loss of one million to five million jobs. The challenge is in the details. Countries buy foreign currencies for various reasons, not just to gain a trade advantage, and they shouldn\u2019t necessarily be held to account for doing so. Moreover, opponents of such a chapter argue that it would cover the actions of our own central bank, the Federal Reserve, and open it to charges that it also manipulates exchange rates. (When the Fed lowers the short-term interest rate, or engages in \u201cquantitative easing\u201d to lower longer-term rates, one clear consequence is to lower the value of the dollar.) But that argument doesn\u2019t quite hold. It\u2019s a matter of intent, and there is a clear test: whether the central bank is engaging in domestic demand management or currency management, and the simplest way to tell is to observe whether the bank is buying foreign currencies. The People\u2019s Bank of China does a great deal of that. Our Fed does almost none. It\u2019s important to recognize that deals like the Trans-Pacific Partnership are not necessarily about \u201cfree trade.\u201d They are instead a set of rules; some, like lowering tariffs, lead to freer trade, while others, like expanding patent protections, are more protectionist. Rules governing currency tactics certainly fit the framework. Some purchasing of foreign currency should be fine under the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Some developing economies collect dollars to cover their external debts in case of financial crises and large outflows of private capital. With this in mind, Mr. Bergsten suggests that holding enough foreign currency to cover a year\u2019s worth of external liabilities might be a sound benchmark; anything more would be questionable. Once we\u2019ve agreed on what currency management looks like, what actions would a chapter on it take? These could include a tax on the imports of offending countries, fines, the temporary canceling of certain trade privileges and my favorite, reciprocal currency intervention: If countries can go into currency markets and buy dollars, then we must be able to do the same with their currency. That\u2019s not currently possible with China and other countries, which use capital controls to block such large purchases. Speaking of China, even though it\u2019s not part of the partnership talks, rules like these, especially reciprocity, should be applied to it as well. Not to do so would put the signatory countries at a distinct disadvantage to a trade behemoth with a history of undervaluing its currency to maintain trade surpluses. As a White House economist in the first few years of the Obama administration, I learned that many of my colleagues shared my concerns about currency management. But all administrations believe the only way to do something about it is through quiet diplomacy. They believe that writing down rules in a trade agreement is too risky, with the potential to scuttle the whole deal. Diplomacy hasn\u2019t worked. A more direct approach is needed. If the trade deal\u2019s supporters want an agreement worthy of broad support, this is a chance they can\u2019t afford to miss.

        "article": "NSW Premier Mike Baird has slammed the sentence handed down to the man who admitted he helped cover up the murder of teacher Stephanie Scott. Marcus Stanford, 25, sold the popular 26-year-old's engagement and graduation rings after his twin brother Vincent raped and killed her on April 5 last year, a court was told yesterday. Mr Stanford was today convicted and sentenced to one year and three months in jail, meaning he will be eligible for release on September 9 considering time already served. Marcus Stanford (left) and his brother's murder victim Stephanie Scott. (AAP) Stephanie Scott's mother Merrilyn said 'there will be no end to the sorrow'. (9NEWS) The premier said sentences must reflect community expectations. \"The most horrendous crime deserves the most appropriate punishment,\" Mr Baird said in a press conference today. \"On the evidence I've seen, it doesn't seem appropriate. The Attorney-General is considering every possible avenue available to her. \u201cWhen there is a crime such as this, we need the appropriate justice, and certainly on what has been presented, that doesn\u2019t seem the case for me.\" Justice Robert Allan Hulme told the court Mr Stanford's act in disposing of the rings was \"utterly appalling, disgraceful and inexcusable\". \"It was the act of a man who put morality and human decency secondary to the interests of his murderous brother.\" According to crown facts, school cleaner Vincent Stanford attacked Ms Scott at the Leeton High School in the NSW Riverina region on Easter Sunday, less than a week before she was due to be married. While Ms Scott was ensuring lessons were in place ahead of her honeymoon, Vincent Stanford obtained a \"rape kit\" from his home. He dragged the young teacher into a store room, sexually assaulting her and stabbing her in the neck with a large knife. The killer later drove Ms Scott's car to a national park and placed tree branches over her naked body, pouring petrol onto them and setting her alight. He exchanged numerous SMS messages with his brother in South Australia, and posted Ms Scott's rings and driver's licence to him. \"I can only proceed on the basis that he knew Ms Scott had been abducted and murdered but not how, why or in what circumstances,\u201d Justice Hulme told the court in Leeton today. The judge went on to say the acts of Mr Stanford had little impact on the investigation and prosecution of his brother, as he had already been arrested when the rings were sold. \"The offender's motivation was, to use his term, misguided loyalty to his brother,\" the judge said. The rings, sold at an Adelaide jewellery store for $705, had become trophies, Ms Scott's mother Merrilyn told the NSW Supreme Court yesterday. \"The vision of them being removed from Stephanie's gentle, loving hands sickens us and fills us with despair,\" she read from a victim impact statement. Stephanie Scott was murdered just days before she was due to marry her long-term partner, Aaron Leeson-Woolley. (Supplied) Acknowledging Merrilyn Scott's statement, Justice Hulme said \"the horror of what confronted [Ms Scott's] family, friends and particularly her fianc\u00e9 Aaron at Easter last year and their enduring sense of loss, grief and despair is, as I observed, beyond comprehension. \"It is with regret that all I can offer is my most sincere sympathy.\" Marcus Stanford admitted being an accessory after the fact of murder. Vincent Stanford has admitted murdering and raping Ms Scott and faces a sentence hearing in October. \u00a9 Nine Digital Pty Ltd 2016",

        "article": "The Washington Times is looking for a new executive editor, and the job description seems to call for someone with almost superhuman qualities. The paper has hired a New York headhunting firm to search for a successor to Wesley Pruden, who has been editor in chief since 1992. The Times has made no secret of the fact that Pruden plans to step down in the coming months. One candidate is Managing Editor Fran Coombs, who has been interviewed for the job. The \"confidential position description,\" as crafted by the Howard-Sloan-Koller Group, calls for someone who can \"articulate and execute . . . the mission of the paper and Web site . . . Support and contribute to the strategic vision of the company . . . Serve as 'master' of the tone and voice for the paper and Web site . . . Maintain an awareness of and respond to market trends/needs identified through market research. Use Web analytics to measure success of Web content and modify approach accordingly . . . Build and maintain a collaborative and productive relationship with the President/Publisher regarding vision, mission, goals and objectives, while fostering church/state separation.\" Church/state separation -- which usually refers to a metaphorical wall between a newspaper's corporate side and its journalists -- may be more literal in this case than usual. The Times was founded, and is financially supported, by members of the Unification Church. Pruden is out of town and could not be reached. Times spokesman Brian Bauman said the recruitment firm was hired because the paper has \"a lot of positions to fill\" but that he could not discuss details because \"it's an internal matter.\" It is not clear, even to insiders, who will make the final decision. Douglas Joo, a former Times publisher, was named chairman of the paper in February, and Thomas McDevitt, a former Times marketing director who also worked for the Points of Light Foundation, was appointed president. In 2005, North Korean leader Kim Jong Il granted Joo an audience in Pyongyang. The four-page document says an ideal candidate would have \"national and international news experience; foreign reporting experience\" and a \"savvy understanding of the nuances of Washington, D.C. politics and culture as an ambassador of a news organization that moves in the power circles of government and business.\" Also desired: An \"ability to navigate inside-the-Beltway influences\" while approaching news \"from the perspective of an informed consumer with outside-the-Beltway interests.\" Not to mention a \"hands-on style with reporters balanced by rigorous experience managing relations with a global network of news sources.\" And a \"leadership ethic that inspires newsroom habits and practices resulting in efficiency, effectiveness and excellence,\" while -- of course -- nurturing \"a culture of innovation, creativity and excellence.\" Only a few bullet points hint at the fact that the Times is a self-described conservative newspaper. The new editor must have \"respect for the vision of the founder of News World Communications and The Washington Times, which aims to further the values of faith, family and freedom, while conveying a global awareness, urbanity and sensitivity.\" The founder, who is not named, is the Rev. Sun Myung Moon. The editor must also be \"comfortable with a center-right editorial page perspective.\" And appreciate \"the importance of America's prudent application of its economic, military and cultural power in a complicated world,\" along with an \"editorial mission that encompasses aggressive coverage of human rights globally and to advancing the cause of world peace.\" An e-mail seeking comment from Howard-Sloan-Koller was met with an enthusiastic response -- and a request for a r\u00c2\u00bfsum\u00c2\u00bf -- until it was made clear that the note was not a job application.",

        "article": "TOKYO\u2014Prime Minister Shinzo Abe made a significant stride toward his goal of expanding the role of Japan\u2019s military Thursday, as the main chamber of parliament passed a package of national security bills despite scant public support and doubts about its constitutionality. The passage of the bills enables Mr. Abe to make good on a promise he made to U.S. lawmakers to approve \u201cby this summer\u201d legislation that allows Japan to take on more responsibility under their bilateral security agreement. Citing heightened tensions in East Asia, the U.S. and Japan upgraded the guidelines to their security treaty during Mr. Abe\u2019s visit to Washington in April. Mr. Abe\u2019s ruling coalition, with a solid majority in parliament, pushed the bills through, brushing aside noisy protests from opposition lawmakers on the floor of parliament and large, daily demonstrations by Japanese citizens outside the building. \u201cThe security environment surrounding Japan continues to get tougher,\u201d Mr. Abe told reporters after the vote. \u201cThese are absolutely necessary bills in order to protect the lives of Japanese people and prevent wars.\u201d The bills will now be sent to the upper house of parliament, where opposition lawmakers plan to continue fighting them. But even if the legislation fails to gain approval there, Thursday\u2019s passage means it will automatically be sent back in 60 days to the more powerful lower house, which would have the final vote. The most contentious aspect of the legislation would allow Japanese troops to come to the rescue of allies under attack even if Japan itself hasn\u2019t been attacked. That involves reinterpreting Japan\u2019s pacifist constitution, which limits the military\u2019s role to self-defense. Members of opposition political parties, including the Democratic Party of Japan, the former ruling party, and the resurgent Japanese Communist Party, left the chamber before the vote. Calling the legislation a \u201cwar bill,\u201d Communist Party chief Kazuo Shii criticized the vote as \u201ca historic act of recklessness.\u201d Mr. Abe has criticized China\u2019s territorial ambitions in the South China Sea, and Tokyo and Beijing have a dispute over Japan-held islands in the East China Sea. The security legislation would bolster Japan\u2019s ability to aid U.S. forces in the event of a U.S.-China conflict in Asian waters \u2014 even through direct participation in the fighting, if Japan judged that its own territory was under grave threat. China on Thursday expressed skepticism about the legislation, describing it as \u201can unprecedented move since the Second World War.\u201d Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said, \u201cIt is fully justified to ask if Japan is going to give up its exclusively defense-oriented policy or change the path of peaceful development that has long been pursued.\u201d Still, relations have slightly thawed recently between Mr. Abe and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. A national-security aide to Mr. Abe was in Beijing on Thursday and conferred with a top Chinese official amid talk that the two leaders might meet in September. Polls have shown a majority of Japanese are against the defense bills, underscoring their attachment to the nation\u2019s pacifist constitution, which was written by U.S. occupation forces and has kept Japan out of war for nearly seven decades. A poll released Tuesday by the Asahi Shimbun daily found that 56% of respondents opposed the bills, compared with 26% supporting them. Mr. Abe\u2019s forceful push for the bills has weighed on the approval ratings for his cabinet as well. The Asahi survey found 42% expressing disapproval, compared with 39% voicing approval. Some legal scholars, including one expert who testified on behalf of Mr. Abe\u2019s party at parliament last month, have said the legislation, with its tolerance for the use of \u201ccollective self-defense,\u201d violates the constitution, which renounces \u201cthe threat or use of force\u201d to settle international disputes. \u2014Chun Han Wong contributed to this article.

        "article": "SEOUL, South Korea \u2013 North Korean leader Kim Jong Un recently ordered preparations for launching \"terror\" attacks on South Koreans, a top Seoul official said Thursday, as worries about the North grow after its recent nuclear test and rocket launch. In televised remarks, senior South Korean presidential official Kim Sung-woo said North Korea's spy agency has begun work to implement Kim Jong Un's order to \"muster anti-South terror capabilities that can pose a direct threat to our lives and security.\" He said the possibility of North Korean attacks \"is increasing more than ever\" and asked for quick passage of an anti-terror bill in parliament. North Korea has a history of attacks on South Korea, such as the 2010 shelling on an island that killed four South Koreans and the 1987 bombing of a South Korean passenger plane that killed all 115 people on board. But it is impossible to independently confirm claims about any such attack preparations. The South Korean presidential official did not say where the latest information came from. Earlier Thursday, Seoul's National Intelligence Service briefed ruling Saenuri Party members on a similar assessment on North Korea's attack preparations, according to one of the party officials who attended the private meeting. During the briefing, the NIS, citing studies on past North Korean provocations and other unspecified assessments, said the attacks could target anti-Pyongyang activists, defectors and government officials in South Korea, the party official said requesting anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak to media publicly. Attacks on subways, shopping malls and other public places could also happen, he said. The official quoted the NIS as saying North Korea could launch poisoning attacks on the activists and defectors, or lure them to China where they would be kidnapped. The Saenuri official refused to say whether the briefing discussed how the information was obtained. The NIS, which has a mixed record on predicting developments in North Korea, said it could not confirm its reported assessment. The standoff with North Korea is not expected to ease soon, as Seoul and Washington are discussing deploying a sophisticated U.S. missile defense system in South Korea that Pyongyang warns would be a source of regional tension. The allies also say their annual springtime military drills will be the largest ever. South Korea's defense minister said Thursday that about 15,000 U.S. troops will take part, double of the number Washington normally sends. The North says the drills are preparation for a northward invasion. Seoul defense officials also said that they began preliminary talks on Feb. 7 with the United States on deploying the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense, the same day North Korea conducted what it said was a satellite launch but is condemned by Seoul and Washington as a banned test of missile technology. The talks are aimed at working out details for formal missile deployment talks, such as who'll represent each side, according to Seoul's Defense Ministry. The deployment is opposed by China and Russia too. Opponents say the system could help U.S. radar spot missiles in other countries. The United States on Wednesday flew four stealth F-22 fighter jets over South Korea and reaffirmed it maintains an \"ironclad commitment\" to the defense of its Asian ally. Last month, it sent a nuclear-capable B-52 bomber to South Korea following the North's fourth nuclear test. Foreign analysts say the North's rocket launch and nuclear test put the country further along it its quest for a nuclear-armed missile that could reach the U.S. mainland.",

        "article": "Robert King for The New York Times Clarence D. Mumford Sr. at his lawyer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office last month. He pleaded guilty on Friday to two counts from a federal indictment. MEMPHIS \u2014 In the end, it was a pink baseball cap that revealed an audacious test-cheating scheme in three Southern states that spanned at least 15 years. Test proctors at Arkansas State University spotted a woman wearing the cap while taking a national teacher certification exam under one name on a morning in June 2009 and then under another name that afternoon. A supervisor soon discovered that at least two other impersonators had registered for tests that day. Ensuing investigations ultimately led to Clarence D. Mumford Sr., 59, who pleaded guilty on Friday to charges that accused him of being the cheating ring\u2019s mastermind during a 23-year career in Memphis as a teacher, assistant principal and guidance counselor. Federal prosecutors had indicted him on 63 counts, including mail and wire fraud and identify theft. They said he doctored driver\u2019s licenses, pressured teachers to lie to the authorities and collected at least $125,000 from teachers and prospective teachers in Arkansas, Mississippi and Tennessee who feared that they could not pass the certification exams on their own. Mr. Mumford pleaded guilty to two counts of the indictment, just a week after he rejected a settlement offer. At the time, he said that its recommended sentence of 9 to 11 years was \u201ctoo long a time and too severe\u201d; the new settlement carries a maximum sentence of 7 years. Mr. Mumford appeared in Federal District Court here on Friday wearing a dark suit and a matching yellow tie and pocket handkerchief. He said little more than \u201cYes, sir\u201d in answer to questions from Judge John T. Fowlkes. Another 36 people, most of them teachers from Arkansas, Mississippi and Tennessee, have been swept up in the federal dragnet, including Clarence Mumford Jr., Mr. Mumford\u2019s son, and Cedrick Wilson, a former wide receiver for the Pittsburgh Steelers. (Mr. Wilson paid $2,500 for someone to take a certification exam for physical education teachers, according to court documents.) In addition to the senior Mr. Mumford, eight people have pleaded guilty to charges stemming from the investigation into the ring, and on Friday, a federal prosecutor, John Fabian, announced that 18 people who confessed to paying Mr. Mumford to arrange test-takers for them had been barred from teaching for five years. The case has rattled Memphis at a tumultuous time. The city\u2019s schools are merging with the suburban district in surrounding Shelby County, exposing simmering tensions over race and economic disparity. The state has also designated 68 schools in the city as among the lowest-performing campuses in Tennessee, and is gradually handing control of some of them to charter operators and other groups. And with a $90 million grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the district is overhauling how it recruits, evaluates and pays teachers. District officials say that the test scandal does not reflect broader problems, and that none of the indicted teachers still work in the Memphis schools. (At least one teacher is working in Mississippi.) \u201cIt would be unfair to let what may be 50, 60 or 100 teachers who did some wrong stain the good work of the large number of teachers and administrators who get up every day and go by the book,\u201d said Dorsey Hopson, the general counsel for Memphis City Schools who this week was named the district\u2019s interim superintendent. \u201cA teacher\u2019s job is very hard. I know it is,\u201d said Threeshea Robinson, a mother who waited last week to pick up her son, a fourth grader at Raleigh-Bartlett Meadows Elementary School, where a teacher who has pleaded guilty taught until last fall. \u201cBut I would not want a doctor who did not pass all his tests operating on me.\u201d The tests involved are known as Praxis exams, and more than 300,000 were administered last year by the nonprofit Educational Testing Service for people pursuing teaching licenses or new credentials in specific subjects like biology or history. By and large, they are considered easy hurdles to clear. In Tennessee, for example, 97 percent of those who took the exams in the 2010-11 school year passed. Robert Schaeffer, the public education director of FairTest, the National Center for Fair and Open Testing, said that the testing service had had problems with cheating before. Ray Nicosia, the executive director of the testing service\u2019s Office of Testing Integrity, said episodes of impersonation were rare. \u201cMore than 99 percent of the people take the test honestly with no problems at all,\u201d he said. In the case of the Mumford ring, the testing service spent a year conducting an inquiry before turning over its information to the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, which worked with the Secret Service and referred the case to Edward W. Stanton III, the United States attorney for the Western District of Tennessee. According to court documents, Mr. Mumford began soliciting teachers to take the Praxis exams for others in 1995, and continued to do so until at least 2010, when he retired from the Memphis schools and went to work as a guidance counselor at a small district in Arkansas. He paid the teachers from $200 to $1,000 per test. In Friday\u2019s hearing, Mr. Fabian said one client who paid Mr. Mumford $6,000 for multiple exams never got a successful result. Mr. Mumford\u2019s personnel file in Memphis, which was reviewed by The New York Times, shows that he received above-average performance ratings. Not long after he began hiring the test-takers, a mother accused him of abusing her son with a paddle. (Corporal punishment is legal in Tennessee.) Mr. Mumford was suspended without pay for two years until a judge cleared him of the abuse charges, and he returned to Memphis as a guidance counselor in 1999. He applied for several jobs as a principal \u2014 describing himself in cover letters, misspellings and all, as an \u201cexperienced school administerator\u201d \u2014 but he never rose any higher in the ranks.

Silver was referring to the so-called blue wall \u2014 states that have reliably voted for Democrats in the past several election cycles \u2014 and other states which have solidly been in Clinton's court throughout the cycle.

(Photo via REUTERS/Adam Bettcher) Specifically, Silver pointed to New Hampshire where polls have increasingly narrowed. Three polls released on Thursday showed Donald Trump at least tied with Clinton in the Granite State. \"If Clinton lost New Hampshire but won her other firewall states, each candidate would finish with 269 electoral votes, taking the election to the House of Representatives,\" he noted. Silver added that if Trump managed to win the 2nd Congressional District in Maine, the Republican presidential nominee would emerge as the winner of the Electoral College, 270-268. The statistician also highlighted the tightening of polls in Michigan and Pennsylvania. A Friday Michigan poll, for instance, conducted by a Republican research firm, found Trump and Clinton tied at 44%, and other polls have shown a closer race there in recent days. Those polls jived with other national and battleground polls that have been released over the past week. Clinton's strong lead slipped after the FBI announced that it had reactivated its investigation into her private email server. Election Day is on Tuesday. FiveThirtyEight's \"polls-plus\" forecast Friday gave Clinton about a 65% chance of winning: More from Business Insider: Nate Silver on Hillary Clinton's email revelations: Wiener is such a 'tragicomic figure... he could insulate Clinton' CLINTON: Trump is 'making up lies' about FBI's renewed investigation into my emails Hillary Clinton recited Jay Z's lyrics at a campaign concert in Cleveland",

        "article": "Gjon Mili, one of the first photographers to use the electronic flash to capture people and things that move too fast for the naked eye, died of pneumonia Tuesday at the Courtland Gardens Convalescent Home in Stamford, Conn. He was 79 years old and had lived in Manhattan. Mr. Mili, a longtime contributor to Life magazine, began using the electronic flash in 1937. With it, he would freeze an instant of action in a photograph or, with a rapid series of successive flashes, make a friezelike study of successive phases of the same action. It was with a series of flashes, called stroboscopic photography, that he created his version of the Duchamps painting ''Nude Descending a Staircase.'' He made similar stroboscopic photographs of a pitcher letting fly a knuckle ball and of a ballet dancer in motion. He is perhaps best known for a photograph of Lindy dancers in midair and one of Pablo Picasso as he sketched a figure in the air with a pen light. 'The Definitive Picture' Gene Thornton, reviewing a 1980 retrospective of Mr. Mili's works in The New York Times, said: ''During his long connection with Life, Mili was best known for his sharply focused stopmotion photographs of people and things that moved too fast to be seen by the unaided eye. The viewer often felt that Mili's photograph was the definitive picture of a particular action.'' The French photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson, commenting on Mr. Mili's work, said, ''I admire his sense of economy, his respect for craftmanship and his distaste for pretensions.'' Mr. Mili was born in Albania in 1904 and immigrated to the United States in 1923 to study electrical engineering at the Massaschusetts Institute of Technology. He received an engineering degree from the university in 1927 and worked on lighting research with the Westinghouse Lamp Company until 1937. 'Advancing by Leaps and Bounds' In a 1977 interview, Mr. Mili described his life after leaving M.I.T. ''After graduating I took many photographs as an amateur while doing research in lighting to earn a living,'' he said. ''It was 10 years before I was able to profit materially from my photographic efforts.'' ''With the advent of high speed electronic flash units, I turned professional,'' he added. ''My generation came at a time when photography was advancing by leaps and bounds, creating the impulse to experiment and to seek new approaches.'' Mr. Mili first learned of the electronic flash in 1937 when he met the man who developed it, Prof. Harold E. Edgerton of M.I.T. Mr. Mili began experimenting with the strobe in a studio he set up in a deserted church in Montclair, N.J. He quit Westinghouse when his photographs of the tennis player Bobby Riggs were published in Life. Mr. Mili kept an office in the Time & Life Building until he died. After Life folded in December 1972, he continued shooting photographs for special editions of the magazine. In 1978, his work began appearing in the new Life magazine. At Life, Mr. Mili photographed dancers, actors, jazz musicians and athletes. His photographs are collectted in several books, including, ''Gjon Mili: Photographs and Recollections,'' ''Photographs of Picasso,'' ''The Magic of Opera'' and ''Picasso et la Troisi eme Dimension.'' Mr. Mili is survived by a brother and a sister who live in Bucharest, Rumania. Services will be held at the Frank E. Campbell funeral home at 81st Street and Madison Avenue at 1 P.M. on Friday. A memorial service is being planned. photo of work by Mili; photo of Gjon Mili",

        "article": "\u201cReputation is important to me, whether it\u2019s about fighting for human rights, fair labour standards or sustainability,\u201d said Ballantyne, who is simultaneously getting a master\u2019s degree from the university\u2019s School of Natural Resources and Environment. To join a company like BP or Exxon, \u201cI would really have to feel that I could be a change agent from inside.\u201d For her 2014 summer internship , Ballantyne turned down an offer from Ford Motor Co that paid twice as much as the job she accepted at a Detroit nonprofit organisation. She wants to help the nonprofit create a business model for sustainable operations, which she believes will be more rewarding than working for the automaker. Many students, especially women, say they want to join well-regarded organisations where their work will benefit society and the environment. But faced with student loans and other financial responsibilities, not all can be as choosey as Ballantyne. Yet as the employment market improves, corporate reputation could become a deciding factor for more job seekers. About 60% of employed women consider it very important to work for a company that prioritises social and environmental responsibility, compared with 38% of men, according to a 2012 study by the nonprofit group Net Impact and Rutgers University. What\u2019s more, 30% of working women said they would take a pay cut for a job that makes an impact, compared with 19% of men. Erin Geoffroy is among those who would sacrifice money for a meaningful career. \u201cI have turned down recruiters from consumer-packaged-goods companies because I didn\u2019t feel their values aligned with mine,\u201d said Geoffroy, an MBA student and president of the Net Impact chapter at the University of Georgia. \u201cI don\u2019t want to work for a company that has only one team focused on corporate social responsibility and hasn\u2019t made it part of major business functions like marketing.\u201d Other research also indicates that women are more concerned than men about an ethical workplace. In a recent academic study, women showed less interest than men when given job descriptions that required ethical compromises. \u201cWomen didn\u2019t even want to apply when the job posting said they had to do whatever it takes to make money, but they were as interested as men when the posting said they should do the right thing in morally questionable situations,\u201d said Laura Kray, a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California at Berkeley and co-author of the study. Financial-services firms and oil companies face the greatest resistance from millennials, who were born in the 1980s and 1990s. About 22% of women and 20% of men in the millennial generation said they would avoid financial services solely because of its image, while 17% of women and about 11% of men felt the same way about oil and gas companies, according to a 2011 study of millennials in 75 countries by accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers. A separate survey this year found banking and energy significantly less appealing to women than men in the US, Canada, UK, Germany, France and Italy. But women were nearly as interested as men in the energy industry in Russia, India and Brazil, and even more drawn to banking than men in China, India and Japan, according to the study by Universum, a research and consulting firm that asked undergraduate business students to list their industry preferences. Some researchers are skeptical of the many surveys showing that corporate reputation significantly influences people\u2019s career decisions. They argue that people\u2019s behaviour often doesn\u2019t square with their survey responses and that reputation is just one of many factors job candidates consider. In an Australian study that asked participants to make choices between hypothetical job contracts, the researchers determined that fundamental features such as compensation and time demands mattered more than corporate reputation. \u201cYou need a good enough reputation because reputation is part of people\u2019s decision calculus,\u201d said Timothy Devinney, a professor at Leeds University Business School in the UK and co-author of the Australian study. \u201cPeople may not want to work for evil companies, but they don\u2019t need a superior reputation\u201d to attract employees. Indeed, some energy companies and banks say they are recruiting many students despite their industries\u2019 tainted reputations. Royal Dutch Shell seeks to hire more than 1,000 graduates globally each year and typically fills at least 95% of the jobs, a spokesman said. \u201cIn our campus recruitment road shows, we highlight the full range of activities that Shell undertakes and, of course, address any issues, including reputational ones, which may be raised.\u201d Even if graduates end up working for companies they don\u2019t admire, they needn\u2019t abandon their aspirations to make the world a better place. They can try to influence their employer\u2019s policies on social responsibility, sustainability and ethics, or they can take the business skills they develop to other more respected organisations. \u201cI don\u2019t want anyone to sell their soul, but I tell women to be open to companies they might be skeptical about,\u201d said Elissa Sangster, executive director of the Fort\u00e9 Foundation, a consortium of companies and business schools that aims to develop more women leaders. \u201cThey can get great training and experience at some major corporations to take to a nonprofit as either an executive or a board member. They can also put their own money \u2014 or the company\u2019s money \u2014 into organisations that support the issues they feel passionate about.\u201d Sangster is concerned that women will too easily walk away from industries with tarnished reputations, such as investment banking, where they might have a positive impact. \u201cThose companies need more women to help provide balance in decision making and risk taking,\u201d she said. \u201cThat could go a long way toward making the businesses more responsible and improving their image.\u201d To comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.",

These two bigots recently spewed racial hatred: Bundy suggesting that African-Americans might do well to consider slavery over freedom, and Sterling offering disjointed comments that reveal his evident beliefs in white supremacy. Bundy is a Nevada rancher who became a hero to the right for standing up to the heavy hand of federal suppression of property rights in the West. He and his family had been grazing their cattle on land they thought was theirs or the state of Nevada\u2019s for more than 100 years when along came the federal Bureau of Land Management (BLM), which claimed the land and assessed Bundy for his use of it. A federal judge upheld the claims and the million-dollar assessment; yet Bundy refused to pay. Instead of filing the judgment in a courthouse, as you and I would do if we had a judgment against Bundy, the feds showed up with 200 camouflage-clad machine gun-bearing federal agents determined to steal Bundy\u2019s cattle. Soon, thousands of Nevadans showed up to support Bundy, whereupon the feds enacted a \u201cfree speech zone.\u201d They ordered the protesters either to disperse, or to enter the zone and protest there. The zone was a 25-square-yard patch of earth in the Nevada desert, three miles from the Bundy/BLM confrontation site. Sterling is a billionaire who owns the Los Angeles Clippers of the National Basketball Association (NBA) and was a hero to the left for his public support of liberal causes. He has given generously to the Los Angeles chapter of the NAACP and to the Democratic Party in California. He is white, married and apparently enjoys the company of a biracial girlfriend. Recordings of his several wild, weird, disjointed rants directed to the girlfriend and uttered in the privacy of his own home have been played publicly. In them, Sterling directs his girlfriend not to attend Clipper games in the company of her African-American friends. Both of these men used hateful and hurtful words that were animated by truly condemnable attitudes about race. No moral person credibly could suggest that slavery is preferable to freedom, and no moral person credibly could suggest that whites are superior to blacks in any respect. Those were attitudes advanced by antebellum slave owners and 20th-century supporters of laws that used the machinery of government to harm blacks during the 100 years following the Civil War. All rational people, understanding the colorblindness of the natural law, have a moral obligation -- but not a legal one -- to publicly to treat persons of different races with equal dignity and respect. I can morally prefer a friend or a mate who is of my race, but I cannot morally hate a potential friend or mate just because the person is not of my race. I do not know what is in their hearts, but Bundy and Sterling are apparently haters. What to do with them because of their speech? Nothing. I mean nothing. Racially hateful speech is protected from government interference by the First Amendment, which largely was written to protect hateful speech. Neither Bundy nor Sterling has been accused in these instances of racially motivated conduct -- just speech animated by hatred. In the Bundy case, the feds did suppress speech by keeping it three miles away from them. Free speech, assembly and the right to petition the government would become empty and meaningless if the governmental targets of the speech and assembly could not hear it. The First Amendment will condone outlawing the use of a bullhorn by protesters in front of a hospital at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning. But it will not condone free speech zones for the sake of government convenience. The entire United States of America is a free speech zone. In Sterling\u2019s case, is it fair to punish someone for speech uttered in the privacy of his home? It would be exquisitely unfair for the government to do so, but the NBA is not the government. When Sterling bought his basketball team, he agreed to accept punishment for conduct unbecoming a team owner or conduct detrimental to the sport. Is speech conduct? For constitutional purposes, it is not; the Constitution does not restrain the NBA. It is free to pull the trigger of punishment to which Sterling consented. But it needn\u2019t do so. Hateful and hurtful words have natural and probable consequences where the people are free to counter them. The government has no business cleansing the public marketplace of hateful ideas. The most effective equalizer for hatred is the free market. It will remedy Sterling\u2019s hatred far more effectively than the NBA can. As advertisers and sponsors and fans desert Sterling-owned properties, he will be forced to sell them, lest his financial losses become catastrophic. And it has removed Bundy from the public stage altogether. But don\u2019t hold your breath waiting for the forces of freedom to nullify hatred. Soon the forces of darkness will attempt to do so as creative prosecutors and hungry litigators bring the government into the fray. I hope they stay home and follow the natural law principle of subsidiarity, which mandates that public problems be solved using the minimum force necessary, not the maximum force possible -- and no force at all where peaceful measures are just as effective. I would not invite Bundy or Sterling into my home, nor would I befriend them. But I will defend with zeal and diligence their constitutional freedoms. Andrew P.

        "article": "HOUSTON \u2014 To those who concede that the Republican nominee, Donald J. Trump, is not entirely prepared for the presidency but argue that he would \u2014 of course! \u2014 surround himself with admirable advisers, I have one name for you: Sid Miller. A few weeks ago, Mr. Trump tapped him to be an agricultural adviser to his campaign. Mr. Miller is in good company, with the likes of Gov. Sam Brownback of Kansas, former Gov. Rick Perry of Texas \u2014 soon to be a \u201cDancing With the Stars\u201d two-stepper \u2014 and Texas\u2019 official cowboy poet, Red Steagall. If you live outside Texas, you are probably unfamiliar with Mr. Miller, who is the state\u2019s agriculture commissioner. Within Texas, he is recognizable as one of those folks who keeps our infamous stereotype alive, against the best efforts of new Texas ambassadors like Beyonc\u00e9 and those wonky, presentable Castro twins, Juli\u00e1n and Joaquin. Mr. Miller, at 61, is weathered, blue-eyed and beefy, a classic backslapping good ole West Texas boy. He favors a wide-brimmed, white-as-snow cowboy hat and pointed boots. A former Baptist, he is today an elder in the Cowboy Church of Erath County. The United States Calf Roping Association named him a world champion in 2004. You get the idea. The right-leaning Mr. Miller spent 12 years in the Texas House of Representatives. After losing his seat in 2012, he rose, phoenix-like, to be elected agriculture commissioner in 2014. The work of hard-rock musician Ted Nugent as his campaign treasurer certainly helped. Despite the obvious contrasts, the West Texas rodeo star and the New York real estate magnate may have more in common than you\u2019d think. Mr. Trump likes to live in luxury; so does Mr. Miller. He furnished his new commissioner\u2019s office with $55,000 worth of Texana and taxidermy, courtesy of his contributors. The result, according to The Texas Observer, looked \u201clike the set of a John Wayne movie directed by Lars von Trier.\u201d You can\u2019t say he didn\u2019t share the largess with his staff. A newly elected commissioner, Mr. Miller didn\u2019t post all job openings among his staff and filled several positions with friends and campaign team members. And he gave out more in bonuses in his first nine months in office \u2014 $413,700 to 144 employees \u2014 than his predecessor had in more than two years. One person Mr. Miller hired, at $180,000 a year, has a conviction for abuse of campaign funds. Mr. Miller\u2019s own financial affairs have drawn scrutiny. The Dallas Morning News reported that he invested $97,000 of campaign contributions in stocks; then he used the proceeds to pay himself back for loans he\u2019d made to his campaign fund \u2014 without recording these transfers in his final campaign finance reports. In 2015, Mr. Miller used campaign funds to travel to Mississippi for a rodeo. In another case that year, Mr. Miller took a taxpayer-funded trip that he said was to visit lawmakers in Oklahoma, but was also to visit a practitioner known as Dr. Mike for an injection known as the \u201cJesus shot\u201d that supposedly takes away pain for life. Mr. Miller and Mr. Trump also share an aversion to \u201cpolitical correctness.\u201d \u201cIf one more person says \u2018Happy Holidays\u2019 to me I just might slap them,\u201d he wrote on Facebook last December. \u201cEither tell me \u2018Merry Christmas\u2019 or just don\u2019t say anything.\u201d As agriculture commissioner, he created the \u201ccupcake amnesty\u201d to defend parents\u2019 right to send their kids to school with sugary confections. He also welcomed deep fryers and soft drinks back to Texas schools, where they had been banned for a decade because of soaring obesity rates. \u201cWe\u2019ve been raising big, strapping, healthy young kids here in Texas nearly 200 years,\u201d Mr. Miller declared. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t need Washington, D.C., telling us how to do it.\u201d Mr. Miller was also the author of a Texas House bill requiring women to have a sonogram 24 hours before an abortion and to listen to the fetal heartbeat, accompanied by a doctor\u2019s narration: an approach that some people, like Mr. Trump, might welcome as a \u201cpunishment\u201d for women seeking abortions. Mr. Miller doesn\u2019t see it that way, of course. \u201cI will continue fighting for innocent life and for the safety of women,\u201d he promised in June, when the United States Supreme Court eased some restrictions imposed by Texas\u2019 laws on abortion. And like Mr. Trump, Mr. Miller believes that Muslims belong anywhere but here. One of his Facebook posts suggested we make peace with the Muslim world as we did with Japan \u2014 by using the atomic bomb. In another post, Mr. Miller likened Syrian refugees to rattlesnakes. This is not a guy who is going to raise a stink about building a wall on the southern border \u2014 he\u2019s more likely to lasso illegal crossers with his own rope. Paid for by his campaign contributors, of course. Mimi Swartz, an executive editor at Texas Monthly, is a contributing opinion writer.

The pair saw themselves in the Dance Off for the third time against Olympian Greg Rutherford and partner Natalie Lowe. The couples were neck-and-neck on the judges\u2019 leaderboard after scoring 31, which saw them joint second last. Ed Balls and Katya Jones sat at the bottom after performing an entertaining salsa routine to Psy\u2019s Gangnam Style on Saturday night. They were sent sailing through to Blackpool by the public. Greg and Natalie performed their Paso Doble again to Tamacun by Rodrigo y Gabriela while Daisy and Aljaz danced their Salsa to \u2018Groove Is In The Heart\u2019 by Deee-Lite. Craig Revel Horwood and Darcey Bussell both chose to save Greg and Natalie while Bruno Tonioli saved Daisy and Alja\u017e. Craig claimed that Greg and Natalie \u201cabsolutely nailed the dance this time round\u201d while Darcey said that they had more \u201cdynamic effect\u201d.

        "article": "After seven years spent overhauling the Blackstone Group\u2019s IT infrastructure, Harry Moseley has stepped down as CIO of the investment company, CIO Journal has learned. Moseley, who also has held technology leadership roles at UBS and Credit Suisse, told CIO Journal on Friday that he left Blackstone during the month of March. He said that he had achieved his goals and that he was ready to move on. Moseley said he hadn\u2019t decided what his next job or project would be. Seven years is a relatively long tenure for a CIO, a job that generally last around four years \u2014 a reflection of intense pressure that many CIOs face. Also, some highly sought after CIOs increasingly are inclined to spend a few years implementing major changes for an organization, then turn over the day-to-day operation of the new infrastructure to someone else. Moseley said he dramatically expanded the IT capabilities at Blackstone\u2013and that the technology has helped Blackstone grow. During the last seven years, Blackstone has evolved from a private equity firm into a financial institution with operations in private equity, hedge funds, real estate, restructuring and advisory work. The company also went public during Moseley\u2019s tenure. \u201cSuffice it to say that the investments in technology saw significant returns from the operations, risk mitigation, quality improvement and an efficiency perspective. Typically, those are huge productivity gains. However, in the alternative investment management business they are just massive,\u201d Moseley said. When he arrived seven years ago, the Blackstone technology platform was composed of voice, email and Microsoft Office\u2013a very manually intensive operation. Since then, the firm has created an enterprise architecture that provides a framework for implementing new systems and business processes. Some of the numerous applications include a new fund and partnership accounting system, an enterprise data warehouse, a treasury management system, a client management system, and a portal for use by clients. A messaging system connects these platforms, so that information is entered at the source and distributed, eliminating the need to maintain redundant data. A site allows internal staff and clients to access their Blackstone data from a single data repository. Moseley said the web-based portal \u201chelped us scale the business.\u201d A new application allows the company to share documents with outside clients\u2013the document publishing platform encrypts the actual documents and provides full tracking through the use of digital rights management. \u201cWe could not have done it until we were confident those documents were secure,\u201d he said. Using this application, the firm can control how documents are shared, keep track of when they are read and even issue a remote self destruct order that makes it impossible for certain recipients to read a document, revoking their authorization. The system, developed by Watchdox (a vendor in which Blackstone has an equity investment) was deployed more widely in March. The fund accounting system boosted productivity, Moseley said. Instead of people having to manually enter data in a spreadsheet, the task is accomplished by an enterprise application. The process is significantly more efficient, less error prone and reduces risk associated with people having developed customized knowledge and \u201cpersonal\u201d processes that can be difficult to maintain if they leave the firm. Financial firms are making more and better use of technology for a variety of reasons, raising the importance of their CIOs. \u201cThe alternative investment management space has never been a high technology business, but with the onslaught of regulatory change, the need for more transparency and the need to gain greater efficiency, i.e., scale the operation, there has been a tremendous turn toward innovative technology in that sector. If you look at all the larger AIM firms they are all embracing technology in ways they have never considered previously\u201d Moseley said.",

        "article": "Drilling rig. (Image credit: Getty Images via @daylife) There are a few societal costs to the development of shale gas. Potential contamination of groundwater, complications in treating and recycling water used in fracking. Then there\u2019s air pollution from leaking methane (a potent greenhouse gas) and from the diesel-powered rigs and trucks involved in drilling. But all things considered the benefits of shale gas appear to outweigh the costs. Many utilities are finding that burning natural gas to generate electricity is cheaper (and cleaner) than coal. Cheaper supplies of fuel and feedstocks benefits U.S. industry, especially manufacturers and chemicals makers which have been reinvesting in the U.S. Homeowners benefit from cheaper heating and cooling and electricity. Drilling for gas has created hundreds of thousands of jobs during this economic malaise and it\u2019s generated billions of dollars of lease payments and royalties to landowners. A group of Yale economics graduates, many of them energy industry executives, led by Yale Professor Emeritus Paul W. MacAvoy, were curious about whether they could quantify the economic benefit that shale gas has on America. So they recently set out to do a cost-benefit analysis, valuing and balancing the pros against the cons. They\u2019ve released their findings in a paper called \u201cThe Arithmetic of Shale Gas.\u201d I\u2019ve parsed all the complicated academic equations so you don\u2019t have to. Their conclusion: the benefits of continued shale gas development are enormous and dramatically outweigh even worst-case scenario costs of pollution and clean-up. Some specifics. Consider that back in 2008, before the shale boom really took off, the nominal price of natural gas (that is, the price at the Henry Hub in Louisiana) averaged $7.97 per mcf. In 2011, the price averaged $3.95 per mcf. Multiply that price drop of $4.02 per mcf by the 25.6 trillion cubic feet the country consumed in 2008 and you find that thanks to the shale boom, America is paying $103 billion a year less for natural gas. (With gas prices falling even further since 2011, in 2012 the benefit will be even greater.) Had drillers not cracked the code on shale gas, the United States would instead have been forced to do what the experts expected five years ago: import massive quantities of gas, in the form of LNG from countries like Qatar, Australia, even Russia. Import-dependent nations like Japan and Korea pay upwards of $14 per mcf for LNG \u2014 more than triple U.S. prices. If the U.S. had to supplement domestic supplies with imports, the extra costs could have easily added $50 billion a year to the national natgas bill. As the report\u2019s authors write: \u201cIt is startling to acknowledge that consumer benefits from the technology of shale gas drilling and new gas production can be expected to exceed $100 billion per year, year in and year out, as long as present production rates are maintained.\u201d But it\u2019s not enough to just look at the benefits. What about the costs? The authors collected as many reports as they could find describing \u201caccidents, misuse of technology and poor well design and installation.\u201d A 2011 report for the Secretary of Energy counted 19 times that water from fracking operations spilled out of thousands of wells drilled. None of these instances included groundwater contamination. The Oklahoma Corporations Commission, which regulates the 100,000 oil and gas wells that have been hydraulically fractured in Oklahoma had zero documented instances of groundwater contamination. The EPA has reported two instances of groundwater contamination from fracking in Wyoming, though the agency has been roundly criticized for its methods. Despite any evidence showing that drilling and fracking cause spills or pollution with any frequency, the authors decided to calculate the costs for a scenario that assumes 100 spills a year out of 10,000 new wells drilled each year. They figure that if 5,000 gallons of polluted frack water were to spill into a field, the cost to scrape up a hypothetical 5,000 cubic yards of contaminated soil and dispose of it at an offsite landfill would be on the order of $2.5 million. Furthermore, if a potable water well were polluted by fracking, the cost to haul in a potable water supply and drill a new water well would be about $5,000. Given 100 incidents in a year, the clean-up costs associated with fracking accidents would be roughly $250 million.",

        "article": "Turkey's Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan has declared a three month long state of emergency. The swift measure is an attempt shore up last week's failed military coup and bring stability to the country. (Reuters) ANKARA, Turkey \u2014 Turkey declared a state of emergency on Wednesday, a move that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said would enable the state to act faster against those who plotted a failed coup. In a late-night televised address, Erdogan, who has been carrying out a large-scale purge of the country\u2019s institutions, sought to reassure the country that the measure \u2014 which would be in force for three months \u2014 will protect democratic freedoms. But the move consolidates more power in the president\u2019s hands, allowing him to rule by decree. For the state of emergency to be implemented, the decision must be approved by parliament. The United States and Europe have urged Turkey to follow the rule of law and maintain democratic order in the wake of the attempted power grab that saw a renegade part of the armed forces hijack aircraft and attack key military and government buildings last week. Turkey\u2019s countermeasures have affected more than 50,000 people \u2014 judges, civil servants, military, police and others \u2014 as the country\u2019s leaders seek to root out opponents and perceived internal dissent. The government is presenting the measures as an effort to confront a wide-ranging conspiracy led by a U.S.-based Turkish cleric, Fethullah Gulen, a former ally of Erdogan whom Turkey accuses of running a terrorist organization. Critics, however, claim that Erdogan\u2019s government is using the coup attempt as an excuse to eliminate the last vestiges of opposition to its rule. \u201cThe cleansing is continuing, and we remain very determined,\u201d Erdogan said. He described a \u201cvirus\u201d within the Turkish military and state institutions that had spread like \u201ccancer.\u201d [A family caught on both sides of the failed coup] Article 120 of the Turkish constitution allows for a state of emergency to be announced in the event of an act of violence intended to abolish democracy or cripple fundamental rights and freedoms, Erdogan said. The declaration will enable Turkey to \u201ctake the most efficient steps\u201d in order to remove threats to \u201cdemocracy, to the rule of law and to the freedoms of the citizens in our country,\u201d he said. The crackdown against alleged Gulenists has showed no signs of relenting and continued on Wednesday as Turkey issued a ban on professional travel for all academics, opened investigations into military courts and closed schools. At least 262 military judges and prosecutors were suspended as part of an investigation by the Defense Ministry into all personnel in its judiciary, the private NTV broadcaster reported. The Education Ministry said it was closing 626 private schools and other institutions that are under investigation for \u201ccrimes against the constitutional order,\u201d state-run Anadolu news agency reported. Almost a third of Turkey\u2019s top military generals have been charged in the coup plot. Turkish government officials have indicated that authorities may move to take more control over the armed forces. [An interview with Turkey\u2019s minister of foreign affairs] The military has long seen itself as the guardian of secularism in this mostly Muslim country and has staged a series of coups in past decades, but its power has been gradually diminished. Thousands of Turks took to the streets to prevent another coup, but the crackdown has raised fears that Erdogan \u2014 who described the plot as a \u201cgift from God\u201d \u2014 will use it as an opportunity to make the government more authoritarian. \u201cThe armed forces . . . will act in unison with the government,\u201d Erdogan said, hinting that civil control of the military \u2014 long a subject of debate in Turkey \u2014 could be expanded. According to a senior Turkish intelligence official, Turkish authorities have begun to arrest defense attaches stationed in several countries abroad who might have been involved with the attempted putsch. Analysts have raised fears that Erdogan may be moving toward establishing a one-party state. A Turkish intelligence official said he believes elements of the Gulen movement have infiltrated opposition political parties. According to the official, Turkish intelligence estimates that at least 100,000 people were involved in planning the coup. Gulen, the cleric accused of inspiring the coup attempt, has denied any link to the plot, implying instead that Erdogan staged it as part of a bid to consolidate power. Gulen lives in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania, and his backers operate education networks in Turkey, the United States and elsewhere. Turkey has requested Gulen\u2019s extradition from the United States. In Washington, Secretary of State John F. Kerry said the Justice Department has jurisdiction over the issue. \u201cThey will have to make their judgments applying our legal standards to whatever has been put forward,\u201d he said. The travel restrictions on educators officially apply to work-related trips, the state broadcaster TRT reported. \u201cThere are no restrictions to personal travel,\u201d said a senior Turkish official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with government protocol. He described the travel ban as a \u201ctemporary measure.\u201d [Thousands of judges purged in Turkey] But some professors and others in academic fields claim that their administrators have told them they cannot leave the country for any reason. Several university professors also confirmed that their supervisors told them to cancel vacations and other leave plans indefinitely.

        "article": "By Robert Duffer, Chicago Tribune One of the biggest numbers you see listed on the window sticker of a new car in a showroom is not the price. It's the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's fuel economy rating.Since 1977 the EPA has been encouraging fuel efficiency by listing its fuel economy metric as the most prominently featured number on window stickers. It's archaically known as the Monroney sticker after Sen. Mike Monroney, the Oklahoma Democrat who sponsored the Automobile Information Disclosure Act of 1958.Consumer demand and government mandates for fuel-efficient vehicles prompted the EPA to create a new fuel label in late 2010. The label is now required on all 2013 and subsequent models. The label includes a \"Fuel Economy & Greenhouse Gas Rating\" as well as estimated fuel costs and the amount you'll save or spend over five years \"compared to the average new vehicle\" in that class (subcompact car, midsize car, small SUV, minivan). For hybrids and plug-in hybrids (\"dual-fuel engines\"), the label provides an MPG and MPGe; for electric, hydrogen cell, and compressed natural gas engines, it is MPGe only.TESTSThe MPG/MPGe metric shows the combined value in simulated city and highway tests. Gas-powered vehicles get a higher MPG on the highway than in the city, especially if cruise control is set at a constant speed. Hybrids and electrics perform better in stop-and-go city conditions. The MPG rating is the average of the city and the highway tests. For 2008 models and later, the EPA added three tests for factors that drag down MPG \u2013 high speed, air conditioning and cold temperature. That gives the metric a more balanced, accurate value. The five tests are done at a controlled environment in Ann Arbor, Mich., called the National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL). Lab bays are more sophisticated versions of those inconvenient local EPA emission test sites. As comprehensive as the ratings appear, the EPA can only test 10 percent to 15 percent of all models in production. Manufactures submit their own test results, and we accept that the EPA's testing is good enough to keep manufacturers honest. Electrics (EV) and plug-in hyrbids (PHEV) are special, however: The EPA tests all new light-duty EVs and PHEVs to confirm the automakers' stats. MPGMPG means what it says: the average number of miles a vehicle will run on a gallon of gas. The lowest reported MPGs are between 10 and 12, ranging from high-performance sports cars to standard SUVs. The best performing hybrids can get up to 50, with plug-ins getting 58, according to the EPA; the best performing electric can get up to 120 (EPA testing as of 12/5/2012).MPGeThe equivalent is a little more complicated, unless you're good with stuff like physics and math.Since an alternatively fueled engine can't be measured by liquid gallons of gasoline, it is measured by the number of miles it can go using the same energy content as a gallon of gas. The EPA calculates that 33.7 kilowatt-hours (33,705 watts) of electricity is equivalent to one gallon of gas. This is a tricky apples-to-oranges conversion; for the formula used to convert all fuel types to a standard gallon measure, visit this page.A spokesperson for the EPA's Fuel Efficiency website summarized the MPGe testing this way: \"The EPA fully charges an EV and then lets it sit overnight. The following day the vehicle is driven through successive test cycles until it is no longer able to perform the test cycle. Then the vehicle is brought back to a fully charged state, and the energy used to recharge the vehicle is measured at the wall because that is the energy usage that will appear on the consumer's utility bill.\"So the MPGe indicates the number of miles driven over a single charge, converted into a gallon-equivalent ratio we mpg-lovers understand.COSTThe limitation, and criticism, of MPGe is that it it does not factor in how much it costs you to charge your car. There are two variables at play here: the cost of electricity, which is as variable as oil, and the amount of electricity it takes to charge the car. In our collective consciousness, the cost of gas is far more prevalent than the cost of electricity. The EPA added a small number on its label to show how much energy, either in gallons or kwh, it takes to go 100 miles. So to figure out how much it costs you to drive an electric, presuming you charge it at home, you'd have to multiply the kilowatts used to charge it by the cost of electricity.As of March 2013, the average cost of gas in Chicago was $3.98 (national average was $3.79). The average cost of electricity per kwh in Chicago was $0.148 (national average was $0.128, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics).For the gas-powered car on the label above, it would cost you 3.8 x $3.98 = $15.12 to drive 100 miles. (Average fuel economy is 24.6 miles per gallon, highest in history.)For the average electric of 33.7 kwh, it would cost you 33.7 x $0.148= $4.99 to drive 100 miles. (Electrics such as the 2013 Tesla Model S take38 kWh to get to 100 miles, some such as the 2013 Nissan Leaf take 29 kWh to get to 100 miles.)Despite the numbers, there is a lot of room for MPGe variances such as hills, wind, weather, use of air conditioning or added weight to the vehicle. The most important part of the numbers is the importance we're giving them.",

        "article": "Understanding how option prices change in response to changes in other variables can be tricky. The Greek (delta, gamma, theta, etc.) and pseudo-Greek (vega) names used to measure option sensitivities do not necessarily make things clearer. Options do, however, make intuitive sense if they can be viewed in an easily understood framework, such as basketball. Delta (Probability of an option finishing in the money) An option\u0092s delta is its most frequently observed characteristic. Delta is, strictly speaking, a hedge ratio, measuring the sensitivity of the option\u2019s price to very small changes in the price of the underlying instrument. But for most shorter-dated options it also approximates the likelihood that an option will finish its life \u201cin the money\u201d (e.g., that a call option will expire with the underlying asset at a higher price than the call\u0092s strike). A nearly exact analogy in a basketball game is the probability that one of the teams will win. Suppose Teams A and B are about to play and the game is considered a toss up. Before the game starts, each team has an equal chance of winning. With options, 50% is a typical delta for an at-the-money option with a relatively short term to expiration, say one month. The fact that the option is at the money (i.e., the underlying asset\u0092s price is equal to the option\u0092s strike price) is important for preserving the basketball analogy because each team is neither ahead nor behind, just as the option is neither in nor out of the money. Suppose now that in a game, Team A is a heavy favorite. It has a delta of, say, 80%. Since the game has not yet begun, we must still say that the option is at the money. How can an at-the-money option have such a high delta? It can if there is strong reason to believe the underlying asset will exceed the strike price at expiration (we will continue to use calls in our example, although the logic can also be used for puts). What might be the rationale for such a belief? Consider a ten-year at-the-money call option on an index of non-dividend-paying stocks. The opportunity cost of keeping money in stocks for this long a period is quite high: funds invested in low-risk securities could easily double because of compounding interest. Thus it doesn\u0092t seem reasonable to expect the stock index to have a lower nominal value at the end of the period than at the beginning. Just as Team A is heavily favored to beat Team B, a ten-year at-the-money call option is heavily favored to finish in-the-money. Consequently, the delta, or the approximate probability of the option being in the money, will be much greater than neutral (50%). Note that this logic clearly does not apply to short-term options, since their value is dictated by price moves over a handful of days, and the randomness of these moves will dominate the relatively minor amount of forgone interest income over such a short period of time. Gamma (Rate of change of the probability of an option expiring in the money) Suppose now that the basketball game between two equally matched teams is under way and one of the teams has taken a lead. It makes sense that the team in front now has a higher probability of winning than it did at the beginning of the game, and that the greater the team\u0092s lead, the more the odds have swung in its favor. Moving back to options, this is equivalent to a stock going up and raising the delta of what was originally an at-the-money call. But how much should the delta go up? In option language, this is measured by gamma, which is much higher as the option nears expiration than at the beginning of its life. But if this is Greek to you, go back to basketball! Let\u0092s look again at a basketball game where the teams are considered to have even odds. The game starts and Team A wins the jump ball and scores on a quick layup. It leads 2-0. Realistically, Team A has only a marginally higher chance of winning than it did before the game started. Perhaps now its delta is 51% instead of 50%. In other words, its gamma is 1%. Nothing significant has happened. But skip ahead to the last minute of the game. The score is tied 76-76 with just seconds to play. Each team\u0092s delta should be around 50%. When Team A scores right before the end of the game, its delta goes up from 50% to 98%, a much higher rate of increase, or gamma, than when it scored the first basket of the game. Of course, if the game had been one-sided throughout, with Team A dominating, the last basket before the buzzer would not affect the delta at all. This example shows how gamma is at its highest for near-the-money options approaching expiration. A single, favorable move in the underlying stock makes it almost certain to finish in-the-money, while an unfavorable move virtually guarantees it will expire worthless. On the other hand, using the basketball analogy, buying a long-dated option gives you the luxury of scoring your way out of a bad start. You still have plenty of time to catch up, just like holders of near-the-money Google put options do, even after last Friday\u2019s huge move!

        "article": "The Maastricht debt criterion governing a country\u2019s eligibility for joining the single currency was that the gross debt to GDP ratio was to be no higher than 60pc, or at least converging on 60pc \u201cat a satisfactory pace\u201d. Meanwhile, Gordon Brown set himself a tougher test. One of his fiscal rules said that the net debt ratio should be no higher than 40pc. Clearly, on either of these tests both countries have a significant debt problem. The French situation is worse, although not by a country mile. It is interesting to reflect on how the two countries got into their current positions. France has had a higher debt ratio than the UK for some time. As the Blair/Brown era began in the UK, and shortly afterwards the euro era began, France\u2019s net debt ratio was about 50pc, whereas the UK\u2019s was about 40pc. The French ratio then began a pretty relentless climb, whereas the UK\u2019s ratio plunged under the twin influences of New Labour\u2019s early fiscal restraint and a strongly growing economy. It reached a low point of just over 31pc in 2001, some 20pc below the French figure. This sort of gap was maintained until the financial crash of 2007/8 sent the economies of the world into a tailspin. The UK suffered particularly heavily. In 2009, the UK government\u2019s budget deficit was very nearly 11pc of GDP, its highest ever peacetime level, whereas the French equivalent was only just over 7pc. In both countries the deficit has since been reduced but in 2014 the UK\u2019s was still higher \u2013 about 5pc compared to France\u2019s 4pc. This year, the UK\u2019s deficit should be lower than the French one \u2013 although not by very much. This is hardly a tale of British fiscal probity versus French laxity. So why the gathering alarm about the French situation and the comparative insouciance about the UK\u2019s? And how has the UK\u2019s debt position deteriorated less than France\u2019s despite a higher deficit? As we keep hearing, \u201cit\u2019s the economy, stupid\u201d. For all the hullabaloo about fiscal austerity in the UK, a good portion of the reduction in our deficit has been due simply to the growth of the economy. Something similar has happened in France but the scale of their recovery has been much more modest. Since 2008, the UK economy has grown by 4.5pc whereas the French economy has grown by only 2.2pc. This not only explains why the UK\u2019s deficit has come down much faster but it also explains why its debt to GDP ratio has performed better than the French one, despite the UK running larger deficits. There is another wrinkle. Not only has the UK\u2019s real growth rate been higher than France\u2019s but it has also experienced slightly higher inflation. Now this is not always a good thing, of course, but inflation does have the virtue, other things equal, of reducing the government\u2019s debt ratio. Of course, the reasons for the UK\u2019s better economic performance are varied and complex. Despite some recent efforts at reform, the French economy is more sclerotic than the UK\u2019s. Accordingly, there is probably now a natural tendency towards French under-performance in almost all weathers. But in addition, the UK has operated its own monetary policy whereas France, subsumed within the euro, has not been able to. Looking forward, prospects for the public finances depend largely upon what happens to the economy. As things stand, it looks as though the UK will continue to outgrow France, and probably by a considerable margin. What\u2019s more, although the UK inflation rate was reported as zero last week, before long it will move up gradually towards the 2pc target. In France, the rate is likely to hover close to zero, dragged down by the huge weight of excess capacity. So the gap in GDP growth measured in money terms will be greater than the gap measured in real terms. Mr Hollande has also faced worries over the Greece crisis Not only will this mean that the UK\u2019s deficit will fall more rapidly than the French one but also that the ratio of debt to GDP will perform much better too. \u2022 Britain's bulging economy surges past France Indeed, it looks as though our debt to GDP ratio will fall this year. Phew! Over the next few years it will continue to decline \u2013 slowly but relentlessly. In France, by contrast, the ratio is still rising. And without either a burst of recession-inducing austerity or a surge in economic growth, neither of which looks likely, the ratio looks set to continue climbing. This lesson has applicability more generally. I am sure that many readers are heartily sick of the on/off Greek crisis. That\u2019s why I have decided to give you time off this week. Nevertheless, what happens to Greece remains vital to the future of Europe. The Franco-British experience shows what should have been obvious from umpteen other episodes around the world: you cannot cut your way to prosperity. To oblige Greece to engage in more austerity in current conditions is sheer madness. What it needs is more aggregate demand. Given this, the deficit will turn into surplus and the debt to GDP ratio will fall. Does anyone believe that the deal that seems to have been done to keep Greece in the euro will do anything to boost the Greek economy? If only the German economic establishment had read and understood Keynes. If it had accepted his ideas, Europe might have been spared his message being rammed home, not by words, but by bitter experience. - Roger Bootle is executive chairman of Capital Economics",

Those can just as easily be found online. E-commerce accounts for only 6 percent of total retail spending. But sales made on computers are growing much faster than sales in offline stores \u2014 and sales on mobile phones are growing faster still. Offline sales this holiday season have been forecast to grow about 4 percent from last year, according to the National Retail Federation. Desktop e-commerce sales will grow 13 percent and mobile sales 33 percent, predicted comScore. Already, many people use phones to research items, including while shopping in stores, even if they don\u2019t make the final purchase on a phone. There has been a spike in mobile shopping on Black Friday, as people in stores find better deals on their phones. For consumers, mobile commerce, like other mobile technology, is all about the push toward convenience. It\u2019s easier to get in a little shopping while you wait for the cranberries to boil or hide the fact that you are shopping during Thanksgiving dinner.

Holiday sales, in millions of dollars \u201cConvenience is what sells here,\u201d said Norman Sadeh, a professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University and director of its mobile commerce lab. \u201cThese cellphones are with us all the time, so why should you be doing Christmas shopping only at home? Why shouldn\u2019t you do it while you\u2019re on the subway, waiting for the bus, at the cafe?\u201d For retailers, mobile commerce is the latest example of how consumers\u2019 shift to mobile is catching businesses off guard. Retailers risk making the same mistake that other companies have \u2014 failing to keep up with consumers in making mobile shopping as easy as it is on a computer. To avoid that, more retailers are building mobile sites and apps. Apple Pay makes easier the biggest hurdle for many mobile shoppers \u2014 entering payment information on a tiny screen. And companies like Google are creating ways for retailers to track whether mobile shopping resulted in an offline sale. In recent years, Thanksgiving Day has rivaled Black Friday in retail sales, largely because of the surge in e-commerce. Last year, 21 percent of e-commerce sales on Black Friday were on phones, compared with 17 percent on Cyber Monday, when people were back at their desktop computers, comScore said. That implies that people are shopping on phones at times that they previously might not have shopped at all. The ability to shop anytime and anywhere might end up being a bigger threat to offline retailers than e-commerce has been.

Moore, a Texan, is a business consultant and principal at Big Bend Strategies. He is co-author of \"Bush's Brain: How Karl Rove Made George W. Bush Presidential\" and an on-air TV political analyst. (CNN) -- Bill and Hillary Clinton never fail to confound Americans. Their political and public service accomplishments often appear diminished by the stumbles in their private lives, real or imagined. No holder of high office, obviously, is ever judged simply for policy initiatives, and that seems especially true of the Clintons. As Hillary Clinton positions herself for a likely 2016 run for president, the scrutiny she will endure extends, inevitably, to her husband. Journalists and critics on the right will probably have to mine new material, however. What happened in Arkansas and the Oval Office have been more topically tortured than Benghazi. Fortunately, for the traffickers of faux outrage, the Clintons have offered up the Clinton Foundation, a ponderously complex institution that looks like it might be troubled by internecine squabbles, naked ambition, a touch of greed and an almost impossible to identify set of operational boundaries. Regardless of altruistic goals and achievements, the Clinton Foundation has blended friendships and political relationships along with corporate and nonprofit endeavors in a structure that will feed material into the Hannity-Limbaugh-O'Reilly GOP commentary complex through the next presidential election cycle. Clinton will likely not cross a room in the next few years without it being framed through the perspective of her unstated political plans to become president. News that she was moving with her staff into two floors of the Time-Life building, where the Clinton Foundation is located, may be a part of what prompted the New York Times to publish a detailed account of the nonprofit's operations and their possible implications for a second Clinton presidency. The former secretary of state is planning initiatives on jobs, women and children under the organization's new title of the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation, which, undoubtedly, will add to her already substantial resume. There are, of course, always legitimate questions for global nongovernmental organizations and potential conflicts between their programs and the profit motives of their large corporate donors. Increasing her association with the foundation means Clinton will be judged partly by the operational relationships of an institution that has previously been driven by her husband's global celebrity and fundraising skills. This is not a uniformly positive development. During her primary race against President Barack Obama, the Clinton Foundation ran a deficit of $40 million, possibly because its fundraising was competing with her campaign's. Even though the foundation and the associated Clinton Global Initiative and the Clinton Health Access Initiative had operating revenues of $214 million last year, it still ended with an $8 million deficit. The Clintons are either very astute at navigating the nether world between corporate millions and honorable charity work, or they are still dealing with the bedazzlement of wealth and power and haven't figured out how to clearly understand what is appropriate and ethical. The latter can hardly be argued. American presidential politics runs on the billions of multi-national businesses and winning elections is inextricably connected to finessing that dependency to give the converse appearance of independence. The Times report suggests the Clintons are still figuring this out, and regardless of any philanthropic motivations to help with global problems, they may be harmed by their institutional ineptitude. One example cited by The Times is a consultancy named Teneo, which was founded by a close associate of Bill Clinton. Monthly retainer fees were said to be up to $250,000 and the former president was a paid advisor, until the bad publicity and collapse of Jon Corzine's MF Global investment firm, a significant client. Hillary Clinton was reportedly angry about the negative media but it's unknown if she had previously commented or had ethical concerns regarding Teneo's recruitment of Clinton Foundation corporate donors to be clients. Surely, all of this is not without meaning? Well, maybe. The Clintons cannot be accused of not trying. Their political ambitions are as grand as their visions of global philanthropy. In just the 2013 meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative, public and private organizations made more than 70 commitments totaling $1.6 billion, estimated to impact about 2 million American lives. The Clinton Foundation has created significant partnerships around the planet to resolve issues related to health and wellness, economic inequality, climate change and childhood obesity. Execution in all of these endeavors has been, undoubtedly, imperfect, and, yes, Hillary Clinton's public evaluation as a presidential candidate may be connected to some of those shortcomings. But the greater failure would be to make no effort to help improve a troubled world. Perhaps the Clintons should simply return to Hope, Arkansas, rent a little house on a quiet side street and paint self-portrait watercolors. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.

Rush in a Democratic primary in 2000 \u2014 and that he had voted for Mr. Obama. \u201cAnd he had a funny joke,\u201d Mr. Gallego said of the president. \u201cHe was like, \u2018Oh. You\u2019re the one.\u2019 \u201d Mr. Gallego, 35, represents the Seventh District, which includes parts of Phoenix. In an interview, which has been edited and condensed below, he talked about life at Harvard (he was the first in his family to go to college), his tour in Iraq in the Marine Corps Reserve and how he met his wife at a fraternity date auction. Tell me about your childhood. We were poor. My mom and dad separated around 11. We started poor, then got to middle class and then went back to being poor. My mom was a secretary, which actually was very beneficial because I got to go to work with her and see lawyers, male lawyers. Growing up in an immigrant community, you don\u2019t get to meet other professionals, so it was great to go to work with her and see some of these guys in suits. Because the only time I saw guys in suits growing up was at funerals, or weddings. You ended up taking your mom\u2019s last name. Why? It\u2019s fairly traumatizing for a young man to lose what you thought was a father figure. And my mom and my grandfather really were the ones who stepped up. He basically taught me what it was to be a good person, a good man, and same with my mom. So, especially as I was going through college, and then serving in the military, I realized that my name should be attached to the persons that molded me. And when I finished my contract with the Marines, I went to the court and changed it. At Harvard, you worked on the \u201cdorm crew,\u201d which is basically a work-study job where you clean the rooms of other students. What was that like? It\u2019s a good job. I was getting paid $10 an hour, and if I timed it well, I could do about 20 hours per week. And, look, it\u2019s humbling. You\u2019ve got to go into other people\u2019s rooms \u2014 students you see in your classes \u2014 and you\u2019re there cleaning their toilets. Did your time in the Marines motivate you to get into politics? It was a combination of growing up the way I did, and then actually a lot of things that went wrong when I was in the Marines. The first casualty we took was on May 10, 2005, when I lost my best friend to an I.E.D. attack because we didn\u2019t have proper armor and we knew it. Our radios weren\u2019t working. It was just a bad situation. And then in early August we lost another group of Marines from my company. And then I got back from the war and people\u2019s G.I. Bills were screwed up. Some of us couldn\u2019t get into the V.A. So, all these things kind of just compounded and then eventually into politics. Minorities are a majority in your district. What would it take for Arizona to become a blue state? I\u2019ve always said we are the very, very cheap alternative to turning Texas blue. We have basically two media markets in two very dense metropolitan areas. I think it would take just a little, small investment of money. The Latino community is not going to naturally register itself and turn out itself. So if we wanted to be in play \u2014 and I think we can be in play \u2014 in 2016, we have to make the investment. Did anything about Air Force One impress you? Everything impressed me. A couple of days later, I was speaking at an M.L.K. event, and the one thing I thought was pretty cool was that on that plane there were two men from Chicago \u2014 two men of color from Chicago. And if 50 years ago you would have asked would an African-American and a Latino be on Air Force One, they would have said yes, but we would have probably been the valets. Your wife, Kate, is a Phoenix City Council member. And I hear you first met when she bid on you at a fraternity date auction in college. That\u2019s true! The guy who was supposed to get bid off that day didn\u2019t show up. So I got a call from my fraternity, like, \u201cHey, throw on a suit, get down there.\u201d So I rushed down. My friend for some reason leans over and says: \u201cYou should bid on Ruben. I know him. He\u2019s a really fun guy.\u201d And so Kate throws up her hand and bids on me, and then it gets bid up, bid up, bid up. Then she stopped, and I leaned over and nudged the moderator, and I was like, \u201cAsk one more time.\u201d So he said: \u201cKate, you bid earlier. Do you want to bid one more time?\u201d And she\u2019s like, \u201cI would, but I\u2019m out of money.\u201d And then I said, \u201cIf she bids one more, I\u2019ll pay half.\u201d And she agreed. So that\u2019s how it started. What was your final price? Forty-four dollars. This is in 2000 \u2014 in inflation dollars. That\u2019s pretty good.

        "article": "Science fiction movies are among the hardest and most expensive films to make in Hollywood. You need a big budget and a lot of people working on it. But not if you're Kaleb Lechowski. The 22-year-old German who studies digital film design made his own animated Hollywood-style sci-fi short \u2014 and now he's headed to Hollywood. Lechowski's film, titled R'ha, is a fully computer animated six-minute short that you won't believe was made by just one student. In R'ha, machines rebel against their rulers, an alien species, and force them out of their planet. The short starts with a robot interrogating one of the aliens after the Matrix-style insurrection. Perhaps R'ha's most original element is that there are no humans in sight. The story seems to be only about this alien race and their former servant robots who have turned on them. Despite being the work of a student, R'ha is so good it's already attracted the attention of Hollywood executives. After seeing Lechowski's creation online, Scott Glassgold, of the managing company IAM Sports & Entertainment, was impressed. \"His work is not only professional, it's extraordinary,\" Glassgold wrote Mashable in an email. \"There are shots in there that look like they are from a 150-million-dollar movie.\" Glassgold has experience with science fiction, he sold the shorts Rosa and True Skin to studios last year. Lechowski studies at the Berlin Mediadesign Hochschule. R'ha is his second big project at the school and his first animated 3D short. Lechowski told Mashable that he had the original idea for the story in the summer of 2011. Then, last semester, when he had to develop an animated 3D short for school, he decided he wanted to do a sci-fi video and use the idea he previously had developed. Inspired mostly by movies like Matrix and videogames like Half-Life, Lechowski is a big sci-fi fan. He wanted to create a science fiction short because he likes the freedom that the genre allows. In sci-fi \"you can create almost anything, like creatures, machines, you can create worlds, you can create basically everything,\" Lechowski told Mashable in a Skype interview. In 2011 he wrote down his ideas and when he started his school project he scribbled down some more ideas, doing drawings of the creatures he wanted to animate, and then he simply started working on his computer. Lechowski says he actually prefers to improvise directly with the program he uses rather than do too many drawings with pen and paper. Apart from having an actor doing the voices, and receiving help with the sound, he did it all by himself. Thanks to his impressive work, Lechowski is now headed to Hollywood. Glassgold, who acts as Lechowski's manager, got in touch with him and offered him a chance to pitch his short and his ideas as a full feature to movie producers. The manager thinks the movie has great potential, not only because of its technical excellence. \"After speaking with him, the world and universe that he has in mind for R'ha is groundbreaking,\" the Glassgold wrote. The German student will go to Hollywood in a few weeks to meet with executives and see if he can get the financing he needs to turn this into a movie. Lechowski and Glassgold declined to give more details about who they'll meet but Glassgold said they \"are already fielding offers and interest for a feature.\" Lechowski said he has some ideas on how to develop the movie, although obviously the rest of R'ha's story isn't decided yet. What he needs now is some help so he doesn't have to keep doing everything on his own, although he jokingly says that could do that too \u2014 with a considerable amount of time on his hands. \"It's just a question of time, I think,\" he says. \"If one would say I have 10 years of time to make a full feature out of it, I could do it my own, I guess. But that's not what I want to do.\" This wouldn't be the first time that a short becomes a full-featured successful movie. That's what happened with the critically acclaimed District 9, which was adapted from the short Alive in Joburg.",

On the strength of Andrew Luck\u2019s 293 passing yards and Stepfan Taylor\u2019s four rushing touchdowns, Stanford amassed 510 yards of offense. The Cardinal defense forced a turnover and snuffed out a third-quarter Arizona drive at the Stanford 6, while holding the Wildcats to half their scoring average. On the way to improving to 8-1, the Cardinal looked like arguably the best one-loss team in the land, its only defeat coming to conference rival Oregon, which is ranked No. 1. \u201cI told the team that I thought it was our most complete game,\u201d Coach Jim Harbaugh said. He added, \u201cI thought they played very smart, disciplined football.\u201d Perhaps because the Cardinal looked unstoppable, it was easy for Stanford fans to let their thoughts run away from them. The sign holder\u2019s thinking was transparent: If the Ducks win out and advance to the Bowl Championship Series title game in Glendale, Ariz., it will pave the way for the Cardinal to play in the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif. In fact, Stanford appears a more likely candidate for the Alamo Bowl. The Cardinal needs to win its final three games and have Oregon lose twice to win the conference and with it the automatic Rose Bowl bid, or hope a non-BCS team like Texas Christian or Boise State advances to play the Ducks for the championship. That would free the Rose Bowl from having to take a non-automatic qualifier if the Pacific-10 or Big Ten champion advances to the title game. If Stanford were to finish at 11-1, it would be in the mix for a B.C.S. at-large berth. The program\u2019s downside was evident to anybody who watched Saturday\u2019s national telecast. The attendance was announced as 43,506, but there were entire sections that were sparsely occupied. It was a reminder to the B.C.S. brass that the Cardinal does not have the most rabid following, no small consideration for bowl officials trying to fill stadiums at neutral sites. Asked what postseason game the Cardinal is playing for, Luck said: \u201cWe\u2019re not sure. We understand that the opportunities are there for Stanford. I know that there are many different situations out there for bowl games and whatnot. In the end, it doesn\u2019t matter unless we win. We\u2019re thinking like that.\u201d",

Nesbitt, whose identified in court records as a criminal street gang member, was sentenced Thursday to life in prison for the rape and murder of 100-year-old Martha Schell. He\u2019ll be eligible for parole in 23 years, Sedgwick County District Attorney Marc Bennett told the Wichita Eagle. If granted parole, he\u2019ll still serve another 26 1/2 years, which is the second portion of his sentence. Nesbitt\u2019s punishment comes nearly two years after Schell died. An autopsy revealed that she died of a blood clot that traveled to her lungs, the Wichita Eagle reported. Schell\u2019s death, according to court records obtained by The Washington Post, was caused by complications from injuries she suffered in the sexual assault. Police said Nesbitt broke into the elderly woman\u2019s Wichita home in September 2014. According to an affidavit, Schell went to her next-door neighbor\u2019s home that morning, wearing only a towel to cover her breasts. She was \u201cshaking and distressed,\u201d the neighbor told a Wichita detective. [A serial sex offender, out on probation, has been charged with rape for the fifth time] Schell was later taken to a local hospital. Confused about what happened, she told the detective that a man broke into her home and tried to rape her, the affidavit said. She remembered being thrown around and getting hit on the back of her head behind her ear, she told the officer. A test showed that Schell was indeed raped, as shown by significant injuries to her vaginal area, according to the affidavit. By analyzing DNA profiles from sperm cells collected from Schell, investigators found a match with Nesbitt, whose DNA profile was already in a local database. Schell, who remained hospitalized after the assault, died the following month. A jury convicted Nesbitt of felony murder, rape and aggravated burglary charges last month. He\u2019s filed a notice to appeal his conviction and sentence to the Kansas Supreme Court. Nesbit\u2019s criminal history stretches back to at least 1999, when he was 19, and includes several convictions on theft, burglary and criminal trespass, court records show. Elderly people account for only 3 percent of sexual assault victims, according to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network or RAINN. More than half of victims are between the ages of 18 and 34. Nearly 30 percent are between 35 and 64, while 15 percent are minors. Before her death, Schell was living a quiet and independent life in her home, using a walker to help her move around, Bennett told jurors last month, according to the Wichita Eagle. But the attack left her with a broken vertebrae and other injuries. \u201cThe next day and the rest of her life was consumed by pain,\u201d Bennett said, according to the paper. After Nesbitt was sentenced, Bennett told the paper that Schell\u2019s relatives are still grieving. [All-American swimmer found guilty of sexually assaulting unconscious woman on Stanford campus] \u201cNo one expects a 100-year-old family member to live forever,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cBut no one expects a 100-year-old family member to die like this.\u201d The victim\u2019s son, Kerin Schell of Wichita, declined to speak with The Post. Besides her son, Schell, a retired school board secretary, also left behind a daughter, two grandsons and one great-grandson, according to her obituary. \u201cRest in peace sweet and gentle lady,\u201d Gloria Gadomski wrote in the guest book. \u201cMay you be comforted in the knowledge that others share in your loss,\u201d Betty Washington wrote.

        "article": "Borrowing a trick from old media companies, Twitter is splurging for the rights to show NFL games to an audience of millions. To make its bet pay off, the company must use its time in the NFL's spotlight to lure more newcomers to Twitter. In the NFL's infinite quest to squeeze as much money as possible from large men in tight pants , it has been auctioning off the rights to show football games on TV and -- in a still novel development for pro football -- on the Web. As my Bloomberg News colleagues were first to report on Tuesday, Twitter emerged as the NFL's chosen spot for live Web streaming of 10 Thursday night games starting this fall after other interested companies like Facebook, Amazon and Verizon fell away. This means perhaps a couple million people will surge to Twitter each week to catch their favorite teams or to see Eli Manning's sad face for three hours. Change in Twitter's monthly users from 3Q to 4Q: Twitter is making a relatively small bet in the neighborhood of $10 million -- or something like 3 percent of its operating cash flow for last year -- for the NFL streaming rights. But for the investment to pay off, Twitter has to be focused on using the Klieg lights of NFL games to sell more people on why they should use and love Twitter. Twitter executive Adam Bain tweeted Tuesday that his company will be able to sell some of the advertising spots on the NFL Webcasts. That will be great for Twitter to increase its revenue and to cement the company's relationship with high-value marketing clients. But Twitter's problem has never been in the ad sales department, where the company is doing just peachy. Twitter's problem is not enough fresh faces are signing up and sticking with Twitter regularly, and it's not clear how the new NFL deal helps it there. The number of people using Twitter regularly is barely growing, even with lots of sports content on Twitter already. \"Monthly active users\" are people who use Twitter at least once a month, including through independent applications and SMS. Having a captive audience for three hours each Thursday is an alluring opportunity to turn many of those NFL viewers into loyal Twitter users. But Twitter must find smart ways in that weekly surge to hook people on its service. Otherwise that audience jolt won't do the company any long-term good. Building a bigger audience is CEO Jack Dorsey's top priority, and everything Twitter does must further that goal. The trouble is Twitter has a spotty track record of using sports to lure new users, even while Twitter remains a great place for sports fans to trash talk one another and catch highlights from games. Remember Twitter's effort to make itself a hub for water cooler conversation around the Olympics? No? Exactly. It flopped. The NFL and Twitter dropped a couple hints about how Twitter plans to stress its benefits to a new crop of NFL fans. In the news release about the Thursday night Webcasts, the NFL said there would be game highlights and \"pre-game Periscope broadcasts from players and teams, giving fans an immersive experience.\" It's not entirely clear how that would be much different from an existing collaboration between Twitter and the NFL that already results in tweets, photos and Web video from locker rooms and the field turning up on Twitter. All that NFL related content on Twitter hasn't been enough to lift Twitter's user numbers. The NFL charges a lot for the rights to air its games, and Twitter has a fraction of the cash flow of other football rights owners like CBS and NBC parent company Comcast. Fortunately for Twitter, the cost of its NFL bet is a drop in the bucket compared with what the TV poobahs are paying. CBS and NBC each agreed to pay about $225 million a year for the TV rights to Thursday NFL games over the next two football seasons, or about $45 million a pop for five games. Yahoo paid about $17 million to show a rather dull October match-up between the Bills and the Jaguars that started at breakfast time on Sunday for people on the East Coast. Re/code reported Twitter will pay less than $10 million in total to the NFL for the Web streaming rights. That's not exactly chump change for a company whose cash from operations was $383 million last year, but it's a relatively cheap ticket for a chance to sit in the NFL owners' skybox. Now Twitter better make sure to take advantage of its time in the cushy seats. I love football. As a Cincinnati Bengals fan, every season ends in heartbreak. Or maybe fewer. The NFL has said Thursday night football games on CBS and the NFL Network cable channel averaged 13 million viewers last year. No doubt a fraction of that audience will opt to watch the games on the Web as opposed to TV. Slate's Will Oremus said Twitter offered less money than other bidders for the NFL streaming rights, but Twitter was more willing to agree to the NFL's terms, including allowing the TV partners to control the majority of the ad spots online.

        "article": "A Neanderthal woman who lived and died in a Siberian cave 50,000 years ago has led researchers to the oldest known case of sex between modern humans and their beefy, thick-browed cousins. Tests revealed that the female, whose remains were recovered from the Altai mountains on the Russia-Mongolia border, carried traces of DNA from Homo sapiens who appear to have mated with her ancestors 100,000 years ago. The discovery pushes back - by tens of millennia - the date of the first known couplings between the two groups, and shows that both Neanderthals and modern humans inherited DNA from the prehistoric trysts. Researchers have known since 2010 that people alive today carry as much as 4% Neanderthal DNA. The genetic legacy, which may affect human immune systems, and the risk of depression and even nicotine addiction, is a smoking gun for interbreeding that took place after modern humans left Africa 60,000 years ago and met up with the Neanderthals. The latest study is the first to ask whether the archaic genes flowed in both directions. It finds that while European Neanderthals bore no traces of modern human DNA, the Altai Neanderthal did. The scientists narrowed the suspects down to early human pioneers who left Africa about 40,000 years before the great migration that saw humans colonise the world. Their adventure was not entirely successful: like the Neanderthals, they appear eventually to have died out. \u201cAn early modern human population left Africa much earlier than had been shown before and met with Neanderthals, possibly those moving from Europe towards the East, some time around 100,000 years ago,\u201d said Sergi Castellano, who led the study at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany. Related: Fifth of Neanderthals' genetic code lives on in modern humans Writing in the journal, Nature, the researchers describe how they compared complete and partial Neanderthal genomes with those from modern Africans who do not carry Neanderthal DNA. They found no trace of modern human DNA in Neanderthals from Spain or Croatia, but the Altai Neanderthal had strands of DNA that closely matched those of the modern Africans. One strand of modern human DNA found in the Altai Neanderthal involved a gene called FOXP2 which has been linked to language development, but Castellano said it was too early to say whether Neanderthals benefited from the DNA. Modern humans evolved in Africa about 200,000 years ago. When they left the continent for the north, they encountered Neanderthals who had already settled in Europe and Asia and adapted to the cooler temperatures, lack of sunlight, and different diseases. The interbreeding swapped genes among the two groups. Scientists have other evidence that Homo sapiens left Africa early but failed to establish themselves beyond the continent. They have recovered 100,000-year-old modern human skeletons from the Skhul and Qafzeh caves in Israel. Meanwhile, a set of 47 modern human teeth found in a cave in southern China was recently dated to at least 80,000 years old. \u201cNot only is this the first evidence of modern human DNA entering Neanderthal populations, rather than the reverse process, but this is also a separate and much earlier interbreeding than the one placed at 60,000 years onwards,\u201d said Chris Stringer, head of human origins at the Natural History Museum in London. He said that the interbreeding could have occurred anywhere in southern Asia. \u201cDoes this change the view that the pre-60,000 year old modern human dispersals failed? If both the early modern human groups and the early intermixed Neanderthals went completely extinct, then this was still ultimately a failed expansion,\u201d he added. Related: Why did the Neanderthals die out? Stringer said scientists cannot say whether the sex took place in peaceful relationships, or whether the groups stole each other\u2019s women, or whether abandoned or orphaned babies from one group were adopted by the other. Adam Siepel, a senior author on the study at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York, said: \u201cBecause children typically stay with their mother, it may suggest that this was a case where a human man mated with a Neanderthal woman, and then she raised the child in her Neanderthal community, into which it was successfully integrated enough to mate itself. \u201cAn alternative, and perhaps slightly less likely, scenario would have a Neanderthal man and a human woman mating and integrating as a family into a Neanderthal community \u2014 perhaps by coercion or perhaps not,\u201d he said.",

        "article": "NYPD Officer Anthony Francavilla has been accused of falsey arresting two black men on different occasions in New York. David Owens (r.) was busted by Francavilla and spent six weeks at Rikers, only to be released over a lack of evidence. The subway rider who sent David Owens to rot in Rikers for six weeks by claiming he swiped her backpack was not an intoxicated white woman, a police source claimed Tuesday. The female victim was black and simply \u201cvery tired,\u201d the source told the Daily News. In his lawsuit filed Monday in Manhattan Federal Court, Owens described the complaining witness as a white woman who was \u201cerratic, possibly intoxicated and definitely hysterical.\u201d His complaint said she had to be \u201cphysically held up\u201d by officers so she could keep her balance as she falsely identified him as the hoodie-clad black man she saw running up the stairs in an A/C/E train station at 2:28 a.m. on Oct. 23, 2012. Police officials have yet to respond to disturbing allegations that transit cop Anthony Francavilla plucked Owens off an uptown No. 1 train about an hour after the alleged theft because he fit the vague description of a black male wearing a hoodie. The News tracked down Evan King, 27, who settled a lawsuit against the city last year after the same cop allegedly roughed him up. NYC MAN WAS ARRESTED, THROWN IN RIKERS FOR 6 WEEKS IN 2012 JUST BECAUSE HE FIT VAGUE DESCRIPTION OF BLACK THEFT SUSPECT: LAWSUIT \u201cI know not all cops are bad,\u201d the computer technician told The News on Tuesday. \u201cI know it\u2019s especially frustrating for them that there are people like Francavilla making them look bad.\u201d In Owens\u2019 complaint, he said he was still working his job as a stock clerk at Macy\u2019s Herald Square at the time of the alleged backpack theft and tried to show Francavilla his timecard receipt, which showed he clocked out at 3 a.m. Owens, 23, also gave officers the name and phone number of his Macy\u2019s supervisor, but Francavilla \u201cignored him\u201d and instead signed an affidavit based on the woman\u2019s identification, the complaint states. Owens\u2019 lawyer said his client remembers the accuser as a white woman, but he never saw her again because he got sucked into the bowels of Rikers until his case was dropped without a grand jury proceeding. He spent the month and a half at Rikers, unable to make his $3,550 bail. He was released when prosecutors conceded they had no case, his complaint states. \u201cI just hoped and prayed I wouldn\u2019t get killed in there, and I would be able to tell my story so other people wouldn\u2019t have to go through what I did,\u201d Owens, who now lives in Augusta, Ga., told The News. His lawsuit names the city of New York and Officer Francavilla as defendants and seeks punitive damages. Francavilla has faced two similar lawsuits in Manhattan federal court in recent years. He was sued in 2011 by Kevin Walker, a black man, who said Francavilla ordered him off a D train in March 2010 and called him \u201cghetto trash\u201d when he asked for a reason. Walker was arrested for resisting arrest, but prosecutors dismissed the case. His lawsuit was settled for $2,500. \u201cHe was in his 20s, had no criminal history and was working two jobs to help support his family when he was targeted,\u201d Walker\u2019s lawyer Anthony Cecutti told The News. \u201cHe was emotionally traumatized and thought the officer crossed the line. It was racial profiling, and it was wrong.\u201d Francavilla was sued again last year after he arrested King, a Brooklyn resident who was pulled off a train at Columbus Circle after watching a Los Angeles Clippers game with pals. In his lawsuit, King claimed Francavilla called him a \u201cd--k,\u201d body slammed him and suggested he take his own life when he dared to ask why he was being detained. The false arrest, excessive force and false imprisonment lawsuit was settled for $30,000 in December 2014. An NYPD spokesman said the department could not comment on pending litigation. In 2006, Francavilla received a Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Association \u201cFinest of the Finest\u201d award after apprehending four suspects in an armed robbery. With Ryan Sit, Shayna Jacobs",

        "article": "Before the discovery of Australia, Europeans thought that all swans were white, and it would have been considered completely unreasonable to imagine swans of any other color. The first sighting of a black swan in Australia, where black swans are, in fact, rather common, shattered that notion. The moral of this story is that there are exceptions out there, hidden away from our eyes and imagination, waiting to be discovered by complete accident. What I call a \u201cBlack Swan\u201d is an exceptional unpredictable event that, unlike the bird, carries a huge impact. It\u2019s impossible for the editors of Forbes.com to predict who will change the world, because major changes are Black Swans, the result of accidents and luck. But we do know who society\u2019s winners will be: those who are prepared to face Black Swans, to be exposed to them, to recognize them when they show up and to rigorously exploit them. Things, it turns out, are all too often discovered by accident\u2013but we don\u2019t see that when we look at history in our rear-view mirrors. The technologies that run the world today (like the Internet, the computer and the laser) are not used in the way intended by those who invented them. Even academics are starting to realize that a considerable component of medical discovery comes from the fringes, where people find what they are not exactly looking for. It is not just that hypertension drugs led to Viagra or that angiogenesis drugs led to the treatment of macular degeneration, but that even discoveries we claim come from research are themselves highly accidental. They are the result of undirected tinkering narrated after the fact, when it is dressed up as controlled research. The high rate of failure in scientific research should be sufficient to convince us of the lack of effectiveness in its design. If the success rate of directed research is very low, though, it is true that the more we search, the more likely we are to find things \u201cby accident,\u201d outside the original plan. Only a disproportionately minute number of discoveries traditionally came from directed academic research. What academia seems more masterful at is public relations and fundraising. This is good news\u2013for some. Ignore what you were told by your college economics professor and consider the following puzzle. Whenever you hear a snotty European presenting his stereotypes about Americans, he will often describe them as \u201cunintellectual,\u201d \u201cuneducated,\u201d and \u201cpoor in math,\u201d because, unlike European schooling, American education is not based on equation drills and memorization. Yet the person making these statements will likely be addicted to his iPod, wearing a T-shirt and blue jeans, and using Microsoft Word to jot down his \u201ccultural\u201d statements on his Intel-based PC, with some Google searches on the Internet here and there interrupting his composition. If old enough, he might also be using Viagra. America\u2019s primary export, it appears, is trial-and-error, and the innovative knowledge attained in such a way. Trial-and-error has error in it; and most top-down traditional rational and academic environments do not like the fallibility of \u201cerror\u201d and the embarrassment of not quite knowing where they\u2019re going. The U.S. fosters entrepreneurs and creators, not exam-takers, bureaucrats or, worse, deluded economists. So the perceived weakness of the American pupil in conventional studies is where his or her very strength may lie. The American system of trial and error produces doers: Black Swan-hunting, dream-chasing entrepreneurs, with a tolerance for a certain class of risk-taking and for making plenty of small errors on the road to success or knowledge. This environment also attracts aggressive tinkering foreigners like this author. Globalization allowed the U.S. to specialize in the creative aspect of things, the risk-taking production of concepts and ideas\u2013that is, the scalable part of production, in which more income can be generated from the same fixed assets through innovation. By exporting jobs, the U.S. has outsourced the less scalable and more linear components of production, assigning them to the citizens of more mathematical and culturally rigid states, who are happy to be paid by the hour to work on other people\u2019s ideas. Let us go one step further. It is high time to recognize that we humans are far better at doing than understanding, and better at tinkering than inventing. But we don\u2019t know it. We truly live under the illusion of order believing that planning and forecasting are possible. We are scared of the random, yet we live from its fruits. We are so scared of the random that we create disciplines that try to make sense of the past\u2013but we ultimately fail to understand it, just as we fail to see the future. The current discourse in economics, for example, is antiquated. American undirected free-enterprise works because it aggressively allows us to capture the randomness of the environment\u2013the cheap Black Swans. This works not just because of competition, and even less because of material incentives. Neither the followers of Adam Smith nor those of Karl Marx seem to be conscious of the prevalence and effect of wild randomness. They are too bathed in enlightenment-style cause-and-effect and cannot accept that skills and payoffs may have nothing to do with one another. Nor can they swallow the argument that it is not necessarily the better technology that wins, but rather, the luckiest one. And, sadly, even those who accept this fundamental uncertainty often fail to see that it is a good thing. Random tinkering is the path to success. And fortunately, we are increasingly learning to practice it without knowing it\u2013thanks to overconfident entrepreneurs, naive investors, greedy investment bankers, confused scientists and aggressive venture capitalists brought together by the free-market system. We need more tinkering: Uninhibited, aggressive, proud tinkering. We need to make our own luck. We can be scared and worried about the future, or we can look at it as a collection of happy surprises that lie outside the path of our imagination.

        "article": "Does more liberty necessarily mean less security, and vice versa? The balance between security and civil liberties. Absolutely not, according to some of the readers who commented on my post on the security trade-offs of the post-9/11 decade for The Agenda, our continuing discussion of fundamental issues getting less than full debate in the presidential campaign. I talked about how the government\u2019s beefed-up counterterrorism measures have led to a calculated erosion of privacy and civil liberties. I asked whether the next president should consider a recalibration, since there has been nothing like a repeat of the Sept. 11 attacks, or whether the government\u2019s current surveillance programs and other intrusive measures should be maintained to protect the public. The balance between security and civil liberties. But Marc Rotenberg, the president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington, was among several readers who thought the question was posed incorrectly. \u201cGiving up civil liberties does not enhance security in a constitutional democracy,\u201d Mr. Rotenberg wrote. \u201cIt transforms the character of the society, making it less open, less resilient, and more prone to the illusions of security theater.\u201d Some readers cited variants of the classic Benjamin Franklin epigram: \u201cThey who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety.\u201d But who decides what liberty is \u201cessential\u201d? And is protection from terrorism just \u201ca little temporary safety,\u201d or something more crucial? Some who wrote responses argued that security from terrorism is an essential precondition for liberty. Francine from Massachusetts wrote that \u201cFreedom and liberty are assured by security.\u201d She added: \u201cI\u2019m not a huge fan of either the Patriot Act or Homeland Security. But the idea of coordinating information among various agencies and speeding up the process by which emergencies can be dealt with was an idea long overdue.\u201d Air travel, she wrote, \u201cis a privilege, not a right. I would rather not die in a terrorist attack, thank you very much.\u201d R.L.K. from Chappaqua, N.Y., doesn\u2019t get those who complain about security measures: \u201cOther than some small delay getting on planes, I hardly notice much difference between the way I ran my life pre-9/11 and now.\u201d In fact, R.L.K. added, \u201cI am grateful for the added security. There really has been very little or no diminishing of my rights or my freedom. And I am thankful, rather than resentful, for that.\u201d Jon from New York City, was still more blunt: \u201cStare a real terrorist in the eyes in combat, and then tell me we don\u2019t need these measures.\u201d But other readers are more skeptical about the government\u2019s huge security build-up since the 2001 attacks. Those who attribute the absence of major terrorist attacks in the years since to government actions \u201cconfuse correlation with causation,\u201d wrote Bradley Bleck from Spokane, Wash. \u201cWe have given up liberty for the illusion of security.\u201d Pribilof of Denver agreed: \u201cI think we have gone too far in giving up liberty for \u2018security,\u2019\u201d Pribilof wrote. \u201cDo you really want the government wiretapping and gathering your G.P.S. data without a warrant or judicial review? Do we really want habeas corpus suspended, even for terrorism suspects? What a terrible precedent to set.\u201d Cameron Bedard, of Providence, R.I., connected the government\u2019s increased surveillance measures and those of private companies, whose databases the government often acquires. \u201cSuppose you are a law abiding citizen and you have \u2018nothing to hide\u2019. You are comfortable with the increasing number of surveillance cameras lining your streets, the expanding powers given to law enforcement officials to monitor your emails and electronic communications without warrant and you do not have an issue when subjected to more rigorous security checks at rail stations, airports or on public transportation.\u201d But Cameron asks: \u201cHow would you feel if an affair were disclosed to your significant other after a private investigator requested your driving record from Microdesign\u2019s Electronic Toll Collection database? That is the company that aggregates data on automobiles passing through toll booths across the country. They also sell that information for profit, not only to the state but to restaurateurs. The point is, we all have something to hide.\u201d Scott H., from New York, concluded that the government was unlikely to give up any of the powers it has obtained over the last decade: \u201cAssuming the next president is Obama or Romney, I see no evidence of either one of them heading toward conclusion B\u201d \u2013 that is, downsizing the security measures. Another reader using the screen name Angry Panda echoed that view: \u201cPower, once gained, is not easily surrendered, whether by the White House (extrajudicial killings, etc.), the Pentagon (enemy combatant rules), or the national security complex (warrantless wiretaps, etc.).\u201d Today, this reader wrote, \u201cThere are huge economic and political interests in play here, not to mention a very convenient expansion of the security state as far as the elite are concerned. Why would this change now?\u201d In the next few weeks, we will try to move from this animated but general debate to some more focused posts on striking developments in security, surveillance, the technology that drives them and the laws that enable them.",

        "article": "No, you can\u2019t. Mr. McBurney and his ace sound designers, Gareth Fry and Pete Malkin, have created an aural labyrinth of many layers. You\u2019ll be watching Mr. McBurney\u2019s lips moving in sync with what you\u2019re hearing, only to discover that it\u2019s just a recorded voice you\u2019ve been listening to. Did I say \u201cjust a recorded voice\u201d? It\u2019s a mistake to give undue value to what\u2019s \u201creal\u201d over what\u2019s a simulacrum of reality. With your earphones on, there\u2019s no distinguishing between the live and the prerecorded, a blurring that allows Mr. McBurney to conduct very immediate-feeling conversations with his past selves. And with his 5-year-old daughter, whose voice keeps interrupting him in what feels like real time. And with a host of people he interviewed in preparation for this show, including Mr. Popescu and a variety of neuroscientists, philosophers and environmentalists, who keep interrupting the central story with fragments of theories you\u2019ve heard them expound earlier in the show. The subject of what they have to say is profound enough to feel embarrassing. Among the questions posed: Is consciousness possible without memory? Is time only a structuring fiction devised by humans? Does time have one or two dimensions? Can language exist without words? Does the introduction of modern materialist cultures into indigenous communities inevitably destroy their essence? Don\u2019t worry if you didn\u2019t sign up for a lecture. The academics are never allowed to hold forth for long. Instead, their voices poke into our consciousness in shards, like flotsam and jetsam carried by a rushing stream. This melding of partly articulated ideas suggests that twilight that occurs just before you fall asleep, when the accumulated impressions of a day \u2014 and a lifetime \u2014 swirl in and out of focus, each weighted with the same significance. And there are moments that approximate the jolting, abrupt waking from such a state of mind. You can be river-deep and mountain-high in the forest with a bewildered and depleted McIntyre after he\u2019s been stripped of all his modern-man appurtenances, when the sound of a door opening thrusts us into Mr. McBurney\u2019s London home, in the room where he is working on this show and where his restless little girl has entered yet again with a bedtime request. So are these domestic scenes the present tense of the show? No, that would be the show itself, right? Better not to think too hard about this while you\u2019re watching it. Not that your mind (or whatever you choose to call it) is ever likely to drift. Mr. McBurney, who does McIntyre\u2019s voice as that of a strapping stoic from a cowboy film, sustains the momentum of his story as tensely and enjoyably as if it were a Rudyard Kipling yarn, albeit of a postcolonial ilk. This isn\u2019t a voyage into a heart of darkness but of enlightenment. And yes, there\u2019s an attendant glimmer of New Age spiritualism. But the awe-struck descriptions of nature in ascendance are always secondary to what we\u2019re feeling, physically as well as emotionally. And \u201cThe Encounter,\u201d which has only sharpened its production values since I saw it in London in February, summons those sensations not just through sound but also through lighting (by Paul Anderson) and projections (by Will Duke) that transform a sterile stage into a phosphorescent jungle where shadow trumps substance or an American suburb illuminated by a bonfire of discarded worldly goods. For \u201cThe Encounter\u201d is definitely a work of theater. And though you first meet Mr. McBurney as a vaguely detached magician M.C., his performance becomes increasingly passionate and physical. He is wrestling with all the elements that go into telling and listening to a story, which includes those transporting moments when the teller becomes the tale. As does the audience. Just before you put on your earphones, Mr. McBurney says, by way of partial explanation, that \u201cempathy and proximity are connected.\u201d It may be he who\u2019s running and dancing and leaping and sweating. But by the end of this nonpareil show\u2019s two intermissionless hours, you are as lightheaded, exhausted, baffled and invigorated as if it had been you.

        "article": "When you need something short and funny to read, it helps to have a few old journalistic favorites on standby. Mine include Dave Barry\u2019s seminal Miami Herald piece \u201cCan New York Save Itself?\u201d and a Guardian article from 2002 in which the writer, Tim Dowling, was forced by his editors to spend a night in a trench in his backyard. Last year I relaxed the rules and added a contemporary entry to my greatest hits list. Called \u201cPets Allowed,\u201d it featured Patricia Marx, a New Yorker staff writer, running around town with a variety of creatures \u2014 snake, alpaca, pig, turtle, turkey \u2014 that she claimed were emotional-service pets necessary to alleviate her anxiety and distress. (She had a doctor\u2019s note.) \u201cNo animals were harmed during the writing of this article,\u201d she wrote, \u201cbut one journalist did have to get down on her hands and knees to clean her carpet.\u201d Having read that sentence, or another one describing Ms. Marx\u2019s TriBeCa outing with the fake-emotional-service snake \u2014 \u201cAs I walked down Wooster Street, Augustus tickled my ear and then started to slither down my blouse. (Men!)\u201d \u2014 who would not want to read her new book, \u201cLet\u2019s Be Less Stupid\u201d? In this slim, bright-pink volume, Ms. Marx sets out to uncover why her brain does not appear to be working as speedily as it used to. The problem is acute: \u201cIndeed, sometimes, when I look for my glasses while wearing my glasses, I think, \u2018My, my, it\u2019s going to be a very smooth transition to dementia,\u2019 \u201d she writes. Much the way the movie \u201cInside Out\u201d does with its 11-year-old protagonist, Ms. Marx takes us on a guided tour of the inner workings of her head. She draws a number of Roz Chast-like diagrams, including one called \u201cInside Patty\u2019s Confusion\u201d that shows it to be clogged with items like: \u201cIan McKellen or Ian McEwan?\u201d and \u201cHow to set alarm on clock radio?\u201d and \u201cWhere\u2019s that thing for the thing?\u201d Having submitted to an M.R.I. of her brain (\u201cIs this what it feels like to be a piece of paper about to be photocopied?\u201d she asks, slithering into the tube), Ms. Marx embarks on a regimen to boost her flagging faculties. \u201cI\u2019m no mind reader (yet),\u201d she notes, \u201cbut I bet you are thinking, it took her many years to become as stupid as she is, how can she expect to become much less stupid in four months?\u201d She tries to learn Cherokee on the Internet. She does mental exercises from the website Lumosity. She and her boyfriend spend time wearing a device that shoots pulses of electricity into their brains, for stimulation purposes. \u201cDo any of these programs work?\u201d she asks. \u201cDefine work.\u201d This is investigative journalism at its laziest. I mean that in a positive way. \u201cYou don\u2019t really expect me to eat legumes and unrefined cereal, do you?\u201d Ms. Marx says. Nor will she try to sleep more, or apply herself very rigorously to \u201cmindful meditation,\u201d especially when her instructor declares, \u201cIf you understand the raisin, you understand mindfulness.\u201d (\u201cThat\u2019s a big if,\u201d Ms. Marx says.) The author does, however, provide a quiz \u2014 there are a lot of quizzes in this book, mostly designed to show you how quickly your brain is collapsing in on itself \u2014 in which you\u2019re meant to identify which examples from a list of Indian words are meditation mantras, and which are types of bread. It is harder than you might think. (Sheermal: bread. Shring: mantra.) I read \u201cLet\u2019s Be Less Stupid\u201d over a few days \u2014 you can dip in and out, the way you might take an occasional swig of whiskey (or whatever works) as a pick-me-up \u2014 and kept forgetting where I\u2019d put it down. It seemed like a case of form reflecting content. Ms. Marx\u2019s writing style seemed to be infecting mine, too, at least in a wan, subpar sort of way. Oddly, that does not happen when I read, say, works by Faulkner. This book will not take you a very long time to finish, unless your brain is so tired that it needs a rest between chapters. Or unless you are \u201cso startled by what I have to say your heart will say whoa,\u201d Ms. Marx writes, \u201cand you will keel over for good.\u201d (Not likely.) In any case, you may want to supplement it with earlier works from the Marx oeuvre. She\u2019s the author of two novels that concern themselves, roughly, with the vexing issue of romance. Much like her nonfiction, they are unusual. It might help to have that bottle of whiskey handy when you read the second one, \u201cStarting From Happy,\u201d so you can suspend disbelief. (Suspend belief? I always forget.) Then there are Ms. Marx\u2019s wonderful articles in The New Yorker, including the sublime account of her efforts to understand why South Korea is the world capital of plastic surgery. (\u201cIf you want to feel bad about your looks, spend some time in Seoul.\u201d) Humor is a delicate, personal thing. Either an author\u2019s sensibility appeals to you, or it doesn\u2019t. Some people undoubtedly find Faulkner funny, or those Geico car-insurance ads. Ms. Marx might not be everyone\u2019s cup of tea. But she is mine. \u201cLet\u2019s Be Less Stupid\u201d is not \u201cBeing and Nothingness\u201d or even \u201cFree to Be You and Me,\u201d but as Ms. Marx would say, who\u2019s keeping track? With the direction your brain is heading, it\u2019s not as if you\u2019ll remember what happened in those books, anyway. An Attempt to Maintain My Mental Faculties Illustrated. 188 pages.

        "article": "A grand Neoclassic estate with a rich pedigree and a colorful past - - but in need of some TLC -- is on the market in Piedmont. The Willis Polk-designed house and gardens at 86 Sea View Ave. was built for $30,000 in 1912, roughly $600,000 in today's dollars. Asking price is $8. 185 million, a record listing price for Piedmont, although another property listed at $7.6 million sold for $8.8 million last year. The house, built in 1912, has had just three owners in its nearly 100 years. It was occupied from 1912 until 1955 by James Kennedy Moffitt and Pauline Fore Moffitt. Moffitt, scion of a prominent San Francisco family, was owner and president of the Bear Gulch Water Co. and served on the executive committee of Crocker First National Bank of San Francisco. He was a UC Berkeley regent for most of the first half of the 20th century but is perhaps best remembered for his mountain climbing exploits. Moffitt climbed before the advent of now-standard equipment such as carabiners and pitons and made it into the history books with some of the first recorded ascents of the principal peaks of the Sierra. The gift of his classic book collection to UC Berkeley was acknowledged by bestowing his name on the Moffitt Library. Moffitt selected the east side of the street to site the house because, at the time, it had a view of the water. Built long and narrow, like a railroad car, the house is oriented on a north/south axis so that the rooms had bay views from the front, and overlooked acres of poppy fields in the rear. There were so few homes in Piedmont in 1912 that new taxpayers picked their address. Moffitt selected 86, because he was a Cal grad, class of 1886. The exterior gives little hint of the grandeur inside, but it does display some of Polk's signature touches: a Tuscan portico, a hand-carved Baroque cartouche above the entry and a tiled hipped roof. Inside, a long Italian renaissance entry divides the house into north and south wings. With arched, high ceilings, matching pendant chandeliers supported by symmetrical decorative colonnades and ornately carved porticos at each end, the entry hall looks through the house to the formal gardens behind. In the south wing is a salon-style living room, with an intricate coved ceiling, multilayer crown molding, floor-to-ceiling windows, stone fireplace and a card room alcove. The library features a carved fireplace, mahogany paneling and custom- built wraparound cabinetry. Pauline Watts, Moffitt's great-granddaughter, remembers him filling the library shelves with the classics and teaching himself Latin so he could read Horace in the original. When the house was designed, French doors led to a solarium that opened to a reflecting pool and the wooded hills beyond. Moffitt, an avid gardener, tended the grounds with the help of three full-time staff. In those days, garden tours were all the rage and 86 Sea View was on the circuit. Disguised by a large sun hat, Moffitt would say when asked whether he was well compensated for his labors, \"No, but I am given room and board.\" Today, although the reflecting pool is gone and nearly half the acreage has been sold, it remains one of the finest private gardens in the Bay Area. The grounds include a swimming pool, terraced patios, manicured lawns, marble benches, cherubic statues, boxwood hedges, a fountain, a sundial, and flower gardens galore. Polk was highly regarded for his elegant designs of mansions in the Georgian Revival style for wealthy San Franciscans. In 1915, William Bowers Bourn II commissioned him for the 654-acre Filoli estate in Woodside, which was donated to the National Trust for Historic Preservation in 1975. Polk also designed the Carolands estate in Hillsborough, which at one time was the largest residence west of the Mississippi. In 1917-18, Polk designed the Hallidie Building, the first high-rise structure with a glass curtain-wall construction. It would serve as the architect's most important civic effort and his last major project of note. He died in 1924 at the age of 57. In 1956, the property was sold to the Stanley Dollar family. Dollar was president of the Robert Dollar Co., Dollar Steamship Line and Globe Wireless Ltd. In 1970, the Dollars sold it to former Bank of America President Rudolph Arvid Peterson and his wife, Barbara, who lived there until they died, he in 2003, she in 2004. The last owner, Rudy Peterson, was another Cal alum. An immigrant Swedish farm boy, he became president of Bank of America, overseeing its growth from 16 international branches to nearly 100 and almost doubling the firm's operations. After retiring in 1970, he served as chairman of several presidential commissions and headed the U.N. Development Program for three years. The Petersons subdivided the property in 1986, selling a 1.2-acre parcel at the rear of the property. The house's 8,328 square feet of living space includes five bedrooms, five baths and two half-baths. The lot is nearly 1.5 acres. The interior of the house has been somewhat neglected by current standards and the finishes and fixtures show their age. Even the listing agent, Angela Wei Grubb, acknowledges this, but is quick to point out, \"with a garden like this, it's the opportunity of a lifetime. I'm sure preservationists hope the new owners merely restore it to its original grandeur.\"",

If there is another explanation for why he thinks he was brought here to Earth to save the game of baseball, or for why he cannot understand when former athletes are not happy with his decision to keep writing tell-all books, I would absolutely love to hear it. And actually, I thought I might hear some of it when I listened to , in which Boomer Esiason and Craig Carton take a less than \"cautious\" approach to asking Jose questions about his new book, Instead, Jose just abruptly got mad (sign!) when they queried about showing off his wife's breasts to Debbie and and hung up the phone. Much to the delight of Boomer and Carton, actually. It's a really funny interview, in fact, with such great hits as: \"Your opinion doesn't count\" (Jose to Boomer), \"tell the truth\" (what Jose's mission is) and \"attack major league baseball back\" (since they banned him from the game that he so clearly loves), \"hypocrite, liar, politically correct\" (all about Alex Rodriguez), and a slew of others. Clearly the best though is Carton's decision to ask Jose about his financial situation, to which Jose's emotions immediately swing towards defensive (sign!) and he refuses to discuss how much money he has, instead focusing on his heartfelt need to tell the truth about baseball and restore the purity of the game. At this point I could go off on some tangent about the dual personality nature (sign!) of Jose's \"love affair\" with baseball. Or I could do what Boomer and Carton did and laugh about him hanging up at the mention of \"ta-ta's\". Or I could just sigh and enjoy the fact that a new season of baseball is here, and whether Jose Canseco cares or not, we're all going to enjoy it. And really, the only way to take him any more seriously at this point would be if he made an appearance on a C-list ex-celebrity reality television show.

St. Francis Wood Tudor hosts superlative finishes in a timeless setting Plenty of pedestrians on Miraloma Drive in St. Francis Wood have no idea what they just passed. Despite standing three stories tall and offering more than 6,700 square feet of living space, an eight-bedroom mansion goes virtually unnoticed at times because of its placement below street level. But those who enter the estate created by architect Henry H. Gutterson in 1928 rave about the craftsmanship, versatility and superlative views. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what to say other than the house is so magnificent. It has grand scale and views from almost every room,\u201d said Jane Poppelreiter of Paragon Real Estate Group, who is listing the Tudor for $4.25 million. \u201cEverybody who comes in is astonished at the craftsmanship.\u201d A Japanese white oak staircase spanning all three levels perhaps best epitomizes the home\u2019s sumptuous details. Each piece of the quarter-sawn hardwood was fashioned by hand and is one of dozens of original design elements. \u201cThe home has only had two owners,\u201d Poppelreiter said. \u201cThe home is largely unchanged since 1928.\u201d Leaded glass windows dominate the residence and frame views of Harding Park, Lake Merced, the Olympic Club and the Pacific Ocean. The Farallon Islands are visible on clear days. The horizontal design enables residents to spend several hours at a time on each level. Public rooms dominate the ground floor while bedrooms \u2014 including a master suite with one of the home\u2019s five fireplaces \u2014 occupy the second. The top floor includes a variety of bonus rooms. \u201cThe home technically has eight bedrooms, but the spaces are versatile,\u201d Poppelreiter said. Formal gardens flank the residence, which sits on a lot that\u2019s considerably larger than most in St. Francis Wood. Manicured hedges line the landscaped backyard and mature trees provide shade. Homes imagined by Gutterson are scattered throughout St. Francis Wood. Gutterson\u2019s production was prolific, especially when he acted as supervising architect of the bucolic community during its first four decades. This particular Tudor includes the combination of romantic, classical and practical designs found in Gutterson\u2019s portfolio.

        "article": "Afghan army soldiers participate in a military training programme in Kabul, Afghanistan. Photograph: Xinhua/Landov/Barcroft Media An Afghan man wearing an Afghan army uniform shot at US soldiers in south-eastern Afghanistan, killing at least one serviceman on Sunday, local officials and the Nato-led coalition said. The so-called \"insider attack\" in Paktika province is the fourth in less than a month and is likely to strain already tense ties between coalition troops and their allies, with most foreign troops scheduled to withdraw by the end of next year. A Reuters tally shows Sunday's incident was the tenth this year, and took the death toll of foreign personnel to 15. \"A man wearing an Afghan army uniform shot at Americans in Sharana city [the provincial capital] near the governor's office,\" said an Afghan official, adding that two soldiers had been hit by the gunfire. The Nato-led coalition confirmed one soldier had been shot by a man in security forces uniform, but did not comment on his nationality or whether the Afghan was wearing a army uniform. Insider attacks threaten to further undermine waning support for the war among Western nations sending troops to Afghanistan. A similar flurry of attacks last year prompted the Nato-led force to briefly suspend all joint activities and take steps to curb interaction between foreign and Afghan troops. That has cut down the number of incidents, but some soldiers say the measures have further eroded the hard-won trust painstakingly nurtured between the allies over more than 12 years of war. Late on Saturday, the US Secretary of State, John Kerry, and President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan announced they had reached preliminary agreement on a bilateral security pact that now depends on the approval of Afghanistan's tribal leaders. The pact, announced jointly by Kerry and Karzai late on Saturday after two days of talks in the capital, Kabul, would keep some US forces in Afghanistan after the withdrawal of most foreign troops by the end of next year. The draft includes a US demand to retain legal jurisdiction over its troops who stay on in Afghanistan, which would give them immunity from Afghan law. Karzai opposes that and said the question could not be decided by his government. Instead, a Loya Jirga, or an assembly of elders, leaders and other influential people, will consider the demand and decide whether to accept it. The United States is insisting it cannot agree to a deal unless it is granted the right to try in the United States its citizens who break the law in Afghanistan. \"We need to say that if the issue of jurisdiction cannot be resolved, then unfortunately there cannot be a bilateral security agreement,\" Kerry told a news conference. Karzai said the recent US snatching of a senior Pakistani Taliban commander on Afghan soil was an example of the kind of action that Afghanistan wanted to avoid. \"Our discussion today in particular has been focused on making sure that through the bilateral security agreement such violations are not repeated,\" he said.",

        "article": "I got into the first serious car accident of my life yesterday and it happened to take place in Baghdad, a few days after I returned from a break. It was strange to have an accident in a place where the norms that dictate how those situations are handled, like what kind of car insurance you have or whether any traffic laws were broken, don\u2019t really exist. My driver was taking me to a press conference in the afternoon, and we had stopped to make a turn to go through a checkpoint. All of a sudden, we heard the crush of metal. My sunglasses flew off my face, my forehead hit the dashboard and then the back of my head hit the seat. I was dazed and it took me a few seconds to realize what had happened. But then I got out of the car and the process of arguing with the driver, figuring out who was at fault, and calling the police began. The accident took place in the International Zone (otherwise known as the Green Zone) so the IZ police showed up and took statements from us. They are American soldiers and wear military uniforms. Fortunately, my driver and I had a bit of a concussion but we were otherwise OK. The other driver and passenger were in an SUV and were fine. My driver\u2019s sedan, however, was badly damaged and the trunk was bent open. Car insurance doesn\u2019t really exist in Iraq so there was a question of who would pay for the repair costs. And courts don\u2019t function properly here, so suing someone isn\u2019t an option. I asked an Iraqi friend how a car accident between two Iraqis in a normal Baghdad neighborhood would be resolved. He laughed and said, \u201cThe two would beat each other and whoever wins gets compensation.\u201d He meant that figuratively, meaning whoever fought and pushed for it the hardest would be the winner. He said he got into a bad car accident once and the other person was clearly at fault. The traffic police came and took statements. The other driver was supposed to meet my friend the next day to pay for car repairs but he didn\u2019t show up. When my friend went to the traffic police to ask for an official accident report to force the other guy to pay, he was asked for a bribe. He told the police officer that he, his wife and his mother-in-law had all been injured in the accident and his car was wrecked, and asked why the officer was still asking for a bribe. \u201cWell, I can\u2019t help you if you can\u2019t pay,\u201d the officer said. Even though several of my friend\u2019s mother in law\u2019s teeth were broken as a result of the accident, he didn\u2019t pay the bribe. It wasn\u2019t worth the trouble to him. So he paid the car repair costs and hospital bills himself. In the case of my accident, I deemed the accident to be the other driver\u2019s fault since she was on her cellphone and wasn\u2019t paying attention when she slammed into us at a speed of about 35 miles per hour. Her security personnel, who arrived after the accident occurred, blamed us and said we weren\u2019t allowed to turn there. But there are no signs saying turns aren\u2019t allowed at that particular area, and many people turn there to go through a checkpoint. Besides, no one really obeys the traffic rules that do exist. There are yellow and white lines painted on some roads, but many times people drive in between lanes. To make a left turn, Iraqis often drive into the oncoming traffic lane and then merge over to the other side when it\u2019s safe to do so. Luckily the person who was driving the car that hit us is an Iraqi-American woman who works for an American company, which is employed by the U.S. Department of Defense. I happened to know her boss, so hopefully that should make it easier to sort out payment in our case.",

After losing her job as a health coordinator who taught courses on how to eat healthfully, Hollis-Neely, 47, became depressed, and added to her already-growing weight. Now severely obese, she made a dangerous move from her home in Detroit, Michigan to stay in a hospital under the Dr. Younan Nowzaradan in Houston, Texas, in the hopes of saving her life. But before any surgery can happen, Nowzaradan has to be able to weigh Hollis-Neely, a wife and mother, and get her to stand on a scale. \"Over the last couple of weeks we've been able to get Teretha's weight going back down in the right direction,\" Nowzaradan says in an exclusive clip from Wednesday's episode of . \"So we're going to try to get her to stand up to check her weight and measure loose skin. But it's going to take a lot to do this.\" \"We need five to six people to hold her up so she doesn't fall and end up on the floor,\" he continues. \"If she does, we won't be able to get her up, and the stress could cause very serious complications to her condition. But this is something she needs to do if she wants her health to improve.\" \"I don't think I'm ready to do this,\" says Hollis-Neely.

I'm down. Just let me go down, please. I just can't get back up,\" she says. \"Teretha refused to put her weight on her legs,\" says Nowzaradan. \"The problem is, it hurt, so she thinks that means she shouldn't do it. Her problem is in her head, she doesn't want to try, and I'm very concerned about her now. She's not making progress on her own so we have to do it for her. That has to change, because her body is not going to last much longer being immobile.\" After a month in the hospital, Teretha managed to make it , but her attitude is still holding her back. \"She started finding ways to get extra servings from the kitchen,\" says Nowzaradan. \"Now that she's cheating and refusing to walk, there's no reason to keep her in the hospital. She's scared to live a life of eating what she wants and staying in bed all day.\" Now Nowzaradan is hoping that cracking the mental code that's stopping Teretha from fully \"I'm sending her home, and I'm going to send a therapist to her house to ask why she's unwilling to try.\" airs Wednesday nights at 9/8c on TLC.",

        "article": "A strike by school bus drivers is inevitable, the city\u2019s top education official said Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of if it will happen, but when it will happen,\u201d Chancellor Dennis Walcott said. A strike \u2014 which could be announced Monday and begin Wednesday \u2014 would cripple school bus service for 152,000 kids, including 54,000 with disabilities. The drivers union is threatening a walkout over a city effort to seek new operators for more than 1,000 routes \u2014 the ones covering special-education students. The drivers want a provision that would guarantee their jobs even after new operators are chosen, but the city says that\u2019s illegal under a ruling by the state\u2019s highest court. Besides, city officials don\u2019t want such a provision because it would make it more difficult to cut costs. \u201cThey are using our students as pawns to have us do something that is illegal. This is totally irresponsible,\u201d Walcott said. \u201cThis is a strike against our children.\u201d A spokeswoman for the union, Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1811, declined to comment. Lawyers for the school bus companies warned Sunday that if the strike goes ahead, they\u2019ll ask federal labor authorities for an injunction to stop it. They say that since the union\u2019s beef is with the city, not with them, a strike against the companies is illegal. They\u2019d also sue, \u201cseeking all available damages, which will be many millions of dollars and would likely deplete the union coffers,\u201d lawyer Jeffrey Pollack wrote in a letter to the union. Past National Labor Relations Board rulings have found that such a strike would be legal, the union maintains. The union threatened to strike last year over a similar dispute, but ended up returning to the negotiating table. But this time, the union has begun to distribute flyers and leaflets, indicating a strike is likely. Parents of kids who use school buses \u2014 preschoolers, special-ed students and grade-schoolers who live beyond walking distance from their school \u2014 were scrambling to figure out how to handle a service shutdown. \u201cI am going to have to get up an hour earlier and walk him to school. I wake up at 5 already. But I am his parent, and I am going to do what I\u2019ve got to do,\u201d said Michelle Hayes of Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, mom of a fourth-grader. \u201cThe city needs to step up its game and give the bus drivers what they deserve,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think they should let these people go on strike,\u201d said Kizzy Henry, 33, whose 5- and 3-year-old niece and nephew use school buses. \u201cSo many kids won\u2019t be able to get to school.\u201d Walcott said the city was ready with MetroCards and plans to reimburse parents for getting their kids to school by car or taxi \u2014 but acknowledged there would be some chaos and not all kids would make it to class. \u201cI want to be very frank that the first day or so will not be easy,\u201d he said, adding the city was gearing for a potentially lengthy strike. \u201cWe\u2019re prepared to get our children to school. We are prepared to withstand a long-term strike. Hopefully this will not get to that.\u201d Workers were on pins and needles awaiting word. One Brooklyn bus driver said she opposes a strike. \u201cWe are extremely nervous. We don\u2019t want to strike. How are we going to feed our families? We don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. They told us that they will talk to us Monday and tell us what to do,\u201d said the 48-year-old mom of two. \u201cI hope everything goes back to normal.\u201d BE READY If bus drivers go on strike, here\u2019s what you need to know: Information will be available on whether your child\u2019s bus route is running at schools.nyc.gov or by calling 311. All children who usually get yellow bus service can get a free MetroCard at their school. Parents of kids in kindergarten through second grade and special-education students of all ages can also get a MetroCard to get them to school. In areas where public transportation isn\u2019t available, parents can get reimbursed for driving their kids to school at 55 cents per mile. They can also get reimbursed for a taxi or car service with a receipt. The city has told cab companies to prepare for extra demand and have as many cars as possible on the street. For students who can\u2019t make it to school, the city plans to post materials online for every grade and core subject they can study at home. Students who are late because of the school bus strike will be excused for up to two hours. Kids who don\u2019t make it to school will be marked absent with a special explanation code so they won\u2019t be penalized. Field trips that use yellow buses will be canceled. After-school programs will remain open but there will be no bus service. Erin Durkin",

        "article": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal health officials on Thursday approved an innovative new option for Americans struggling with addiction to heroin and painkillers: a drug-oozing implant that curbs craving and withdrawal symptoms for six months at a time. The first-of-a-kind device, Probuphine, arrives as communities across the U.S. grapple with a wave of addiction tied to opioids, highly-addictive drugs that include legal pain medications like OxyContin and illegal narcotics like heroin. The implant from Braeburn Pharmaceuticals is essentially a new delivery system for an established drug, buprenorphine, which has long been used to treat opioid addiction. But its implantable format could help patients avoid relapses that can occur if they miss a medication dose. Roughly 2.5 million Americans suffer from addiction disorders related to prescription painkillers and heroin, according to federal estimates. The matchstick-size implant slowly releases a low dose of buprenorphine over six months. Previously the drug was only available as a pill or film that dissolves under the tongue. It is considered a safer, more palatable alternative to methadone, the decades-old standard for controlling opioid addiction. Probuphine is intended for patients who have already been stabilized on low-to-medium doses of buprenorphine for at least six months. Braeburn estimates that one fourth, or 325,000, of the 1.3 million patients currently taking buprenorphine meet that criterion. The FDA previously rejected Probuphine in April 2012, judging the drug's dose was too low to reliably help the broad range of opioid-addicted patients. Braeburn and partner Titan Pharmaceuticals resubmitted the product with additional data and it received a positive endorsement from federal advisers earlier this year. The FDA said Thursday that Probuphine should be used as part of a multipronged addiction treatment program that includes counseling and other forms of support. Doctors who implant the device must also receive special training to safely insert and remove the device. FDA officials are spotlighting new treatment options for opioid abuse, after weathering heavy criticism for not acting faster to combat the epidemic of addiction and overdose tied to the drugs. \"We must do everything we can to make new, innovative treatment options available that can help patients regain control over their lives,\" said Dr. Robert Califf, who became FDA commissioner in February. Heroin and opioid painkillers caused 28,650 fatal overdoses in 2014, the highest number on record in the U.S. Despite those numbers, experts say buprenorphine remains underused due to federal limits on how many prescriptions each doctors can write, gaps in insurance and a lack of acceptance by doctors. Along with increasing compliance, Probuphine has the potential to address other problems associated with the oral buprenorphine, including illegal diversion and accidental poisoning in children. Braeburn's CEO Behshad Sheldon says 2,200 doctors have already signed up to take the training course required to administer Probuphine. The company could train as many as 4,000 physicians by the end of the year, she says.",

        "article": "His secretary of defense says \u201cthe world is exploding all over.\u201d His attorney general says that the threat of terror \u201ckeeps me up at night.\u201d The world bears them out. On Tuesday, American hostage Kayla Mueller is confirmed dead. On Wednesday, the U.S. evacuates its embassy in Yemen, cited by President Obama last September as an American success in fighting terrorism. Yet Obama\u2019s reaction to, shall we say, turmoil abroad has been one of alarming lassitude and passivity. Not to worry, says his national security adviser: This is not WWII. As if one should be reassured because the current chaos has yet to achieve the level of the most devastating conflict in human history. Indeed, insists the President, the real source of our metastasizing anxiety is . . . the news media. Russia pushes deep into eastern Ukraine. The Islamic State burns to death a Jordanian pilot. Iran extends its hegemony over four Arab capitals \u2014 Beirut, Damascus, Baghdad and now Sanaa. And America watches. Obama calls the policy \u201cstrategic patience.\u201d That\u2019s a synonym for \u201cinaction,\u201d made to sound profoundly \u201cstrategic.\u201d Take Russia. The only news out of Obama\u2019s one-hour press conference with Angela Merkel this week was that he still can\u2019t make up his mind whether to supply Ukraine with defensive weapons. The Russians have sent in T-80 tanks and Grad rocket launchers. We\u2019ve sent in humanitarian aid that includes blankets, MREs and psychological counselors. How complementary: The counselors do grief therapy for those on the receiving end of the T-80 tank fire. \u201cI think the Ukrainian people can feel confident that we have stood by them,\u201d said Obama at the news conference. Indeed. And don\u2019t forget the blankets. America was once the arsenal of democracy, notes Elliott Abrams. We are now its linen closet. Why no anti-tank and other defensive weapons? Because we are afraid that arming the victim of aggression will anger the aggressor. Such on-the-ground appeasement goes well with the linguistic appeasement whereby Obama dares not call radical Islam by name. And whereby both the White House and State Department spend much of a day insisting that the attack on the kosher grocery in Paris had nothing to do with Jews. It was just, as the President said, someone \u201crandomly shoot(ing) a bunch of folks in a deli.\u201d (By the end of the day, the administration backed off this idiocy. By tweet.) This passivity \u2014 strategic, syntactical, ideological \u2014 is more than just a reaction to the perceived overreach of the Bush years. Or a fear of failure. Or bowing to the domestic left. It is, above all, rooted in Obama\u2019s deep belief that we \u2014 America, Christians, the West \u2014 lack the moral authority to engage, to project, i.e., to lead. Before we condemn the atrocities of others, intoned Obama at the National Prayer Breakfast, we shouldn\u2019t \u201cget on our high horse.\u201d We should acknowledge having authored the Crusades, the Inquisition, slavery, etc. \u201cin the name of Christ.\u201d In a rare rhetorical feat, Obama managed to combine the banal and the repulsive. After all, is it really a revelation that all religions have transgressed, that man is fallen? To the adolescent Columbia undergrad, that\u2019s a profundity. To a roomful of faith leaders, that\u2019s an insult to one\u2019s intelligence. And in deeply bad taste. A coalition POW is burned alive and the reaction of the alliance leader barely 48 hours later is essentially: \u201cHey, but what about Joan of Arc?\u201d Obama\u2019s Christians-have-sinned dismissal of the West\u2019s moral standing is not new, however. It is just a reprise of the theme of his post-inauguration 2009 confessional world tour. From Strasbourg to Cairo and the U.N. General Assembly, he indicted his own country, as I chronicled at the time, \u201cfor arrogance, for dismissiveness and derisiveness (toward Europe), for maltreatment of natives, for torture, for Hiroshima, for Guant\u00e1namo, for unilateralism, and for insufficient respect for the Muslim world.\u201d The purpose and the effect of such an indictment is to undermine any moral claim to American world leadership. The line between the Washington prayer breakfast and the Ukrainian grief counselors is direct and causal. Once you\u2019ve discounted your own moral authority, once you\u2019ve undermined your own country\u2019s moral self-confidence, you cannot lead. If, during the very week Islamic supremacists achieve \u201cpeak barbarism\u201d with the immolation of a helpless prisoner, you cannot take them on without apologizing for sins committed a thousand years ago, you have prepared the ground for strategic paralysis. All that\u2019s left is to call it strategic patience.",

His restaurants, notably Ocean Grill, Park Avalon and Isabella's, feed somewhere between 150 and 250 people at a sitting. Blue Water Grill, Blue Fin and Ruby Foo's Dim Sum and Sushi Palace on the Upper West Side can accommodate 400. That's a lot of food, and a lot of diners. B. R. Guest is the closest thing New York has to a major Hollywood studio turning out big-budget popular films with modest artistic goals. Somewhere along the way, Mr. Hanson got the itch to produce an art-house success, the kind of restaurant that would show that he could do class as well as mass, that he could please the discerning few as well as the clamorous many. And so the curtain rises on Fiamma Osteria, Mr. Hanson's ''Cinema Paradiso.'' It's a completely unnecessary venture, a wild deviation from a very successful game plan, but Mr. Hanson pulls it off. Fiamma Osteria is a beautifully realized restaurant, highly satisfying in every way. Mr. Hanson's venture into high-prestige territory is a SoHo town house with dining rooms on two levels. Upstairs, the designer Jeffrey Beers has created a subdued atmosphere with rich, saturated reds and browns. The walls, lacquered and lustrous, give off a muted shine, and there are funny touches here and there, like the crocodile-pattern leather padding that makes the bar up front look a little like a giant handbag. The downstairs room is lighter, brighter and louder, more brasserie than restaurant. All told, Fiamma, which is Italian for ''flame,'' handles a paltry 125 diners, hardly more than a private dinner party by Mr. Hanson's standards. The food lives up to the setting. Michael White, formerly the chef de cuisine at Spiaggia in Chicago and at Ristorante San Domenico near Bologna, plays variations on traditional Italian food in the only way that makes sense. He stays firmly rooted in the core principles of Italian cooking, putting prime ingredients on a sparely designed stage and letting them speak with minimum interference. His natural impulse is to clear away clutter, to clarify rather than obscure, to nudge gently rather than to push. Mr. White judges his flavors very finely. Grilled octopus and ceci beans, a nice textural contrast, come alive with a touch of hot pepper cooled off with fresh mint. A dollop of olive paste rounds out the appetizer. Bluefin tuna, flattened out into a plate-filling carpaccio, makes a mild fresh-fish canvas to which Mr. White applies some bright strokes of concentrated flavor: capers, Ligurian olives and shavings of bottarga, a pressed mullet roe. A drizzling of citrus oil pulls all the loose ends together. It also puts a a high gloss on the tuna. These arrows pointing back to the main ingredient can be quite ingenious. Tender slices of duck breast, fanned around the plate and scattered with toasted hazelnuts, come with a discreet spoonful or two of mostardo, mustard-cured citrus peel simmered in syrup, which looks like marmalade and does the work of hot chutney. Mustard seed and mustard oil give off a flash of heat that cuts right through the duck fat. The pastas at Fiamma, with the exception of dull, rather mushy gnocchi with fava beans and morels, are exceptional. Two deserve special mention, raviolini stuffed with braised veal shank in a potent, highly reduced veal sauce enriched with formaggio de fossa, a cave-aged cheese from Emilia-Romagna, and broad bands of spinach pasta tossed with braised rabbit Bolognese in a Parmesan cream sauce. In both pastas, the meat, through slow cooking, becomes meltingly tender, saturated with braising flavors. Main courses at Italian restaurants can often be a bit of a letdown. Brilliant appetizers and life-changing pastas lead to hearty but not particularly memorable grilled branzino, second-class steak Florentine and monumental but desiccated veal chops. Saut\u00e9ed broccoli rabe often carries the weight. Mr. White knows how to hold his audience, most impressively in the custardlike timbale of squab liver that comes with rosemary roasted squab with porcini mushrooms. This is a dish that demands the biggest Barolo or brunello on the wine list. The Fiamma veal chop, perfumed with sage, is visually impressive, a big player on the plate, but Mr. White heads off veal fatigue by supplying handsomely caramelized sweet and sour cipollini onions and flavorful asparagus roasted, sliced into thin lengths and wrapped like a sheaf in a slice of prosciutto. Branzino, or sea bass, is often given perfunctory treatment, seared, anointed with some olive oil and served with a few olives. Mr. White elevates the fish. It's served with fava beans, fennel and brussels sprouts in a light, beguiling, very fragrant sauce using lemon must.",

        "article": "President Obama has often trimmed his ideas to what he thinks he might possibly get from an opposition that intends to give him nothing. So it is a relief to see him demanding that Congress do what the country really needs. On Sept. 8, Mr. Obama proposed a $447 billion job-creation initiative, and on Monday, he proposed a sensible package of tax increases to pay for it \u2014 saying, in essence, that a sane fiscal policy requires more careful government spending now and eventually higher taxes. Congressional Republicans initially offered a cautious reaction to the jobs bill. But once Mr. Obama talked about taxes, they lost all restraint. For all the caterwauling from Republicans about the budget deficit, the House majority leader, Eric Cantor, said paying for the plan would amount to a tax on \u201cjob creators.\u201d The Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, said the tax proposals were dead on arrival \u2014 his reaction to anything Mr. Obama has proposed since Inauguration Day. Now it is up to Mr. Obama to sell the public on his approach, something the White House has not done well. It will be a test of whether Mr. Obama will aggressively take on his opposition as the 2012 elections approach. The president is offering job-creation policies to take effect as soon as Congress passes the bill, paired with tax increases, mostly on the top 2 percent of households that make more than $250,000 a year, starting in 2013. Broadly, the package offers a weak economy stimulus in the short run and deficit reduction in the longer run. It is also sound in its particulars. By targeting the tax increases on high-end earners, any hit to economic growth can be offset by using the new revenue to pay for programs that have a bigger impact on economic activity than leaving the money in richer Americans\u2019 pockets. When he laid out his jobs plan last week, Mr. Obama powerfully presented a series of choices \u2014 a status quo of high unemployment, deteriorating human capital and crumbling infrastructure or a renewed push for recovery and relief measures to get the economy moving again. That means choosing between a tax system that coddles the rich or reorienting the code in favor of the middle class. The tax increases Mr. Obama has recommended are a step in the direction of middle-class prosperity. The largest part would raise some $400 billion over 10 years by capping the value of itemized deductions and other tax breaks at 28 percent. That would mean higher taxes for the minority of taxpayers who will be paying 36 percent and 39.6 percent when the Bush tax cuts expire at the end of 2012. The majority of taxpayers, who pay a top rate of 28 percent or less, would be unaffected. Republicans can object all they want. But the proposed cap is much less stringent than the ones proposed by prominent deficit reduction panels, including the bipartisan Bowles-Simpson committee. It is also fair tax policy. Under current law, the largest subsidies go to people who need them least \u2014 for such things as mortgage interest and charitable giving \u2014 because the value of tax breaks rises as income and tax rates rise. Capping such breaks helps to ensure that subsidies are focused on Americans who need them most. The other parts of Mr. Obama\u2019s proposed tax increases would raise money while making the code more fair: $41 billion by ending tax breaks for oil and gas companies; $18 billion by not letting private equity partners pay tax on most earnings at about the lowest rate in the code; and $3 billion by curbing breaks for corporate jets. Mr. Obama\u2019s proposals, including the taxes to pay for them, could not be more urgent. There is a crater in the economy where the job market used to be.",

        "article": "So New York City FC have their first player, and given that he's the all-time leading international Spanish goalscorer, and a player who just played 120 minutes of the Champions League final, you might assume he's a good one \u2014 at least for those not engaged in the active revisionism that goes on when a player has the temerity to cross the Atlantic. David Villa was officially revealed as a City player by teleconference from New York on Monday lunchtime, while the player himself was still in midair, en route to join up with his Spanish team-mates in Washington where he will begin preparations for his third World Cup. After the announcement of local hero, and former US and Manchester City man, Claudio Reyna as Director of Soccer, and the brightest young technical coach in MLS, Jason Kreis, as the first head coach, NYC were able to pull off a trio of strong first impressions on the footballing side with the confirmation of Villa as their marquee signing. Immediate reaction online ranged from European puzzlement to expectation that Villa would instantly dominate MLS. He'd be in a minority among big name arrivals if he does, though like the most notable example of a player who hit the ground running, Robbie Keane, Villa's movement and finishing will give him every opportunity to do well from the start. As for the puzzlement, when Villa arrived in D.C., he may have been surprised to learn from some of the reaction outside the USA that in midair he'd gone from being a free agent at Atletico who was being courted by top clubs around Europe, to having added five years' worth of wear and tear to his legs and that he'd officially landed in the retirement home by signing for NYC. That's still the absurd sort of claim that even the best players go through when making the journey to MLS, in its continuing fight for global credibility. And while there may be merit in any case-by-case analysis that concludes that a player has sold himself short in any one move to any club, anywhere, the blanket assertions about the league, its prospects and the meaning of any European player's move there, don't do justice to MLS's steady emergence as a destination in the post-David Beckham years, and its sometimes painful but discernible integration into the global market, from its first \"state of exception\" era. And in Villa's case, they don't do justice to a player with a global reputation who has taken on a significant risk (albeit one with a significant upside for his legacy should it work) in one of the toughest sports markets in the world. New York sports fans are notoriously indifferent to reputation \u2014 and the type of \"what have you done for me lately?\" pressure Villa could experience might have come as a surprise had he been the type expecting to collect checks and sign a few autographs in an extended dotage. But the player who survived a tough stint at Barcelona and who has plundered 56 international goals for Spain in an era when teams mass ranks to prevent them scoring, is not shy of a challenge. Indeed, his personal virtues were referenced as much as his technical ones when City announced his arrival. Yes, money is a factor, and when the MLS players union publishes their biannual salary report next spring, expect to see Villa very well compensated, as global players in their early 30s go. And it's unlikely Jermain Defoe or even Michael Bradley would have \"relished the challenge\" in Toronto quite as much without the significant number of zeroes on their pay checks. But since the designated player rule, ushered in by Beckham's arrival at LA Galaxy in June 2007, and which now allows clubs to sign up to three players (plus so-called junior designated players), the profile of the average big name signing in MLS has begun to shift, and Villa, at 32 and still with plenty to offer, has become part of a newer paradigm. The likes of Beckham (eventually), Thierry Henry, Robbie Keane, and Tim Cahill, have been, or will be, around in their sides long enough to have teams built round them, as Seattle and Toronto will now do with Clint Dempsey and Bradley/Defoe respectively. Villa too, will expect to be the spearhead of a style of play inspired by NYC parent club Manchester City (whose youth ranks will help swell NYC squads through loans). Not every player who arrives matches that strategic blueprint. Marco Di Vaio and Alessandro Nesta arrived with quality, but in the latter's case, little left in the tank when he came to Montreal Impact. And ironically, the other player linked with NYCFC, Frank Lampard, through his age and his diminishing powers, is more reminiscent of the one-last-payday style signing the league lived through in the 1990s especially. All these big name choices represent an opportunity and a challenge. An ageing marquee name might help market a team in the short term, and may even add steadiness on the field within a brief tenure. Nesta's role in Montreal's defense for example, was at least as important as Di Vaio's goals in getting them to their first playoff campaign last year. And the same defense fell off alarmingly when he retired. But in New York City's case, with the need to come out of the gate with a credible statement signing, the club's foregrounding of Villa as the archetype of a New York City player, was an important and necessary decision. Lampard would have (will have) the same level of global interest upon signing, but from a technical standpoint wouldn't have made the same impression as an initial statement of intent beyond the first year. Jason Kreis spoke in the press conference of his personal satisfaction of landing a player who typified all of the technical footballing virtues he and Claudio Reyna prize. Kreis's Real Salt Lake sides worked hard on both sides of the ball, were technically proficient and were possessed of clinical finishers. Villa is an exemplar in these respects. A Brazil v Spain World Cup final could feature a NYCFC striker up against a Toronto FC goalkeeper..... And for New York City, starting play in the Bronx, the signing of a high-profile player with a direct appeal to the crucial Hispanic market was an equally important statement just before the spike in interest of a World Cup. That will be just one of the \"checked boxes\" Reyna and Kreis claim to have ticked off before this signing. For another, check the box marked \"Unfazed by opinions in Europe.\"",

        "article": "The nuclear deal with Iran will unleash economic forces that make it unenforceable. Tehran will become the dominant economic and military power in the Middle East and if it chooses, build nuclear weapons. President Obama held together a broad international coalition that imposed tough economic sanctions. Restrictions on the sale of oil and access to international banks imposed double digit unemployment and inflation and compelled Iran to negotiate. Finding buyers for oil shipped via 3 million barrel supertankers was one thing, but the inability to transfer funds through western banks made securing $150 million payments quite another. Obama sought to dismantle Tehran\u2019s nuclear infrastructure\u2014including underground centrifuge machines, capable of enriching uranium into fissionable material. Tehran resisted but events in the region made Obama desperate for a deal\u2014the rise of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, its spinoff in Libya, and deteriorating relations with Israel and Saudi Arabia on issues transcending the Iranian nuclear challenge. Boeing, French oil company Total and German industry group BDI see vast opportunities in the Iran market, and the surge of European, Chinese and American investment into Iran will be similar to the Gold Rush that created modern California. The agreement significantly circumscribes Iranian nuclear activity but only limits Tehran\u2019s ability to quickly \u201cbreak out\u201d from restrictions and accumulate enough fissionable material to create a nuclear weapon in less than one year. We are told that is enough time for the West to detect Iranian violations and respond\u2014but it is not. The lifting of economic sanctions will create an economic superpower with malevolent, anti-Western aspirations. Iran has a well-educated population of 80 million\u2014with a large middle class and many engineers and business leaders who studied in the West. It has the oil reserves of Saudi Arabia, the natural gas reserves of Russia, the mineral resources of Australia\u2014including iron ore, bauxite, cooper, and the world\u2019s largest supply of zinc\u2014sophisticated manufacturing and a stock market with strong corporate reporting requirements In 2010, Iran produced 1.6 million automobiles through indigenous manufacturers and joint ventures with western firms. Although sanctions pushed that number down to 1 million in 2014, autos are among the most difficult and complex mass production items to make, and Iran\u2019s technological potential could quickly put it in the same class as South Korea. Iran provides Western Europe and China with an alternative to Russian natural gas. Boeing, French oil company Total and German industry group BDI see vast opportunities in the Iran market, and the surge of European, Chinese and American investment into Iran will be remindful of the Gold Rush that created modern California. Once those euros, yuan and dollars are in, political pressures will make it tough to re-impose western economic sanctions. Were Iran to start making weapons grade material, western actions would be preceded by talks. But as with Russia in the Ukraine, Europe\u2019s largest economy, Germany, would be cautious about losing access to Iranian natural gas and its other commercial interests, and similar distractions would impede other European and Asian cooperation. The U.S. trump card has been its unique grip on the global banking and payments system, but China\u2019s success in recruiting European allies to join its Asian Infrastructure Bank demonstrates that Asian alternatives to U.S. dominated western financial institutions will soon emerge. Even as sanctions handicapped Iran, it has projected power directly and through surrogates in Lebanon, Iraq, Yemen and elsewhere. Once the Iranian industrial juggernaut gets rolling, a society with an anti-western theocratic bent, sophisticated technology and manufacturing industries, and the resource wealth of Saudi Arabia, Russia and Australia combined will emerge as an economic and military power on a par with our European allies. Ultimately, Iranian nuclear aspirations will prove awfully difficult to contain within 12 months with U.S. threats to assemble an international coalition to take military action or impose sanctions. A decade from now, if UN inspectors discover Iran is building a nuclear weapon, western leaders will ask how they could have let this happen. In all likelihood Barack Obama will still be around. Perhaps he will offer some answers. Peter Morici served as Chief Economist at the U.S. International Trade Commission from 1993 to 1995.

        "article": "Dusting your house is a tedious but necessary exercise. Sabrina Fierman, vice president of New York-based cleaning company, New York's Little Elves, says the build-up of dust can lead to allergies, respiratory problems and asthma. Though it may seem like a simple task, many of us still get it wrong. What might look like cleaning, may actually be spreading dust around, allowing it resettle elsewhere in the room. Here's the proper way to dust your house from top to bottom. Remove everythingIn order to perform a thorough dusting, you'll need to \"de-clutter\" the room of any smaller and unnecessary items, says Fierman. This should allow you dust even the most hard-to-reach places without having to strain yourself. If your household items (picture frames, wall clocks) have accumulated dust, don't forget to clean them before putting them back. To dust the room entirely, closets should also be cleared and items should be removed from drawers. Any rugs or other floor accessories should also be brought outside. Start dustingNow that your room is bare, you can begin dusting. Dampen a dust cloth and begin dusting at the highest points in the room first. This is crucial, as any dust that falls down to a lower surface will be swept up later if you keep working downwards. Choose one direction - either clockwise or counterclockwise - and stick to it as you move throughout the room to ensure that you don't skip any areas. When you notice your dust cloth beginning to accumulate excess dust, be sure to shake it off outside before continuing. Clean even the out-of-reach placesEncountering a difficult-to-reach spot or two is inevitable in almost every room. Whether it's behind the television, under the couch or on top of the cabinet, it's important not to overlook these problematic areas. If you can't move some of the larger pieces of furniture, a small clean paintbrush is perfect for reaching into the surrounding nooks. Vacuum cleaner attachments can also help when tackling hard-to-reach spots, says Fierman. If you encounter any dust or cobwebs on the ceilings or walls, try using a damp mop or brush to clean it off. Furniture and floorsTo keep dust from resettling quickly, it's important not to forget the furniture. Use a vacuum cleaner to clean the upholstery of the couch and any other fabric furniture. Once everything else has been dusted, you can begin cleaning the floor. Use a mop for hard floors and a vacuum cleaner for carpets and make sure that you don't miss any out-of-the-way spots in the corner or under the furniture. Tips for bathroomsBathrooms usually generate more encrusted dirt, so be sure to use a sponge of chamois to clean off tiles and other surfaces. Don't forget about the little nooks under and behind the toilet and sink. If you encounter any particularly tough dirt, try tackling it with an old toothbrush. Tips for kitchensWhen dusting a kitchen, you'll need to remove everything from your cabinets and clean them from top to bottom with a duster or damp cloth. Clean all counter tops with a cloth or sponge and don't forget to dust on the underside if necessary. Tables and chairs should also be dusted or vacuumed thoroughly.",

        "article": "A citywide curfew that went into effect late Tuesday until early Wednesday brought calm to Baltimore in the wake of riots that spotlighted deep tension between police and the community and drew parallels to the unrest of 1968. But now that the city is picking up the pieces, thanks in part to thousands of National Guardsmen and law enforcement officers who will enforce the curfew for several more nights, the question for Baltimore officials and residents is how to prevent all this from happening again. Protesters in Baltimore marched for several hours ahead of Wednesday night\u2019s curfew at 10 p.m., at which time lines of law enforcement officers and others in armored vehicles set out to keep the streets clear until 5 a.m. Elsewhere, in New York City and Washington, D.C., large groups of demonstrators amassed in shows of support for Baltimore and against police brutality. Monday\u2019s violence arose from rising tensions following the April 19 death of Freddie Gray, 25, who suffered a severe spinal injury after a confrontation with police a week earlier. Gray\u2019s death became the latest instance of a black man\u2019s death at the hands of a law enforcement officer reigniting the national conversation about race and police force, just as other incidents in South Carolina, Ferguson and New York City, among others, had done since last summer. To avoid widespread protests and incidents like what occurred with Gray, experts say Baltimore will likely need to address several long-standing issues: the patterns of segregation that still exist throughout the city; the lack of opportunity in predominantly black neighborhoods; and the long-standing mistrust between police and minorities. Baltimore has a history and pattern of racial segregation that began more than a century ago, and its shadows still linger. In 1910, the city adopted a policy mandating that black residents couldn\u2019t live on a block where more than half the residents were white. While the policy was later struck down as unconstitutional, Baltimore remains starkly divided along similar racial lines that originate from those socioeconomic boundaries. Gray was arrested in one of the poorest neighborhoods, Sandtown-Winchester. A fifth of its residents are unemployed and a third of its homes sit vacant. It has about twice as many liquor stores as the city average, according to a 2011 report by the Baltimore City Health Department, and 25% of juveniles living there were arrested between 2005 and 2009. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the most disinvested neighborhoods in our city,\u201d says Lawrence Brown, a community activist and professor of health policy at Morgan State University. Baltimore\u2019s Inner Harbor, meanwhile, is bustling with shops and tourist attractions. Seema Iyer, a University of Baltimore economics professor, says the areas around the Inner Harbor grew by about 15% to 20% between 2000 and 2010. Still, it is predominantly white. Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake has focused on lowering the property tax rate to lure homeowners into the city while also implementing a tax on soda bottles to help fund reinvestment of public schools. It\u2019s all part of her goal to bring 10,000 families new families into Baltimore by 2020. \u201cYou have to have a broader tax base to have a sustainable city,\u201d says Bill Cole, president of the Baltimore Development Corporation. But the problem is that most people moving to the city aren\u2019t looking to relocate into neighborhoods that could benefit the most from new businesses setting up or families moving in. \u201cThere\u2019s still gross underdevelopment where Mr. Gray is from,\u201d says Jamal Bryant, pastor of the Empowerment Temple AME Church in Baltimore. \u201cRome isn\u2019t built in a day, but we at least want to get to Venice to see some levels of progress in these urban centers.\u201d The city has instituted a program called Vacants to Value in which the city buys up properties, refurbishes them and attempts to resell them. There are 16,000 vacant home within Baltimore; city officials acknowledge they have demolished or rehabilitated 3,000 so far, but experts say many residents don\u2019t want to live in those properties even if they\u2019re refurbished. \u201cThe unfortunate thing is there is no demand for them,\u201d says Barbara Samuels, a lawyer for the ACLU of Maryland, who has worked on housing issues. Samuels says the city should provide more opportunities for people to leave those neighborhoods and \u201cgo to an area that\u2019s not racially or economically segregated.\u201d Baltimore\u2019s population, which steadily declined for decades, appears to have stabilized in recent years, settling in at around 600,000. But the poorest neighborhoods have remained stagnant, or even declined. Those patterns of segregation and a divide between haves and have-nots have led to years of animosity between residents and police. Last year, the Baltimore Sun reported the city had paid out almost $6 million between 2011 and 2014 to residents, many of them black, that police officers had abused. The city has paid out $45 million for \u201crough rides\u201d in police vans, like what many believe occurred with Gray, following two incidents in which those arrested were paralyzed. Another problem may stem from the fact that only a quarter of Baltimore police actually live in the city, one of the lowest rates in the country, according to Census data analyzed by FiveThirtyEight. The rest live either in Baltimore County or out of the state, and that can have an unintended effect on how police do their jobs. Some local activists are pushing for the police department to recruit more officers from within the city, believing it could change how local residents interact with the officers patrolling their neighborhoods\u201d on the police from out of town \u201cPolice used to know everything on the block. The people who did hair, the people who had the best gossip,\u201d says Cortley Witherspoon, a Baltimore religious leader and social activist. \u201cBut now, people are coming in with culture shock. We need to make sure officers come from the city that they are patrolling.\u201d City Council President Jack Young says he believes that each officer for the first two years on the job should reside in Baltimore. \u201cThey should live in the city,\u201d he adds, simply. One change that could potentially help Baltimore heal is if residents start to feel that police are being held accountable for their actions. \u201cYou have to have justice where people who have committed these kinds of acts are fired,\u201d says Brown, of Morgan State. \u201cThe city is settling time and time again instead of punishing these officers. There is a history of violence in this police department, but they\u2019re never held accountable.\u201d The city\u2019s first test on that count will come Friday, when police will turn over its investigation into Gray\u2019s death to the state\u2019s attorney general. A second test could come the next day, when a rally is expected to draw thousands of people back into the streets.",

        "article": "William Turnbull, a major artist of the British postwar era who enjoyed success as a sculptor, painter and printmaker, has died at the age of 90. The son of a Dundee shipyard engineer, Turnbull's output ranged from figurative sculpture through to steel-based minimalist sculpture and abstract painting, while his works are held in major public collections including the Tate, the National Galleries of Scotland and various collections in the US. After beginning his career as an illustrator for the Scottish publishing company DC Thomson, he became an RAF pilot and saw service during the second world war. He returned to London in 1950 before having his first major exhibition at the Hanover Gallery in 1952, also participating during the same year in a seminal exhibition, New Aspects of British Sculpture, at the Venice Biennale. It was during the mid-1950s that he also became a protagonist in the influential 'Independent Group' of painters, sculptors, architects and writers who met at the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) in London. Regarded by some as a precursor of the pop art movement, the group included Richard Hamilton, Eduardo Paolozzi, James Stirling and Colin St John Wilson. Turnbull was also one of the first artists to embrace American abstract expressionism, creating lasting relationships with Mark Rothko and Barnett Newman. He exhibited extensively over the last 60 years, while the Chatsworth House Trust is to present a major exhibition of his work next year. The director of the Tate, Nicholas Serota, said: \"William Turnbull was an exceptional artist, unusually gifted both as a painter and a sculptor. Initially, his distinctive sculpture developed in response to his stay as a young man in postwar Paris, where he met Giacometti, Brancusi and Helion among many others.\" \"It matured through his admiration for the simple forms of ancient and eastern cultures and his abiding search for the essence in any object. In this he came close to the purity of Barnett Newman, or to his own contemporaries such as Ellsworth Kelly. However, his sculpture and painting always had a humanist sensibility that identified it as profoundly European.\" Turnbull, who died on Thursday, was the subject last year of a documentary called Beyond Time: William Turnbull, which was released by one of his sons, Alex. Narrated by the actor Jude Law, it re-evaluated the legacy of an often secretive artist who never quite became a household name. As well as Alex, Turnbull is also survived by another son, Johnny. They are his children by his second wife, the sculptor and printmaker Kim Lim, who died of cancer aged 59 in 1997.",

        "article": "Man ruled and machine drooled Monday, as Joe Nedney, a placekicker for the San Francisco 49ers, beat Ziggy the battle robot in a field-goal kicking competition at Kezar Stadium. The lighthearted contest, a stunt to highlight the three-day RoboGames competition that opens Friday at the San Mateo County Fairgrounds, ended when Nedney easily kicked a football 45 yards while his mechanical adversary twice failed to clear the goalposts at that distance. \"It definitely legitimizes my position,\" said Nedney, a Bay Area native who once played college ball at San Jose State University. \"I feel pretty good about myself right now.\" Ziggy's human handlers - South Bay engineers Mike Phillips, Mike Hermann, Mohan Gurunathan and Edward Ayrapetian - left the field humbled. \"In practice yesterday we were kicking 60 yards,\" Phillips said. Ziggy is a 340-pound tortoise-shaped contraption designed to destroy opposing battle bots by flipping them over with a powerful pneumatic-powered scoop. Its creators, most of whom work for the San Jose engineering firm Nuvation, recently realized the scoop could also hurl a football downfield and, after a few beers and practice kicks, cooked up the contest. \"I'm all about shameless publicity,\" quipped RoboGames promoter David Calkins, who is opening the paid event to free, school-organized tours on Friday to interest young people in a field that is quickly moving from fiction to reality. The notion of powerful automatons goes far back in human cultures and includes concepts like the golem, an animated clay figure from Hebrew tradition. The word robot itself was coined in 1921 when Czech playwright Karel Capek used \"robota\" to describe a group of soulless automatons designed to do grunt work that rise up and destroy their creators. Long a staple of science fiction, robots have slowly percolated into industry, performing repetitive assembly-line tasks with unerring efficiency. Robots have also been sent into battlefields on bomb disposal missions in Iraq. Unmanned aerial vehicles, piloted by ground-based operators, have been used with deadly if controversial effect in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Military interest in the field partly explains the existence of the Congressional Robotics Caucus, whose 23 Democratic and 10 Republican members recently set aside partisan differences to designate April 10-18 as the first-ever national robotics week. Private financiers are starting to get into the field, said Dan Kara, editor of RoboticsTrends.com in Massachusetts. \"We've had six or seven different companies out of the Boston area funded by venture capitalists, all with a civilian focus,\" Kara said. These include Corindus Vascular, a startup that has raised $9 million to develop surgical systems, he said. In the Bay Area, Willow Garage, a privately funded research firm in Menlo Park, is using the \"open source\" method that developed the Linux software for PCs to create a Robot Operating System to control functions such as locomotion and gripping. \"It's an exciting time,\" said Brian Gerkey of Willow Garage, which is building some 20 research robots and distributing these to academic scientists for them to make - and share - software to increase the machines' capabilities. Most robots remain awkward and clumsy compared with humans, as evidenced by Ziggy, the reigning champion of the popular battle bot competition at RoboGames. The three-day event is like a county fair for the 667 amateur robot-builders who will flock to San Mateo to compete for bragging rights in more than 50 separate events, many of them whimsical, such as the drink-mixing competition between bartender bots. Some competitions do suggest practical applications. Calkins said contests between firefighting automatons could create alternatives to sprinkler systems that extinguish fires but can cause indiscriminate water damage. But for the most part, competitors seem intent on learning from experience - as evidenced by Phillips, one of Ziggy's handlers, who answered thus when asked what he expected from Monday's contest: \"This robot is completely out of its league kicking a ball, but it's a lot of fun. ... We found weak spots we didn't know we had kicking a football.\" Tales of such face-offs, legendary and otherwise, include: John Henry: The perhaps apocryphal tale of a hammer-wielding railroad worker who battled a steam-powered drilling machine and won the contest, only to die from the effort. Deep Blue: The IBM chess-playing super computer beat then-world champion Garry Kasparov, left, in a 1997 match that made history. Finance and poker: IBM researchers said in 2001 that robotic commodities traders made more money than humans in a test. More recently, poker-playing robots have been developed, but it is not clear how they would deal with bluffs.",

Yet a slight ironic adjustment connects the movie\u2019s main song to its themes, one of which is that everything sucks. As cute and energetic as it is, \u201cThe Lego Movie\u201d is more exhausting than fun, too unsure of itself to stick with any story thread for too long. The action scenes are enthusiastic, colorful but uninvolving, like an 8-year-old emptying a bucket of plastic blocks. A wise old prophet (Morgan Freeman) is overcome by the villainous, corporatist Lord Business (Will Ferrell), who seizes the evil weapon the \u201cKragle,\u201d which turns out to be Krazy Glue, that threatens to cement everybody in place. Lego world, the wizard says, can be saved from the Kragle only by an unsuspecting random guy dubbed \u201cthe Special\u201d who turns out to be Emmet (Chris Pratt), an oafish construction worker. Emmet\u2019s a likable chap who doesn\u2019t deserve the insults thrown his way by everyone else \u2014 not just a ruthless cop (Liam Neeson) on his trail, but a butt-kicking avenger Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) who rescues him and her boyfriend, Lego Batman (Will Arnett, doing an amusing growl). Even Batman gets in on the action in \u201cThe Lego Movie.\u201dPhoto: Warner Bros. Pictures The humor ranges from slapstick to rapid-fire pop allusions that are \u201cSimpsons\u201d-style, but not \u201cSimpsons\u201d-caliber. Much of the latter consists of meta-jokes (a Green Lantern voiced by Jonah Hill sucks up to a jockish Superman voiced by Channing Tatum; a line of dialogue goes \u201cblah blah blah proper name place name back-story stuff\u201d) or feeble little stabs of satire. Asked for his favorite eatery, everyman Emmet says, \u201cAny chain restaurant.\u201d Because . . . no little kid would be caught dead in one of those? Here is a movie in which a $15 billion toy merchant and a $57 billion entertainment conglomerate join forces to lecture us on the evils of buying. Despite lots of gags about how dull and conformist Emmet\u2019s world is, the anti-consumerist drum isn\u2019t beaten to shreds the way it was in \u201cThe Lorax.\u201d But none of the other ideas work very well, either. Digitally animated to look like the stop-motion process behind those Gen-X beloved 1960s cartoons, the film is lovingly detailed, but spoofs are better suited to sketch comedy. They tend to grow monotonous at length. The old stop-motion productions loved their characters and developed stories in scenes backed by what now looks like Shakespearean patience, whereas \u201cThe Lego Movie\u201d is all toddler-meets-Red-Bull chaos. The experience is like being trapped inside a popcorn popper. Not until the very end, with an awkward pullback from the toys to the boy playing with them, is there even an attempt to deliver some \u201cToy Story\u201d heart, but the theme of this final act (that Legos aren\u2019t for grown-ups) is about as profound as a Trix commercial. I picture Buzz Lightyear watching \u201cThe Lego Movie\u201d and announcing, \u201cStar command, request evacuation pod immediately.

        "article": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Americans are getting older, but not this old: Social Security records show that 6.5 million people in the U.S. have reached the ripe old age of 112. In reality, only few could possibly be alive. As of last fall, there were only 42 people known to be that old in the entire world. But Social Security does not have death records for millions of these people, with the oldest born in 1869, according to a report by the agency's inspector general. Only 13 of the people are still getting Social Security benefits, the report said. But for others, their Social Security numbers are still active, so a number could be used to report wages, open bank accounts, obtain credit cards or claim fraudulent tax refunds. \"That is a real problem,\" said Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis. \"When you have a fake Social Security number, that's what allows you to fraudulently do all kinds things, claim things like the earned income tax credit or other tax benefits.\" Johnson is chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, which plans a hearing Monday on problems with death records maintained by the Social Security Administration. The agency said it is working to improve the accuracy of its death records. But it would be costly and time-consuming to update 6.5 million files that were generated decades ago, when the agency used paper records, said Sean Brune, a senior adviser to the agency's deputy commissioner for budget, finance, quality and management. \"The records in this review are extremely old, decades-old, and unreliable,\" Brune said. The internal watchdog's report does not document any fraudulent or improper payments to people using these Social Security numbers. But it raises red flags that it could be happening. For example, nearly 67,000 of the Social Security numbers were used to report more than $3 billion in wages, tips and self-employment income from 2006 to 2011, according to the report. One Social Security number was used 613 different times. An additional 194 numbers were used at least 50 times each. People in the country illegally often use fake or stolen Social Security numbers to get jobs and report wages, as do other people who do not want to be found by the government. Thieves use stolen Social Security numbers to claim fraudulent tax refunds. The IRS estimated it paid out $5.8 billion in fraudulent tax refunds in 2013 because of identity theft. The head of the Justice Department's tax division described how it's done at a recent congressional hearing. \"The plan is frighteningly simple \u2014 steal Social Security numbers, file tax returns showing a false refund claim, and then have the refunds electronically deposited or sent to an address where the offender can access the refund checks,\" said acting Assistant Attorney General Caroline Ciraolo. In some cases, she said, false tax returns are filed using Social Security numbers of deceased taxpayers or others who are not required to file. The Social Security Administration generates a list of dead people to help public agencies and private companies know when Social Security numbers are no longer valid for use. The list is called the Death Master File, which includes the name, Social Security number, date of birth and date of death for people who have died. The list is widely used by employers, financial firms, credit reporting agencies and security firms. Federal agencies and state and local governments rely on it to police benefit payments. But none of the 6.5 million people cited by the inspector general's report was on the list. The audit analyzed records as of 2013, looking for people with birth dates before 1901. President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act in 1935, and the first old-age monthly benefit check was paid in 1940. Many of the people cited in the inspector general's report never received benefits, though they were assigned Social Security numbers so spouses and children could receive them, presumably after they died. The agency says it has corrected death information in more than 200,000 records. But fixing the entire list would be costly and time-consuming because Social Security needs proof that a person is dead to add them to the death list, said Brune, the agency official. Brune noted that the inspector general's report did not verify that any of the 6.5 million people are actually dead. Instead, the report assumed they are dead because of their advanced age. \"We can't post information to our records based on presumption,\" Brune said. \"We post information to our records based on evidence, and in this case it would be evidence of a death certificate.\" \"Some of those records may not even exist,\" Brune added. Nearly all the Social Security numbers are from paper records generated before the agency started using electronic records in 1972, Brune said. Many of the records contain errors, with multiple birthdates and bits of information about different family members. \"We did transcribe paper records into the electronic system and over time that information's been purified,\" Brune said. \"But our focus right now is to make sure our data is as accurate and complete as it can be for our current program purpose,\" said Brune. \"Right now, we're focused on making sure we're paying beneficiaries properly, and that's how we're investing our resources at this time.\"",

        "article": "It may not have the same allure as Yoenis Cespedes\u2019s three-wheeled rubber-burning whip, but after Jason Heyward got paid by the Chicago Cubs, he made sure his first big purchase was a meaningful one. Heyward signed an eight-year, $184 million contract with the Cubs this offseason after spending the first five years of his career with the Atlanta Braves and 2015 with the St. Louis Cardinals. The 26-year old outfielder has the proven production under his belt and presumably has plenty of years left in his career, so the signing, one of many for the Cubs, and securing of a potential offensive and defensive cornerstone was a no-brainer in Chicago. Cubs catcher David Ross, however, is entering a different stage of his career. Entering his 14th season, Ross has spent his time in the big leagues establishing himself not as a bona fide star but rather a serviceable backup who apparently has done wonders for locker rooms and young players in the role of a mentor. Despite not carrying the highest batting average, Cubs Manager Joe Maddon told MLB.com\u2019s Carrie Muskat that Ross was worth keeping around solely for his affect on the team\u2019s clubhouse atmosphere. \u201cToo many times you portray players as clubhouse leaders and that\u2019s done way too loosely for me,\u201d Maddon said. \u201cWith him, it\u2019s legitimate. He is a clubhouse leader. Despite not hitting .275 or better, he still maintains his stature in the clubhouse because of the respect people have for him for how he goes about his business. When he says something, it\u2019s pertinent and right on. \u201cI really don\u2019t care what he hits batting average-wise \u2014 it makes no difference to me,\u201d Maddon said. \u201cWhatever he hits is gravy for me, for us.\u201d The 38-year old has announced this will be his final season, bringing an end to the journeyman\u2019s tenure in the MLB \u2014 Ross has played for seven clubs in 14 seasons. In that time, Ross has likely assisted dozens of young players, including a fateful turn with the Atlanta Braves in 2010, the same year Heyward made his rookie debut. It was Ross\u2019s actions that season that have seemed to have deeply resonated with the Cubs\u2019 new slugger, as Heyward used his latest paycheck to make life comfortable for the veteran. As an act of gratitude for Ross\u2019s mentorship during his first standout campaign, Heyward has upgraded all of Ross\u2019 hotel rooms to suites for the upcoming season, a move that has really stuck with the backup catcher through all the kind gestures that came upon his announcement. Per MLB.com: \u201cThat\u2019s one of the first emotional moments I had in the offseason,\u201d Ross said. \u201c[Heyward] texted me this nice long message about supposedly what I\u2019ve done for him. That was cool to start reflecting back and people you\u2019ve played with start saying nice things.\u201d The move is an uplifting one and proof of the impact \u201cglue guys\u201d and locker room leaders can have on a team. Now, with Ross made comfortable, all that\u2019s left for the J-Hey Kid is the simple task of gifting a World Series title to the Cubs.

        "article": "In an earlier blog, I asked \u2013 rhetorically \u2013 if you were worth $40,000 an hour (or up), the amount that a top professional speaker can earn in an hour giving a keynote speech. But what should you actually charge for speaking? Most people at the early end of their speaking careers probably respond with \u201cGee, thanks!\u201d when someone calls them to ask them to speak. That doesn\u2019t put you in a very strong negotiating position. What should you ask for? And indeed, if you\u2019re speaking primarily to promote your business \u2013 say, you\u2019re offering a seminar on tax preparation in hopes of generating new clients for your accounting firm \u2013 then you should speak for free. But if you decide to make a paying business out of it, then you have to figure out what the market will bear, where you stand in that marketplace, and what you will charge so as neither to drive too many people away nor to leave too much money on the table. Here are some guidelines to help you do that, in the US market at least, as you get started. Think like a real estate agent, especially at first. Real estate agents are forever facing the delicate task of explaining to the proud homeowners that the home that they love isn\u2019t worth as much as they want it to be on the open market. Especially when you\u2019re starting out, you don\u2019t have much experience, and you haven\u2019t established a track record of successful speeches, it\u2019s better to begin on the low end. The issue is that if you price yourself too low, you\u2019ll send out a message of low quality. One way to get around that is to say, early on, \u201cI don\u2019t charge for my speaking, per se, but I do get paid an honorarium of $X,000 plus expenses.\u201d When you\u2019re ready to start really charging, then I would recommend beginning at the $5,000 level (plus travel), because that\u2019s the level that serious speaking commences. Then publish your book. As I\u2019ve blogged about before, a book is still necessary to sustain most professional speaking careers. Once you\u2019ve got a traditionally published book out, then you\u2019re in the $10K and up category. If the book sells well\u2026. You\u2019re ready to move up! New York Times bestselling authors regularly command fees of $40K and up, which is where I began. Then think like an airline. Separate out travel expenses from your fee. You might also discount specific amounts for book purchases, or add the book purchases to your fee. I tried to start a movement of giving out a comprehensive fee, since it can take time and bureaucracy to get your travel fees reimbursed, but the movement didn\u2019t get very far. People are so used to paying travel that I couldn\u2019t persuade them to do without. So instead, break those out of your fees. Finally, measure your fees by the market demand. If people are coming to you to ask you to speak, that means there\u2019s market demand. That\u2019s a far more persuasive position to negotiate from than if you\u2019ve started the conversation. Once you\u2019re getting calls, then keep raising the fees until you get pushback more than, say, 20 % of the time. Please take these numbers as guidelines only. For a whole host of reasons, this is not an exact science. Any market in which one former president commands fees of $250K and another of millions is one for which money in the end is not really the motivating factor. It\u2019s the desire to have the face time with the speaker. And that\u2019s not about an hour\u2019s work, or enough money to buy a car, or a really expensive house. That\u2019s about the right person providing an experience of the right kind for the right audience. What are your experiences charging for speaking? How did you decide upon your fees? I\u2019d love to hear from you on this tricky pricing question.",

        "article": "Benedict XVI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s visit to the U.S. will be watched closely by people in America and across the world. Many will flock to see him; seats at Yankee Stadium have already been sold out. However, the Pope is relatively new to the job and remains enigmatic and unpredictable on many issues. Most Americans and most around the globe still know little about this Pontiff. A skilled and experienced theologian, who was gatekeeper for Pope John Paul II on Catholic doctrine, he lacks his predecessor's skills in connecting with populations, in particular, with those who are not Catholics.\" Zealous conservative Catholics believe he has not been tough enough. Liberal Catholics fear a Pope who is concerned about the future of Catholicism imposing a theological conservatism that will further alienate or drive others out of the church. A recent Pew Forum report revealed that one-third of so-called \"cradle Catholics\" no longer identify themselves as Catholics. The Pope may be expected to reaffirm positions on abortion, stem cell research, and an overall \u00e2\u0080\u009cculture of life\u00e2\u0080\u009d against the culture of death. Conservative Catholics educators want him to deliver a strongly worded statement upholding orthodox Catholic teachings when he meets with leaders of Catholic universities and colleges. More liberal Catholics and educators, who are equally committed Catholics, fear such a statement would be a blunt instrument against a Catholic liberal arts education that includes freedom to engage, explore, and discuss controversial issues. Given the multi-religious and multi-ethnic nature of America, not only Catholics but also Jews, Protestants, Muslims, and members of other faiths and faith will be monitoring his comments on inter-religious relations. They generally perceive Benedict taking a more conservative approach to relations than John Paul II. To them, Benedict gives mixed messages. On the one hand the Pope reiterates positive Catholic teachings on inter-religious relations, delivered at warm personal meetings with religious leaders. On the other, he affirms conservative theological interpretations in statements and official documents that Protestants, Orthodox Christians, Jews, Muslims and others find offensive. The most prominent example of this vacillation involves Catholic-Muslim relations. Historically, the Vatican, especially through its Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue, has been a pioneer in Catholic-Muslim relations. From Pope Paul VI to John Paul II, Catholics and Muslims have engaged in international dialogue and made common cause on issues of mutual concern at major international conferences in Cairo and China. However, Benedict\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more conservative retreat became clear in an international uproar after his Regensberg lecture whose primary topic, the relationship between faith and reason, was completely overshadowed by reactions to four paragraphs about Islam. Two incorrect assertions regarding the Prophet Muhammad and the Quran\u00e2\u0080\u0099s relationship to violence and \u00e2\u0080\u009choly war\u00e2\u0080\u009d resulted in an international protest across the Muslim world. The Pope\u00e2\u0080\u0099s subsequent visit to Turkey helped to calm matters. Unfortunately, the Pope has continued to send mixed signals on relations with Islam. In March, the Vatican agreed to a meeting between the Pope and representatives of 138 Muslim religious leaders and scholars across the world who had issued an historic Open Letter, A Common Word Between Us and You. Some of them had already sent a respectful but substantive correction to Benedict a month after his Regensburg speech. The Open Letter, addressed to leaders of all the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s churches and to Christians everywhere, called for greater dialogue and cooperation based upon Islam and Christianity\u00e2\u0080\u0099s common ground, the two great commandments - love of God and love of the neighbor. However, soon after at this year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Easter Vigil mass at St. Peter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, the Pope\u00e2\u0080\u0099s baptized a controversial journalist with an Italian-Egyptian Muslim background, noted not only for his warnings about the threat of Muslim extremism but also for his unsubstantiated criticisms of Islam and Muslims. The Gallup World Poll, the largest and most comprehensive poll of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Muslims, representing the voices of one billion Muslims in 35 Muslim countries from Morocco to Indonesia, indicates widespread Muslim concern and resentment over what respondents see as the denigration of Islam and Muslims in the West. At the same time, these same Muslims indicate a desire for better relations based upon respect for Islam and Muslims. In a world in which majorities of Muslims globally feel under siege and in which Islamophobia is on the rise in America and Europe, many Muslims will be looking to see what Pope Benedict says in his meeting with inter-religious leaders. From a media and public relations point of view, any visit by a Pope can be dubbed historic. However, many will be listening to Benedict XVI to learn more about this new pope and the future direction of Catholicism affecting issues of doctrine and morality as well as inter-religious relations.

        "article": "Maybe you\u2019ve noticed it after a big run: Your sweat has a strong, cloying odor, sort of like a public restroom, perhaps. You may disregard it as an inevitable byproduct of a strenuous workout, but that ammonia smell may be a red flag your diet isn\u2019t keeping up with your energy needs. \u201cYour body normally metabolizes carbohydrates to create the fuel it requires for exercise,\u201d says Dr. William Roberts, a professor of sports and family medicine at the University of Minnesota. \u201cBut if you\u2019re exercising hard and don\u2019t have enough carbs to meet your body\u2019s needs, your system will switch over to protein metabolism.\u201d MORE: Is It Healthy To Sweat A Lot? When your body breaks down protein, ammonia is one of the byproducts, Roberts explains. Normally your liver would convert that ammonia into urea, a benign organic compound that your kidneys would dispel of in the form of urine. But if you\u2019re starved of carbs and turning to protein for most of your energy, your liver may not be able to handle all the ammonia your body produces. In those instances, your sweat becomes the vehicle through which your body jettisons all of the extra ammonia in your system. \u201cYou see this more in people who eat low-carb and high-protein diets, or people who are over-exercisers, like ultra marathoners,\u201d says Dr. Lewis Maharam, a New York-based physician and author of the Running Doc\u2019s Guide to Healthy Running. Maharam says dehydration can also contribute to the smell because it makes your sweat more concentrated. \u201cIf your urine is very dark yellow or brown, you\u2019re not drinking enough water, and that could be part of the reason you\u2019re smelling that ammonia.\u201d (He\u2019s quick to add that over-hydration is a more common issue among endurance athletes. If your pee is clear, drink less.) The big takeaway here is that ammonia-scented sweat is not normal or healthy. \u201cIf you\u2019re smelling ammonia in sweat, something\u2019s wrong,\u201d Maharam says. Both he and Roberts agree you need to add more carbohydrates to your diet. \u201cWhole fruits, potatoes, rice, pasta and breads are all traditional carb sources that should help correct the problem,\u201d Roberts says. If you\u2019re engaging in super-long workouts, sport drinks and bars tend to be carb heavy, so they can help your body avoid a switch to protein synthesis, Maharam adds. If adding carbs to your diet doesn\u2019t help, see a doctor. \u201cPeople with liver or kidney disease also have trouble disposing of ammonia,\u201d Roberts says. It\u2019s also possible people on protein-heavy diets\u2014such as Paleo\u2014may be overburdening their systems to the point that their sweat smells like ammonia, Maharam says. \u201cBalance is the key to health, especially when it comes to what you\u2019re eating,\u201d he adds. \u201cGoing to the extreme of all protein or all fat or all carbs\u2026none of those is good for you.\u201d",

Horn, always the most professorial of the three scholars, has for his part delivered the season's definitive encyclopedia nearly 500 profusely illustrated entries covering a rich art form from its rowdy 1890s beginnings (\"The Yellow Kid,\" etc.) through its golden age of the 1930s and '40s (\"Buck Rogers,\" \"Terry and the Pirates,\" \"Little Orphan Annie,\" etc.) to modern times' \"Calvin and Hobbes.\" Call this an essential reference for any student of the subject or simply a terrific present for Grandpa, who grew up reading these treasures the first time around. The name won't mean much to anybody who grew up after World War II, but there was a time when the Rev. Charles Coughlin meant as much to radio audiences as, say, Rush Limbaugh. He was a Catholic priest and firebrand preacher whose weekly addresses drew millions from the late '20s to 1940, when he was silenced by the Vatican. Today, he is often called the father of hate radio, because of his pioneer paranoid ranting (about Jewish bankers, liberals, FDR, etc.), but given the cast of populist and lunatic voices spawned by the Depression, author Donald Warren may have given Coughlin too much credit. No doubt, though, he was one of the more interesting and controversial figures of the times. Warren does not try to explain the private Coughlin, but he certainly explains his appeal and its place in pre-war politics. Bill Bell",

You love being in love. You may be swept away by your new lover's looks or other appealing physical attributes -- and disappointed when they change over time. Keep it healthy: Remember that true love doesn't recede with his hairline, and romance doesn't have to fade as the relationship matures. Plan dates, weekend getaways, or just-the-two-of-you vacations to rekindle the spark that ignited your relationship, suggests Pepper Schwartz, Ph.D., a sociology professor at the University of Washington in Seattle. Health.com: 6 trips that will bring you closer \"You have criteria that are important, and you won't change them,\" Schwartz says. Even if you're in a committed relationship, you may put too much pressure on your partner to live up to your standards. Keep it healthy: Let go of the list. Schwartz warns that clinging to those must-haves could mean a chafed relationship or a lonely life. \"Ultimately, the important things are companionship, love, a capacity for forgiveness,\" she says. \"Not the stuff that may impress outsiders.\" You want to spend all your time with your partner. And you constantly worry about your relationship, even when you've been together for years. Schwartz says this kind of partner can be overbearing or have highs and lows that drive her significant other crazy. Keep it healthy: Don't crowd your lover, Schwartz says. \"Realize that too much of a good thing can be too much.\" You may need to talk to a counselor who can help you understand why you feel so insecure and help you find ways to put your relationship in perspective. Health.com: 28 days to a healthier relationship You may give more than you get. \"At some point, you find that it's all going one way,\" Schwartz says. You're constantly working selflessly to meet your partner's needs, but you're not looking after you. Keep it healthy: It's important to have a life outside of your marriage. Develop your own interests, cultivate your own friendships, and reserve time to do things you like to do -- without your partner. You love courtship. \"For these lovers, the chase is a lot of it,\" Schwartz says. You're easily bored in long-term relationships, though, and your eye may roam. Keep it healthy: First, avoid situations that could lead to affairs. \"Don't have a drink with that interesting colleague,\" Schwartz says. \"Take temptation out of your life.\" Instead of looking for excitement outside your relationship, try doing new things (salsa dancing, anyone?) with your partner, so you can see him in a fresh light. Health.com: 10 ways to shake up date night Love seems to creep up on you. One day you think, \"Wow, I've really been spending a lot of time with Jack,\" then realize you're in love. In the long term, your relationship may be quiet, but it's strong. Keep it healthy: Don't let your thing get too platonic. \"You need moments of romance,\" Schwartz says. Planning a special dinner for two or just planting a passionate kiss on him once in a while shows your partner (and reminds you, too) that you think he's sexy and exciting.",

        "article": "AUMUHLE, West Germany, Jan. 6\u2014 The funeral wreaths lay piled in the snow, and around them stood the men of Germany's past, shaking hands, introducing wives, and turning the funeral of Adolf Hitler's successor into a final grasp at justifying their part of history. ''To our Reich's President,'' the gold letters on the black and white ribbon of one of the wreaths said. ''Alles fur Deutschland,'' ''Grand Admiral Karl Doenitz, in honor and fidelity - the survivors of U-Boat 309,'' ''Courage to the end,'' read some of the other inscriptions, the old phrases and the Gothic script perfect symbols of the mood outside the red brick church at the edge of a forest 15 miles from Hamburg. About 2,500 people, some with Knight's Crosses tied with red and black ribbons around their necks, many in the cashmere overcoats of postwar West German prosperity, came to the church for the burial of Karl Doenitz, the Grand Admiral who administered the German Reich for 23 days in 1945 until the unconditional surrender that ended World War II in Europe. Convicted by the Nuremberg tribunal of war crimes and crimes against peace, Admiral Doenitz served a 10-year sentence, and then lived out his life in this handsome suburban village until his death at 89 on Christmas Eve. Although the West German Government paid Admiral Doenitz the pension due his rank, and technically maintained his name on the list of retired officers in spite of his Nuremberg conviction, the Defense Ministry refused to send a representative to the funeral and forbade members of the armed forces to attend in uniform. Old Soldiers Are Angered This infuriated the men from the old soldiers' leagues and rightwing organizations who stood in knots in the snow outside the church, berating West German television reporters, telling them they did not dare to broadcast ''the truth about the Grand Admiral and the shameregime in Bonn,'' and then refusing to give their names to go with their statements. Controversy had grown up around the funeral in the past few days after a number of British newspapers published commentaries in which the former admiral was portrayed essentially as a remarkable submarine commander rather than a blind toady of Hitler. ''He did his duty, what any decent soldier would do,'' a man wearing the naval-type cap of a veterans organization shouted before the service began. A friend with a scarf in the red, black and white colors of the Imperial Navy around his neck raised his voice even louder. ''He was sentenced by a criminal Allied tribunal that broke every international standard to send him to jail! He was a hero of the German people!'' By contradiction, Admiral Doenitz was described last week by Robert M.W. Kempner, the deputy United States counsel at the Nuremberg trials, as a loyal assistant to Hitler. West German historians have described the admiral as rigid and remorseless, and there was testimony at the war crimes hearings that he advocated the killing of captured Allied merchant seamen. ''The German people,'' Admiral Doenitz said in 1944, ''have the Fuhrer to thank for everything, absolutely everything. If we hadn't been given the Fuhrer, there would be no people left in Germany.'' In military terms, of the 863 submarines under Admiral Doenitz's command, 756 were lost. Of the approximately 36,000 U-boat crew members, close to 28,000 were killed. But over the years Admiral Doenitz's hindsight remained similar to that of the men who attended his funeral: Alfred Speer, Hitler's Minister for War Production, who spent time with the admiral in Spandau Prison, insisted Admiral Doenitz told him that if he had another chance, he would have done it all again, exactly the same way. 4 Eulogies for Admiral There were four eulogies for the admiral, whose coffin, draped with the red, black and yellow flag of West Germany, was carried by 10 men wearing Knight's Crosses. During the ceremony, Admiral Doenitz's dagger was placed on the coffin, before which stood an attendant holding a pillow bearing the admiral's decorations. Admiral Doenitz was praised by Edward Wegener, a retired rear admiral, for his ''unshakable fidelity to the leadership of the state'' and as a man favorable to reform and new ideas. He also expressed an occasional, curious distance from the admiral at some points, suggesting that although Admiral Doenitz was not a member of the Nazi party, he was ''woven into the guilt of its leadership'' and that questions had to be asked today about whether obedience alone was sufficient justification for soldiers' actions. But this was only a slight, fleeting modulation in tone. The Bonn Government, Mr. Wegener said, acted shamefully in trying to disassociate itself from the admiral, and the crowd outside the church, as if at a political rally, hooted with him in derision. When another speaker, Horst Niemack, a retired major general, insisted that Admiral Doenitz's Nuremberg sentence was a political rather than a judicial decision, the crowd cheered. ''Ja, ja, so it was,'' came the voices. When the service ended, the crowd trying to pay respects at the bier was so great that the village pastor, the Rev. Hans Joachim Arp, had to ask them not to continue. The men in their 50's and 60's then turned to the churchyard, a few hundred yards away, where the admiral's grave had been dug. They walked to its edge, patted the backs of old friends, and sang bits of the national hymn, known outside Germany as ''Deutschland Uber Alles.'' A few young people, including a West German army officer in uniform, were mixed in with the faces from the past. In Bonn, a Defense Ministry spokesman, learning that a soldier had defied the nonattendance order, said that theoretically he could be expelled from the armed forces or suffer loss in rank as a result of his disobedience. The spokesman added that he expected neither to happen. Illustrations: Photo of the grave of Karl Doenitz",

        "article": "This post is in partnership with Entrepreneur. The article below was originally published at Entrepreneur.com. After months and months of depressing earnings reports, one question must be on every McDonald\u2019s MCD exec\u2019s mind: How on earth can we turn things around? Same-store sales fell 2.2 percent globally and 4.6 percent in the U.S. in November, McDonald\u2019s reported on Monday. The chain hasn\u2019t seen any growth sales in the U.S. for over a year. How can the fast-food chain pull itself out of the rapidly deepening rut? Here are four possible ways to turn things around. Go fast-casual. As the fast-casual business increasingly cuts into the market for fast food, it may be time for McDonald\u2019s to try and ditch its cheap but low-quality reputation. It seems the chain may be heading that way. \u201cToday\u2019s consumers increasingly demand more choice, convenience and value in their dining-out experience,\u201d McDonald\u2019s CEO Don Thompson said in a statement. At least some McDonald\u2019s locations are focusing on boosting the choice aspect, with a customizable menu that offers more options \u2013 and pricier burgers. McDonald\u2019s \u201cCreate Your Taste\u201d test platform is now expanding from four California stores to 30 locations in five more states, reports USA Today. By 2015, 2,000 U.S. locations will offer the menu platform, which allows customers to order more high-end burgers with toppings like eggs, smoked bacon and grilled mushrooms via tablet-like kiosks. The higher-quality burgers cost substantially more, with a customer burger with a drink and fries coming in at around $8.29, according to USA Today. The option is additionally expanding nationally in Australia, where the platform has also been widely tested. Incidentally, Australia was the only bright spot in McDonald\u2019s Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa (APMEA) same-store sales, which dropped 4 percent despite Australia\u2019s positive performance. Serve more chicken. With the expansion of the \u201cCreate Your Taste\u201d platform, McDonald\u2019s is adding a second meat to the menu: Chicken. Now customers will be able to build their own chicken sandwiches at the kiosks. Chicken was the surprise MVP of the quick service industry in 2014, with chicken chains like Chick-fil-A and Bojangles thriving and restaurants across the industry adding more chicken to the menu. Servings of breaded chicken sandwiches have grown an average of 3 percent over the last four years. Chicken is seen as a healthier option than burgers, whether or not the sandwiches actually have a higher calorie count, helping the trendy fowl to fit in with the fast-casual trend. Additionally, with increased beef and pork prices, chicken is an economically sound options for restaurants interested in expanding their menu. Maybe it\u2019s time for the biggest burger chain in the world to downplay the hamburger and focus on chicken instead. Simplify the menu. While the \u201cCreate Your Taste\u201d menu sounds awesome in theory, it seems to run counter one of McDonald\u2019s plans: simplifying the overstuffed menu. McDonald\u2019s maintains that to restore momentum in the U.S., it is \u201cdiligently working\u201d to simplify the menu. However, in an October survey, the vast majority of franchisees stated that McDonald\u2019s had failed so far to fulfill its promise to streamline the menu, something that has been on the company\u2019s to-do list for about a year. Regain China\u2019s trust. McDonald\u2019s U.S. same-store sales slump is disturbing for the chain in large part because there is no one problem the brand can focus on. At least in Asia, McDonald\u2019s knows what the issue is. The scandal surrounding a McDonald\u2019s supplier selling expired meat has continued to damage McDonald\u2019s performance in Japan and China. Currently, the chain hopes to fix the problem by leveraging menu options and deals, but ultimately the only fix is to wait it out. Yum Brands, who was also affected by the meat supplier scandal, estimated in October that recovery in the region would take at least six to nine months. So, internationally at least, it\u2019s a waiting game for McDonald\u2019s. With New Roastery, Starbucks Wants to be the \u2018Willy Wonka of Coffee\u2019 Pizza + Doritos? Pizza Hut Says Yes.

        "article": "Ann Johansson for The New York Times A gymnasium has been converted to house inmates at the California Institution for Men in Chino. Inmates on Tuesday watched soap operas on television. CHINO, Calif. \u2014 The basketball hoops jimmied up to the ceiling prove that this dingy space was a gym once upon a time. But for years now, the windowless space has served as a de facto cell for dozens of prisoners at the California Institution for Men. The rows of bunk beds, just a few inches apart, covered almost every empty space on the floor Tuesday afternoon. The gap between most beds allowed only the thinnest of inmates to stand comfortably. A few prisoners wandered around, but most simply rested on their thin mattresses, reading or dozing. As a rule, they go out to the yard just two or three times a week. Ominous messages stenciled on the walls signaled the tension: \u201cCaution: No warning shots will be fired.\u201d Two guards mind the 200 prisoners, while another, known as a gunner, watches from up high, ready to intervene at any moment. It would be hard to call the cavernous cell anything but crowded. Still, there are fewer people in it than there were just a few months ago, when triple bunk beds lined the wall. Now, those have been converted to hold just two inmates. \u201cThat helped,\u201d said Michael Collins, a 49-year-old inmate who sits a few feet from a dank corner converted into a group of metal toilets and open shower stalls. \u201cWe have less people using the bathroom now. If you just mind your business and stay in your bed, it\u2019s O.K.\u201d But according to a Supreme Court ruling issued Monday, California \u2014 which has the highest overcrowding rate of any prison system in the country \u2014 must eliminate rooms like this at its facilities across the state, shedding some 30,000 prisoners over the next two years. The problem is not new. For decades, the prison population has steadily risen, largely because of tougher mandatory sentencing laws. The overcrowding has led to riots, suicides and killings of inmates and guards over the last several years. Matthew Cate, the secretary of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, said conditions had actually improved since the filing of the lawsuit in 2006 that ended with Monday\u2019s court decision. There are now roughly 143,000 inmates in the state\u2019s prisons, down from 162,000 in 2006, in part because the state has sent some 10,000 inmates to out-of-state facilities. While there were once nearly 20,000 inmates in spaces not meant for housing, commonly referred to as \u201cbad beds,\u201d that number has dropped to 6,600. \u201cIt\u2019s not perfect, but we haven\u2019t been at those kinds of levels since the early 1990s,\u201d Mr. Cate said. \u201cThe standard that I use personally is: are the prisons clean, are the staff positions filled and are prisoners complaining about care? I think that conditions are good on a day-to-day basis on the basics.\u201d But critics say that it is impossible for the state to deal with such a glutted system. The lack of space can make it impossible, for example, to move inmates from one prison to another for their own safety. Mr. Cate said that the state was \u201cthe birthplace for every major prison gang in the country,\u201d but that the overcrowding paralyzes wardens from switching prisoners to defuse racial and gang tensions. \u201cIt\u2019s an unacceptable working environment for everyone,\u201d said Jeanne Woodford, a former director of the state prisons and a former warden at San Quentin prison. \u201cEvery little space is filled with inmates and they are housed where they shouldn\u2019t be housed, and every bed is full. It leads to greater violence, more staff overtime and a total inability to deal with health care and mental illness issues.\u201d One major impact of the overcrowding, and a centerpiece of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, is the lack of adequate health care for prisoners with mental illness or other chronic medical conditions. In 2005, a federal official began overseeing California\u2019s prison health care system after a judge ruled that the state was giving substandard medical care for prisoners. Now, Mr. Cate said, roughly 90 percent of all clinical positions are filled, although that rate varies among the prisons. Donald Specter, the director of the Prison Law Office who argued against the state before the Supreme Court, said that medical care was still wanting.",

        "article": "JOHANNESBURG\u2014 AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. AU 1.18 % , the world\u2019s No. 3 gold producer, could pay a dividend in 2017 for the first time in four years, reflecting a sustained recovery in gold prices and falling costs that helped it swing back to a first-half profit. The South African mining company will reassess whether to reinstate the dividend at the end of this year, with shareholders potentially getting a cash payout in 2017, Chief Executive Srinivasan Venkatakrishnan said Monday. The company last paid a dividend in 2013. \u201cThe key here is not to be carried away by the volatility in the gold price,\u201d Mr. Venkatakrishnan said. The possibility of dividend payments resuming is the latest sign of a turnaround for the gold company and the gold-mining industry at large, which has been beaten down by years of weak gold prices. The company received an average gold price of $1,222 an ounce in the first half, up 1.5% from $1,204 in the same period a year earlier. Gold prices are still down about 30% from 2011 highs of above $1,900 an ounce. AngloGold reported a profit of $52 million for the six months to the end of June\u2014compared with a loss of $23 million during the first six months of 2015\u2014despite a 7.1% slide in gold production from the same period a year earlier. Higher gold prices, favorable exchange rates, and cost reductions\u2014AngloGold has cut overhead by more than half since the end of 2012\u2014contributed to the turnaround. With cash flow rebounding, the company reduced net debt by nearly one-third, to $2.1 billion at June 30. It has maintained its full-year production guidance of between 3.6 million to 3.8 million ounces. Investors have anticipated AngloGold\u2019s improving performance, with the stock price more than doubling so far this year on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange JSE 1.10 % alongside the 27% rebound in gold prices to nearly $1,350 an ounce. Company shares on the JSE were down 5% at 283.44 rand ($21.03) on Monday. Mr. Venkatakrishnan said the company remains committed to lowering costs and improving margins as emerging-market currencies, which have provided cost benefits in the first six months of the year, begin to strengthen. Management has revised its outlook on the South African rand and Brazilian real, Mr. Venkatakrishnan said. \u201cAny strengthening of the exchange rate will obviously push up our unit dollar cost,\u201d he said. But stronger emerging-market currencies also mean a weaker dollar. That, in turn, means the price of gold\u2014which is then cheaper for foreign buyers\u2014should also rise, mitigating the effects of the stronger currencies on the miner\u2019s performance, he said. AngloGold said first-half headline earnings, which strip out certain exceptional and one-time items, were 23 cents a share, a turnaround from a loss of 31 cents a share a year earlier, and in line with the company\u2019s previously announced guidance. Revenue fell 4% to $2.04 billion. All-in sustaining costs dropped 1.4% to $911 an ounce. At the company\u2019s Obuasi gold mine in Ghana, an incursion of illegal miners continues to operate at the site, despite \u201cextensive engagements\u201d with local authorities. \u201cThe progress is frustratingly slow,\u201d Mr. Venkatakrishnan said.

        "article": "Ever since Star Wars first hit the screens back in 1977, countless people have dreamed of getting the chance to roam Tatooine\u2019s sand-swept plains for themselves. And for the last few months, tens of thousands of fans have done exactly that in a secret location in east London. As part of the latest installment of Secret Cinema, the immersive film-screening company that\u2019s steadily gained popularity in London since its 2007, audiences are dressing up in their intergalactic finest and visiting a top-secret location that\u2019s been transformed into a Star Wars inspired world, complete with sand, bustling cantinas, Jawas trading seeds and stormtroopers stomping around. (The production, which began in June, runs until Sept. 27.) Though the Jawas and stormtroopers are actors, hired to enhance the experience, it can be hard to spot anyone not dressed in Galactic rebel-inspired costumes. The event\u2019s centrepiece may be a screening of The Empire Strikes Back, but it\u2019s the immersive setting, where everyone looks and acts like a character in the film, that\u2019s the real draw. Secret Cinema \u201cwas based around this idea of What if you could be inside a movie?\u201d the company\u2019s founder Fabien Riggall tells TIME. \u201cI wanted to create imaginary experiences where people just get catapulted into a world where they can be anything they want to be, they can talk to anyone they want to talk to and also become part of it.\u201d Instead of simply going to a cinema and quietly staring at a screen for two hours, Secret Cinemas is trying to transform watching a film into an full-on interactive adventure. That immersive experience falls in line with a host of other companies who are set on changing the way people experience culture. Because when it comes to immersive events, the audience doesn\u2019t just watch the story \u2014 they become part of the story. \u201cAll the world\u2019s a stage, And all the men and women merely players\u201d As You Like It, William Shakespeare The British theater company Punchdrunk is known for its provocative plays where audiences don masks and follow actors around as they recreate pantomime scenes in large buildings. Its production of Sleep No More, a loose spin on Macbeth, has been staged in London, New York and Boston. Felix Barrett, the creative director of the company, which was started in 2000, says he was inspired to experiment with the way audiences and actors interacted after becoming bored with much of modern theater. \u201cIt felt like it was switching off,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was closing you down. And surely good art should wake you up and your body should be ready to receive it.\u201d Immersive productions have caught on in the U.K. and different companies provide different experiences\u2014some more immersive than others. While productions held by Secret Cinemas and Punchdrunk tend to have set stories that the audience can join in on, the critically acclaimed British theater company You Me Bum Bum Train (often shortened to YMBBT), which was founded in 2004, allows its audience run the show. A performance involves volunteer actors in different settings but they take all their cues from the individuals attending based on how they react to the sets. Stateside theater companies have also been increasingly experimenting with immersive productions. Notably, Third Rail Projects is currently putting on Then She Fell (in Brooklyn until December), which is billed as an immersive play \u201ccombining a hospital ward, the writings of Lewis Carroll, and just 15 audience members per show.\u201d As the immersive theater experience has caught on, productions have also become more ambitious. Secret Cinema\u2019s Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back is its biggest show to date and the company is planning a production in Los Angeles. Punchdrunk\u2019s Barrett says his company also has big plans\u2014though details are currently under wraps\u2014with more productions planned in the U.S. While the idea of being thrown into the mix, without knowing what will happen, might seem stressful for more introverted audience members, immersive cultural experiences have been a big hit. Many events earn rave reviews from critics. What\u2019s more, tickets often sell out quickly, even without elaborate or sustained advertising campaigns. Word of mouth alone is often enough to intrigue audiences. As Secret Cinema\u2019s Riggall says of the productions, \u201cI think they\u2019ve opened up the audience to the unexpected.\u201d",

        "article": "GROUP PORTRAIT Joseph Conrad, Stephen Crane, Ford Madox Ford, Henry James and H.G. Wells. By Nicholas Delbanco. Illustrated. 224 pp. New York: William Morrow and Co. $11.50. ''GROUP PORTRAIT,'' by the novelist Nicholas Delbanco, is a critical rumination on the lives and work of five writers who lived near each other at the turn of the century: Henry James, Joseph Conrad, Stephen Crane, H.G. Wells and Ford Madox Ford. The portraitist's canvas isn't quite wide enough to encompass all five men at once, and so Mr. Delbanco, like any good artist, narrows the focus to one or two of his subjects at a time: a chapter on Crane first, then another on Conrad and Ford, followed by one on James and Wells. These three chapters are sandwiched between two others: an introductory one stating the theme and a finale, a fine, freefloating cadenza on writing and on writers that finds the author in the place that drew his confederates together -East Sussex and Kent, the coastal country from which the sea retreated in southeastern England. Though each of the five writers chose, for different reasons, to live in this particular setting at this particular time, because ''the world of literary London, its clubs and power brokers, looked at them askance or with the kind of tolerance that incorporates disdain,'' an aura of romantic exclusion set them apart. Even so, Mr. Delbanco's notion of what constitutes a community is exaggerated. The comparison to Bloomsbury seems far-fetched. Blood ties, marriages, sexual liaisons, class affinities, a similar turn of mind and even a printing press drew Bloomsbury's writers and artists together. A more accurate label would take its cue from Mr. Delbanco's illuminating phrase ''convivial solitude.'' This is a book about convivial solitaries living within walking distance of each other rather than a fellowship of shared viewpoints and loyalties. The story begins at an 1899 post-Christmas play presented at Brede House, Stephen and Cora Crane's rented manor in Kent. ''The Ghost'' was the product of many hands, including all of the Delbanco five save Ford. The play was neither memorable nor intended to be, but no English publisher would have turned it down without a qualm. Crane, famous as a war correspondent just back from the Spanish-American War, had survived gunfire and shipwreck; ''The Red Badge of Courage'' and ''Maggie'' were behind him. Wells was soon to be almost as popular a writer as Kipling, and Conrad and James were distinguished novelists with discerning followings and considerable power in the literary world. James, already known as ''The Master,'' was launching his ''major phase''; Conrad was working on ''Lord Jim'' and ''Heart of Darkness.'' Ford, 28 at the time, had rented his Pent Farm to Conrad, who could count among his fervent admirers the four other writers of Mr. Delbanco's neighborly quintet. The same could not be said of a single other writer among them. Brede House was a cold, wet, unmanageable pile with a 100-acre park, where Crane played the squire to the hilt. According to Wells, ''the sanitary equipment of Brede House dated from the seventeenth century,'' no help to a man coughing himself to death while entertaining a stream of visitors. In Ford's view, Brede House was the place where ''Grub Street and Greenwich Village (met).'' The Cranes were not married but lived as if they were, and only an understanding between them, psychological calculation on Cora's part or a misreading of the grim facts could account for their exuberant extravagance in the face of Crane's mortal illness. Cora had the tastes of a courtesan; living on credit down to the matchsticks, she ordered the place redecorated. The Cranes were kind and sweet, loved each other, from all accounts, and in spite of Cora's past - she had been a hostess in a Florida club - radiated the kind of innocence James was celebrating in Americans living abroad. He was, after all, one of them. In spite of Crane's camaraderie and generosity, a doom-eager quality about him suggested more than the final symptoms of tuberculosis. Mr. Delbanco places Crane in a framework: ''Poe preceded him, Hemingway would follow.'' The Cranes ignored the doctor and the bailiff at great cost; the day after the triumph of ''The Ghost,'' Crane had a hemorrhage. He died a few months later, in 1900. He was soon to be followed by Queen Victoria, in January 1901. The Edwardian Age was ushered in with just as sharp a reshifting of values as would take place a decade later. When Virginia Woolf facetiously but accurately said, ''On or about December, 1910, human character changed,'' she could as easily have been speaking of the British world of 1900. Exhilaration and foreboding were in the air - as were the plane, the phone and the radio. The Dreyfus case had sounded its warning; the Spanish-American War marked the emergence of American imperial power. Freer sexual behavior, a defiance of convention -ideas no more original than these simmered behind visible changes in dress, manner and architecture.",

        "article": "Sales of over-the-counter cold remedies for children have fallen sharply since a federal panel concluded they should not be used for children younger than 6 because of a dearth of evidence that they work and concerns they can be dangerous. Even though the winter cold season has begun, sales of the products, which have been rising steadily for years, dropped more than 16 percent in the four weeks that ended Nov. 3, compared both with the previous four-week period and with the same period last year, according to the first estimates since the panel's Oct. 19 pronouncement. \"Historically, sales of these products are on an upswing at this time of year,\" said Jennifer C. Frighetto of ACNielsen, a market research firm that tracks the sales. \"Based on the historical sales, one would have expected to see an increase, not a decrease.\" Americans spent $21.1 million on the medications during the four weeks, the most recent period for which data is available, down from a little more than $25.3 million during the previous four weeks, the firm reported. \"This is good news,\" said Baltimore Health Commissioner Joshua M. Sharfstein, who is leading the drive to get the Food and Drug Administration to restrict use of the products. \"This is a plus for child health. Fewer parents are giving unproven and potentially unsafe drugs to their children.\" The pharmaceutical industry, however, maintains that the remedies are safe and effective, and said it is too soon to attribute the drop to the recent criticisms of them. \"It's premature to make the connection that a drop in sales is directly the result,\" said Elizabeth A. Funderburk of the Consumer Healthcare Products Association. \"It's not surprising at this point to see that drop, given that it's been a mild cold season so far this year.\" Several pediatricians disagreed, saying they had seen many parents in recent weeks who said they had stopped giving the medications to their children since hearing about the warnings. \"It really frightened a lot of parents,\" said Joanna Sexter of Spring Valley Pediatrics in the District. \"Sometimes these stories come out, and parents challenge it and pooh-pooh it. This time, that didn't happen. I've had a lot of parents say they just threw it all away.\" That was the case for Laura R. Moorer, a law librarian from Rockville. Even though she thinks the remedies have helped her 2 1/2 -year-old daughter, Katie, in the past, Moorer and her husband decided not to use any when she was hit by a bad cold several weeks ago. \"We kept her home from preschool and watched her spend several days in misery, and I felt bad we could not do something to alleviate the coughing and discomfort she was feeling,\" Moorer said. \"But I was also concerned enough not to let her use the medication. So we went back to home remedies: elevated pillow, humidifier, steamy shower, not much milk, clear fluids and extra TLC.\" Moorer said all of her friends have also sworn off the products, but some parents have not.",

        "article": "BERLIN \u2014 There\u2019s a refugee camp in the center of the German capital filled with people who have fled conflicts around the world. They sleep in tents and eat donated food. Almost all of them are breaking German law just by being here. For more than four months, about 50 asylum seekers and their supporters have been braving the elements on a square in Berlin\u2019s bohemian Kreuzberg neighborhood. The Occupy-style camp appeared in October after a group of refugees marched from Bavaria to Berlin to protest Germany\u2019s restrictive asylum law. Some even held a hunger strike at the Brandenburg Gate. Their main demand: the abolition of the so-called \u201cResidenzpflicht,\u201d or residence requirement, which limits asylum seekers\u2019 freedom of movement while their applications are pending. Critics contend [pdf] that Germany is the only country in the European Union with such a restriction, and that the regulation\u2019s real purpose is to isolate and intimidate refugees. When I visited the camp on Monday, laundry hung over unmade beds and worn couches inside one of the tents. Two gas heaters gasped against the cold seeping up through the pallets that raised the floor from the ground. A photographer\u2019s lamp provided the only light. This is where Waleed Mohamed Adam lives. The soft-spoken 28-year-old said he had fled his home in Darfur in 2007, reaching Europe via Libya. He has lost all contact with his family. And he has no documents. As Adam put it, \u201cMy fingerprints are in the Netherlands.\u201d Because his asylum application there was denied, he can\u2019t get a second hearing in Germany and faces deportation. Here in the camp, Adam is relatively safe because the local district mayor has said he would tolerate it until the spring. But every time Adam ventures outside the camp to seek treatment for his kidney condition, he risks being stopped and questioned by the police. Without any legal status, the refugees aren\u2019t treated much better than criminals. They find themselves in a trap: Dependent on meager state handouts because they are restricted from working or studying, they are under constant suspicion of milking the social welfare system. This contemptuous treatment was confirmed by Germany\u2019s Constitutional Court in July, when it ruled that the $300 monthly allowance for refugees \u2014 which hadn\u2019t been adjusted in 19 years \u2014 must be raised to the minimum social benefits granted to Germans, about $500. Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s center-right government is resisting any more concessions. Last year the Interior Ministry registered almost 65,000 asylum applications, up by 41 percent from 2011. A little more than 1 percent of applicants were granted asylum; 13 percent obtained refugee status. The number of applicants swelled largely because of claims by Roma from the former Yugoslavia, practically all of whom were turned down. Every rich, democratic country is a magnet for people fleeing war or repression. Yet human rights activists are right to assail the E.U. for removing internal borders while building a Fortress Europe to the rest of the world. Of the 40 million people uprooted from their homes worldwide, two-thirds are \u201cinternally displaced\u201d within the borders of their own countries, according to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. The other third, who flee abroad, usually burden neighboring countries. Only a stream of refugees ever crosses into the E.U., and just a trickle reaches Germany. Hundreds die along the way. Germany\u2019s harsh asylum law reveals its lingering discomfort with \u201causl\u00e4nder,\u201d or foreigners \u2014 even as an aging, shrinking indigenous population is projected to lose its standard of living unless it welcomes immigrants. In my years living in Germany, I made two friends \u2014 one from Vietnam, another from Russia \u2014 as they struggled through the tortuous asylum process. Today they\u2019re both German citizens with well-integrated and successful families. I hope the same for the refugees I met this week. The only woman in the camp, Napuli Paul Langa is a born leader. Although she had to break off her schooling in her native South Sudan, she speaks fluent English. She said she had to flee because of her human rights activism. She didn\u2019t expect to have to carry on that struggle in Germany. In November, Langa was one of the refugees\u2019 delegates at a meeting with members of Parliament that turned out to be fruitless. \u201cThis is the fighting place, the political place,\u201d she said of the camp. \u201cWe\u2019re staying here. We\u2019re going to protest in the streets until they meet our demands.\u201d Lucian Kim is a journalist based in Berlin. He blogs at luciankim.com",

        "article": "Being happy in your job is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it's great for obvious reasons. On the other, it's puts you in a tricky spot when it comes to salary negotiation. That's according to Lee E. Miller, co-author of \"A Woman's Guide to Successful Negotiating\" with his daughter Jessica Miller. He says discounting the possibility that you could change jobs puts you at a disadvantage \u2014 and women are more likely than men to make this misstep. \"The minute a woman makes it clear she can't or won't leave because of family or because she likes the job, she reduces her effectiveness,\" Miller told Business Insider. \"If you approach a boss making it clear you're not going to leave, why should [they] pay you more?\" \"It's always about what you're worth in the market based on skills and experience,\" he continued. \"Either your current employer will give it to you, or you need to go out in the market.\" Men, he says, are more likely to embrace this tactic, meaning they tend to change jobs more often and get the bump in pay that comes along with it. And for the record, he says, if you go out and can't get more, you're probably earning what you're worth.

A more effective tactic is asking your employer to help you stay in a position you love. Miller broke down the difference: \"I've got another offer. If you don't give me a raise, I'm going to leave.\" \"That could work,\" said Miller, \"but the boss isn't going to like it.\" \"I really love it here, but I've got this other offer, and it's a lot more money. Is there anything you can do to help me get to the market rate? I don't want to take this offer, but it's made it clear I'm being compensated way below market. Can you help me?\" \"When you ask for help in getting up to market rates, it engenders a very different response,\" Miller said. \"It's not about threatening to leave, but about making sure your employer knows you're happy there ... but other people are calling.\" But, he emphasized, don't lie about having another offer. If you don't have one, you can go out and get one, but make sure you're approaching your employer with the truth.

        "article": "Iraq\u2019s politicians are known for settling disputes violently, injecting ancient grievances into modern-day disputes, bickering endlessly and putting off tough choices. They are not known for reaching consensus. That makes the widespread support for Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi\u2019s plan to overhaul the country\u2019s government extraordinary and somewhat bewildering. After weeks of street protests, and a nod from Iraq\u2019s supreme Shiite religious leader, Mr. Abadi announced over the weekend that he would slash layers of the bloated central government, eliminating several posts that have historically been assigned by quota to Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds in an effort to have an inclusive government. The plan, which the Iraqi Parliament approved unanimously on Tuesday, is part of a wide-ranging effort to cut government spending, curb corruption and improve the country\u2019s dilapidated infrastructure. Mr. Abadi seems to recognize that carrying it out will be extremely hard. On Tuesday, he said he was committed to pushing the reforms through \u201ceven if it costs me my life.\u201d Securing the backing, at least in principle, of virtually every constituency in the disjointed political system is a good start. But the challenge of political reform is daunting with large parts of the country under the control of the Islamic State, a terrorist organization, and the tumbling price of oil battering Iraq\u2019s economy. For the plan to succeed, Mr. Abadi, a Shiite, must ensure that the overhaul does not deepen the disenfranchisement of the Sunni minority. Two of the politicians who stand to lose their jobs, Vice President Osama al-Nujaifi and Saleh al-Mutlaq, a deputy prime minister, are among the most influential Sunnis in Baghdad. Eliminating layers in a government that has been run like a collection of fiefs is certain to anger those who have benefited from the patronage system and ceremonial posts. To counter that, Mr. Abadi will have to reach out to Sunni leaders from violence-plagued provinces west and north of the capital and give them a meaningful say in governance. The government\u2019s failure to address the grievances of Sunnis \u2014 which include joblessness, abuses by Shiite-led security forces and unjustified imprisonment \u2014 set the conditions for the Islamic State, a Sunni group, to take control of Mosul, Iraq\u2019s second-largest city, last summer. It also controls key parts of western Anbar Province. A wild card in the Abadi plan is former Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, who became a vice president when he was forced to cede power last year and now stands to lose his post. Mr. Maliki, a Shiite, expressed support for the plan, perhaps because it would have been untenable to criticize a move endorsed by Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, the most revered religious figure in Iraq. Mr. Maliki, a deeply sectarian politician, has remained a corrosive figure even in his diminished role. It is hard to believe that he intends to fade away quietly. Indeed, many Iraqis assume he\u2019s plotting a comeback. To make that dreadful scenario less likely, Mr. Abadi must find ways to build cooperation in a country that has seen little of it.

        "article": "updated 1:42 PM EDT, Tue July 22, 2014 Editor's note: Sally Kohn is a progressive activist, columnist and television commentator. Follow her on Twitter @sallykohn. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. (CNN) -- In the wake of the important decision by the Environmental Protection Agency to block mining in Alaska's Bristol Bay in order to protect the wild salmon population there, it's a good moment to take stock of the many dangers facing our world's waterways -- and our world's fish. It turns out the wild salmon of Bristol Bay are one of the five least toxic fish to eat around the globe and thankfully will stay that way, thanks to the Obama administration. But what are the other four? And why are the world's fish and water under such threat? A range of abuses of the environment flow into each other in our world's oceans and lakes and rivers. There's marine pollution in which garbage is intentionally disposed of or carelessly dropped into our waters to such an extent that, for instance, in the north Pacific, there is actually a giant swirling vortex of garbage estimated to be the size of Texas. Then there's climate change. Our world's oceans have already absorbed 80% of the additional global heat that has been added to our climate system and absorbed 33% of the carbon dioxide humans have emitted into the atmosphere. Add to that over-fishing. With the world's fish supplies already cut down by environmental hazards, mass fishing technologies like bigger boats and bigger nets have cut the fish population even further, which in turn limits reproduction and natural repopulation. A stunning three-quarters of the world's fish supply is being harvested faster than the fish can reproduce. And 80% of the world's fish have already been fully exploited or are facing perilous decline. And then the fish that survive are sick. Water runoff dumps poisons like industrial PCBs, heavy metals, including mercury and lead, agricultural pesticides and sewage system effluents directly into our water. Fish eat or absorb that poison and when you eat the fish, those toxins are passed onto you, often at dangerous levels. So what's an omnivore to do? Fortunately, there are good fish -- fish that are healthy to eat and responsibly caught in ways that are good for the health of other fish and our oceans. According to SeafoodWatch.org, a helpful resource on these issues, healthy fish must have low levels of mercury and provide high levels of Omega-3s (the good oils our bodies can and should be getting from eating fish). Plus healthy fish are caught or farmed responsibly, which prevents endangered fish populations -- yes there are many -- and ensures that dolphins or other sea creatures aren't harmed by fishing nets. So what are the best fish to eat? According to SeafoodWatch, in addition to Alaska's wild caught salmon (the salmon now thankfully preserved in Bristol Bay and beyond), you want to go with canned wild Alaska salmon, Atlantic mackerel and freshwater Coho salmon. Also... sardines, the subject of the video at the top of this story. Wild-caught Pacific sardines are plentiful and quick to reproduce and don't eat a lot of toxins during their short lives. And they can taste great, especially if you find larger filets and grill 'em up. Those are the best of the best. SeafoodWatch also counts as healthy choices sablefish/black cod from Alaska and the Canadian Pacific, and troll- or pole-caught albacore tuna from the United States or British Columbia. And if you can't get these, there are less sustainable and only sorta-toxic options in between, but it's best to avoid the \"dirtiest of the dirty\" fish, which include imported catfish and shrimp, bluefin tuna and Chilean sea bass. In general, stick with the fish on the healthy list, and you'll be doing your body and the planet a big favor. Responsible fish eating won't solve all our ocean and fish problems around the globe. We still have to stop polluting the oceans and address climate change, which is hurting our nation's water. But for starters, one thing you can do when you go out to eat or cook at home is pick fish that are good for you and good for the planet. It's a simple and delicious step in the right direction.

        "article": "BOSTON, May 21\u2014 Former President Gerald R. Ford, overwhelmingly condemned in 1974 for pardoning his predecessor, Richard M. Nixon, was honored today for that act by the John F. Kennedy Library with its Profile in Courage award. Caroline Kennedy, President Kennedy's daughter, presented a beaming Mr. Ford, 87, with a silver lantern emblematic of the award. She said Mr. Ford had proved that ''politics can be a noble profession'' with his ''controversial decision of conscience'' to issue the pardon. She said Mr. Ford's act was in the tradition honored by her father's 1956 book, ''Profiles in Courage.'' Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts told the audience at the John F. Kennedy Library: ''I was one of those who spoke out against his action then. But time has a way of clarifying past events, and now we see that President Ford was right. His courage and dedication to our country made it possible for us to begin the process of healing and put the tragedy of Watergate behind us.'' The 12-year-old award has been given to a Republican only once before -- last year, to Senator John McCain of Arizona. Past winners have been recognized for work on racial justice, the environment, poverty, peace in Northern Ireland and campaign finance legislation. Another award today, to Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia, fit that pattern. Ms. Kennedy recognized him for 40 years of ''steadfast devotion to the dream of an integrated society.'' The awards to Mr. Ford and Mr. Lewis carry $25,000 stipends. Mr. Ford said the award came as a surprise. The idea of honoring him was also a surprise to some of the 11 members of the award committee, which includes two Kennedys, three former Kennedy aides and two Republicans. Senator Kennedy said in an interview that he had awakened to the idea after reading an entry in an essay contest on political courage, an essay on Mr. Ford written by a high school student, Matthew Minor of Port Henry, N.Y. Senator Kennedy said that he had probably not thought about the Nixon pardon in 25 years but that he now saw it differently because of the ''whole impeachment furor'' over President Bill Clinton, which, he said, absorbed government institutions and ''drove from political debate all national and international concerns.'' Mr. Ford's only reference today to the pardon itself -- which contributed to his loss in the 1976 presidential election -- was to say that historians would argue about it forever, though he said the awards committee had ''displayed its own kind of courage.'' Mr. Ford said: ''President Kennedy understood that courage is not something to be gauged in a poll or located in a focus group. No adviser can spin it. No historian can backdate it. For, in the age-old contest between popularity and principle, only those willing to lose for their convictions are deserving of posterity's approval.'' In accepting his award, Mr. Lewis recalled that 40 years ago to the day, after a beating at the Montgomery, Ala., bus station -- which was also suffered by John Seigenthaler, then an aide to Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and now chairman of the awards committee -- he and other demonstrators were huddled in a church, besieged by a mob. He said the demonstrators knew that ''if we continued the Freedom Rides, we would face arrest or worse. And if we stopped the rides, freedom would be denied.'' But he said he was comforted by the line from the 30th Psalm, ''Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.'' The next morning, he said, President Kennedy federalized the Alabama National Guard and sent marshals so the riders could go on to Jackson, Miss. Photo: In honoring former President Gerald R.

        "article": "In the brief, wild-spending days of her Nouvelle Society reign, Susan Kaposta Penn Gutfreund\u2014airline flight attendant turned socialite queen\u2014cultivated her taste for things French and fine. Night after night, on the arm of her husband, John Gutfreund, head of the mighty Salomon Brothers investment bank, she would sashay into soirees dressed in opulent Christian Lacroix gowns. She bought the rarest of French perfumes by the quart\u2014as if they were motor oil or milk\u2014and filled the salons and boudoirs of her homes in New York City and Paris with priceless French antiques. Indeed, gazing at the sumptuous beauty of a room full of 18th-century French furniture she\u2019d bought, Susan reportedly whispered to a friend, \u201dIf it was good enough for Marie Antoinette, it\u2019ll do for me.\u201d Pauvre Susan. How could she have known that before long she would come to share not only Marie Antoinette\u2019s furniture but, save for the guillotine, her fate. For almost a decade her husband, known throughout the world\u2019s financial districts as the King of Wall Street, ruled as a ruthless and near-infallible wizard. But on Friday, Aug. 16, snared in a still unfolding scandal of deceit and dishonor involving his company\u2019s illegal purchase of U.S. government securities, Gutfreund, 61, was forced to resign. The SEC is currently investigating his involvement in Salomon\u2019s bond fraud. \u201dRemember all the people they stepped on on their way up?\u201d says a disgruntled former neighbor, Robert Postel. \u201dThe Gutfreunds are going to hear from all of them on this trip down.\u201d The couple\u2019s clamber up high society\u2019s slippery slopes began in 1980 when John and Susan, both lonely divorces, met at a dinner party and married the following year. Gutfreund, the son of middle-class German immigrants, had recently been appointed CEO of Salomon, which he helped build into the world\u2019s most powerful bond trading house. He was wealthy, but more obsessed by hard work than by the perks his wealth could bring. Says one close friend: \u201dI don\u2019t think [John] had ever had a young and beautiful woman pay that much attention to him. She called him five times a day. She had suits custom-made for him. She bought him cologne and made him wear it. She gave him the youth he never had.\u201d Indeed, it bothered John not one bit that Susan, 45, spent his many millions with feverish dedication. Millions he had; she brought him joy. Even from those inured to the excesses of the \u201980s, her lavish dinners brought raves. \u201dSusan has the most exquisite and expensive taste,\u201d says Boaz Mazor, a keen social observer and escort to the likes of Ivana Trump. \u201dThe menus, the wines, the flowers were the most extravagant and wonderful.\u201d The guest lists, too, dazzled: Kissinger, Rockefeller, Mitterrand, Forbes. Openly adoring, John once said, \u201dI\u2019m grateful that my wife has helped me to expand my horizons.\u201d But if they delighted him, her extravagances made the blue bloods boil. It wasn\u2019t so much her conspicuous consumption that rankled (she spent a reported $15 million renovating their Fifth Avenue duplex and insisted on a limousine just to take her to aerobics class); it was her hubris. What most bothered the Ladies Who Lunch and delighted the gossip columnists was Susan\u2019s unabashed attempt to buy her way into their ranks. In 1987, for instance, she bought a stack of Marie Antoinette\u2019s letters for a reported $16,000 and gave them to her new friend the Baroness Liliane de Rothschild for Christmas. Embarrassed by its extravagance, the Baroness sent the gift back. Says one Paris socialite of the now diminished Susan: \u201dShe\u2019s not what she used to be.\u201d Nonsense, says Boaz Mazor: \u201dAnyone who speaks ill of her is just jealous.\u201d Regardless of their current embarrassment, the Gutfreunds are still wealthy beyond reason (John\u2019s personal investments are estimated at $50 million) and comfortably ensconced in a summer hideaway on Nantucket with their only child, John Peter, 5. And if the mail brings fewer of those gilt-edged invitations in the difficult days and months that lie ahead, their friends expect that John and Susan will show royal resilience. \u201dThey\u2019ll be fine,\u201d says Mazor. In fact, they\u2019ll be good as gold. This piece originally appeared in the September 9, 1991 issue of People.",

        "article": "Malcolm Turnbull \u2013 channelling his inner Tony Abbott \u2013 is claiming Labor\u2019s plans to wind back negative gearing and capital gains tax discounts will \u201csmash\u201d the value of everyone\u2019s house. The only problem for the prime minister who promised evidence-based policy making is that there\u2019s no evidence to support his claim. Even those who agree there might be some reduction in house prices, say the impacts would be one-off and small. And the property industry \u2013 which hates Labor\u2019s changes \u2013 has modelling that says removing negative gearing could actually push house prices up and that the exact impact is hard to know. Either way, no smashing. Except in the House of Representatives. Related: Ending negative gearing won't matter. The economic risk is already baked in \u201cThey want the price of your home to go down, that is their objective and if they win the election they will succeed in smashing home values ... vote Labor and be poorer. Vote Labor and see your house price go down,\u201d Turnbull said in a hyperbolic question time attack almost worthy of the $100 lamb roast. \u201cEvery single home owner in every single electorate represented in this House will be poorer if the Labor party is elected to government,\u201d he claimed. Labor says its policy would improve housing affordability over time, so presumably it believes its policy will cause house prices to be somewhat lower than they would have been without the change. It has released some analysis to back that contention, but no detailed quantification. So here we are, back in the throes of a full-voiced evidence-free \u201che said, she said\u201d fight. Feels like we\u2019ve never been away. Still, let\u2019s look at the evidence that does exist. The closest thing to a quantification comes in the Grattan Institute\u2019s submission to a Senate inquiry on tax deductions, which finds that limiting negative gearing could have a one-off impact on house prices of between 1% and 2%. Whether that translates into a slightly slower increase in prices than would otherwise have been the case or a small absolute price reduction depends on the property market in a particular area when the change comes in. Curiously, actual modelling conducted by the Housing Industry Association suggests that limiting negative gearing could actually cause house prices to go up. That contradicts both Turnbull\u2019s \u201chouse prices smashed\u201d argument and Labor\u2019s housing affordability claims. Housing would become \u201cmore expensive\u201d, the modelling report, by Independent Economics, said. \u201cUnder current policy settings, discounting residential negative gearing in isolation is a retrograde step for tax reform, in terms of both efficiency and equity. By adding to the existing high tax burden in the housing market, it would reduce Australian living standards. By reducing the supply of housing, it would erode housing affordability for both renters and owner-occupiers,\u201d it found. And the Property Council \u2013 which has already started a campaign against Labor\u2019s changes \u2013 said it didn\u2019t know what the impact would be. \u201cWe haven\u2019t made any claims about the impact of their policy on residential house prices ... We haven\u2019t undertaken any modelling on the impact of the opposition\u2019s proposed changes to negative gearing and capital gains tax on house prices \u2013 in fact, we would like to see the opposition\u2019s modelling,\u201d said the council\u2019s chief executive, Ken Morrison. An Acil-Allen Consulting report prepared for the council found it was very difficult to know the impact of winding back capital gains tax discounts and negative gearing but also suggested prices could rise. \u201cRemoving negative gearing or the CGT discount altogether for property will dampen investment, diminish rental supply and make it more likely that in the short to medium-term rents and property prices will increase,\u201d the report said. But it warned \u201cit is not sound analysis to simply consider the effects of taxation arrangements on house prices. The cost of housing is shaped by a range of factors influencing demand and supply and hence it is hard to analyse the housing market in isolation from other markets and without considering the local, national and international interconnections. Furthermore, the evidence in this report shows that quantifying the effects of negative gearing on housing prices is a difficult task that would require modelling of complex investors\u2019 capital movements and secondary behavioural impacts as well as their effects on the macroeconomy. \u201cWhile negative gearing arrangements are unlikely to singlehandedly change the fundamentals of housing demand and supply, they do influence investment decisions (including the decision to invest in housing and the rental prices charged for an investment property). Given the complex interaction of factors affecting supply and demand for housing, the outcomes of significant changes to negative gearing on the housing market are uncertain.\u201d Related: Scott Morrison's response to Labor's negative gearing plan is truly disturbing | Greg Jericho A report by the progressive McKell Institute, which Labor drew upon when developing its policy found it was \u201cunlikely that the changes to negative gearing proposed in this report would have a material effect on prices in the near term\u201d. \u201cOver time it is expected that these reforms would improve housing affordability. As other reports, including the Henry Review, have noted tax settings play a relatively minor role in the price of housing. Other factors such as market fundamentals, zoning and building regulations and interest rates have a more material impact on house prices than tax settings.\u201d Presumably, the parliamentary budget office also made some assumptions about the impact of the policy when it costed it for Labor, but Labor has not released those detailed costings. No evidence then, and certainly nothing to suggest our house prices are in for a smashing.",

From creators to curators, alt-weekly comics seem to be enjoying a current wave of appreciation, after declines in the alt-market. \u201cI think it\u2019s because of the current generation,\u201d Feiffer tells The Post\u2019s Comic Riffs today, from his New York-area home, near where, in his mid-80s, he still teaches comics classes. \u201cAs they look at it as a serious area of study, the appreciation of the form and of the history grows.\u201d Feiffer\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning work in the Voice, plus underground comix artists like Denis Kitchen and Kim Deitch, helped inspire a wave of cartoonists that arose in the late \u201970s and \u201980s \u2014 including Matt Groening, Lynda Barry and Charles Burns (\u201cBig Baby\u201d), who all graduated from making comics at Evergreen State in the Pacific Northwest to achieving national alt-weekly syndication. Bernard notes that this will be a rare chance to see \u201cLife in Hell\u201d originals by \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d creator Groening, as well as Barry\u2019s \u201cErnie Pook\u2019s Comeek\u201d originals. Also spotlighted will be art by such \u201990s-wave cartooning stars as Tom Tomorrow (\u201cThis Modern World\u201d), \u201cFun Home\u201d author Alison Bechdel (\u201cDykes to Watch Out For\u201d) and \u201cBuilding Stories\u201d author Chris Ware (\u201cJimmy Corrigan\u201d). [\u201cThrilled\u201d Alison Bechdel breaks yet more ground with MacArthur \u201cgenius\u201d grant] Featured, too, will be art by Doug Allen, Marc Bell, Mark Beyer, Ruben Bolling, Derf, Ellen Forney, Ben Katchor, Keith Knight, Michael Kupperman, Carol Lay, Tony Millionaire, Mark Newgarden, R. Sikoryak, Jen Sorensen, Mark Alan Stamaty, Karl Stevens and Shannon Wheeler. [Eisner-nominated Derf pays tribute to staunch alt-press \u201cchampion\u201d David Carr] \u201cAlt-Weekly Comics\u201d will be at the Society of Illustrators location (128 E. 63rd St.). The opening reception will be Friday, and the show will run through May 2.

        "article": "Back to Black on Maroon \u2026 Mark Rothko's painting has been restored and is on display again at Tate Modern. Photograph: Lefteris Pitarakis/AP It's a red letter day \u2013 or a black on maroon one anyway. Mark Rothko's Black on Maroon, vandalised at Tate Modern in 2012, has at last gone on view again. It was clearly a serious attack, for the restoration has been slow and difficult. Now everyone is happy. Rothko's family praise the Tate restorers for their dedicated work. One of the most powerful modern paintings in Britain has returned to the light. Hooray. But has the Tate thought at all about why the attack happened, and has it considered for a second \u2013 can it bring itself to ask \u2013 if the less than conventional atmosphere of Tate Modern as an art museum may encourage a lack of reverence for its art? After all, it's not long since some children were spotted using its Donald Judd as a climbing frame. Is that so surprising when Tate Modern is famous for presenting slides as art? All of which is of our time but it's not what Rothko himself considered serious art. When he gave a large proportion of his greatest series of paintings to the Tate it was because he was sickened by the idea of these great and worrying visionary masterpieces ending up in the place originally planned for them \u2013 a posh New York restaurant. For him, art was an intense thing. For Rothko, painting was a desperate affair. He sealed this sense of being locked in struggle with art's higher angels when he took his own life. One of the things he got depressed about was the rise of pop artists like Andy Warhol. What \u2013 seriously \u2013 would he make of Tate Modern? At the old Tate, the one that is now Tate Britain, his paintings had their own room until the end of the 1990s, as quiet as a chapel. You can still contemplate them mystically at Tate Modern, but never as purely. Like everything else they must fit into this museum's nervously unpredictable displays and banal \"juxtapositions\" of past and present. The mood of this museum is the antithesis of everything Rothko stood for. It's noisy, riotous, and pop-cultural. Teens in the toilets, art lovers crying in the corner. Interactive art was being stressed at the museum at the time the Rothko was attacked. Did the idiotic vandal, who claims to be an artist, somehow gain courage from that? The atmosphere and ethos of Tate Modern incite irreverence towards the art. Are museums really entitled to turn themselves into massive club venues? Or should they be places of silent reverence? What's so very wrong with the museum as a refuge of thought? There's a case for moving the Rothkos to a quieter place where these great paintings can be seen in a context that Rothko would have wanted and that his art deserves. Perhaps the National Gallery might have them on long-term loan \u2013 for he was thinking about Michelangelo when he painted them. Or perhaps Tate Modern should grow up, and accept that a museum's most important job is to preserve great art and create an atmosphere conducive to enjoying and understanding it. Which by definition is not a place where art vandals feel at home.",

        "article": "WASHINGTON \u2014 A star-studded lineup of comedians including Chris Rock, Dave Chappelle, George Lopez, Kathy Griffin and Arsenio Hall honored Eddie Murphy as an \"American icon.\" The Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts presented the comedian Sunday with the Mark Twain Prize, the nation's top prize for humor. At one point, Murphy offered a reminder of his willingness to do politically incorrect humor by offering some jokes about former Mark Twain award winner Bill Cosby \u2014 who was one of his \"heroes,\" but has been accused by various women of sexual misconduct. \"Bill has one of these,\" Murphy told the audience. \"Did you all make Bill give his back? Because I know there was a big outcry from people they were trying to get all of Bill\u2019s trophies back. \"You know you f--- up when they want you to give your trophies back.\" The evening's most emotional tribute came from \"Saturday Night Live\" alum Tracy Morgan, who received a standing ovation from the audience. He called Murphy his \"comedic hero.\" Morgan survived a serious car crash last year that left him in a coma. Morgan said Murphy was the first person to call him on the phone and make him laugh after the tragic accident that killed a passenger in the limo and seriously injured two others \"He's the reason I'm in comedy. He's the reason I have a job. He's the reason I have a career,\" Morgan said. Among the other SNL alumni who paid tribute to Murphy were Jay Pharoah, Kevin Nealon and Joe Piscopo. \"Some people are just blessed with talent, and with Eddie, it was just luck,\" Nealon ribbed. CHECK OUT OUR NEW APP: GET THE DAILY NEWS ON ANDROID OR IOS Nealon said Murphy saved SNL from slumping ratings in the 1980s, and he hoped he could also save the Kennedy Center from becoming the Trump Center. \"I can see the slot machines in the lobby,\" joked Nealon, who starred with Murphy in \"Daddy Day Care.\" Trevor Noah, who took over hosting \"The Daily Show\" in September, said he was introduced to the comedian after viewing of \"Coming to America.\" \"Eddie Murphy's influenced almost every single comedian\u2014 especially of my generation. He did everything brilliantly,\" Noah said, in an interview with The Associated Press. \"He showed me a benchmark to aim for. He made me realize that there was a level of excellence to try and attain, and I still think I'm working at that 'til this day.\" Murphy called the prize a \"tremendous honor,\" but asked the center to clear up any confusion over the prize for future recipients. \"Actually, it's an award, but they call it a prize,\" he said. \"Usually when there's a prize, there's money.\" In referring to Cosby, Murphy joked that you know you've messed up \"when they want you to give your trophy back.\" Murphy did an impersonation of Cosby refusing to give back his award. Cosby, who received the award in 2009, has been accused by more than two dozen women of sexual misconduct, including allegations by many that he drugged and raped them. The humor prize honors those who influence society in the tradition of Samuel Clemens, the writer and satirist known as Mark Twain. Past honorees include Jay Leno, Carol Burnett, Tina Fey, Whoopi Goldberg, Ellen DeGeneres, Will Ferrell and Richard Pryor. Murphy gained national attention when he joined the SNL cast in 1980 at the age of 19. He went on to become the most commercially successful African-American actor in film history and one of the industry's Top 5 box office performers overall, the Kennedy Center said. Murphy's films have been among Hollywood's highest-grossing comedies, including \"48 Hours,\" ''Trading Places,\" ''Dr. Dolittle\" and \"Coming to America.\" The tribute will be broadcast Nov. 23 on PBS.",

        "article": "As we wade through the towers of presents and the mountains of torn wrapping paper, and watch the children\u2019s shining, joyful faces and occasional meltdowns, we may find ourselves speculating\u2014in a detached, philosophical way\u2014about generosity and greed. That\u2019s how I cope, anyway. Are we born generous and then learn to be greedy? Or is it the other way round? Do immediate intuitive impulses or considered reflective thought lead to generosity? And how could we possibly tell? Recent psychological research has weighed in on the intuitive-impulses side. People seem to respond quickly and perhaps even innately to the good and bad behavior of others. Researchers like Kiley Hamlin at the University of British Columbia have shown that even babies prefer helpful people to harmful ones. And psychologists like Jonathan Haidt at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business have argued that even adult moral judgments are based on our immediate emotional reactions\u2014reflection just provides the after-the-fact rationalizations. But some new studies suggest it\u2019s more complicated. Jason Cowell and Jean Decety at the University of Chicago explored this question in the journal Current Biology. They used electroencephalography, or EEG, to monitor electrical activity in children\u2019s brains. Their study had two parts. In the first part, the researchers recorded the brain waves of 3-to-5-year-olds as they watched cartoons of one character either helping or hurting another. The children\u2019s brains reacted differently to the good and bad scenarios. But they did so in two different ways. One brain response, the EPN, was quick, another, the LPP, was in more frontal parts of the brain and was slower. In adults, the EPN is related to automatic, instinctive reactions while the LPP is connected to more purposeful, controlled and reflective thought. In the second part of the study, the experimenters gave the children a pile of 10 stickers and told them they could keep them all themselves or could give some of them to an anonymous child who would visit the lab later in the day. Some children were more generous than others. Then the researchers checked to see which patterns of brain activity predicted the children\u2019s generosity. They found that the EPN\u2014the quick, automatic, intuitive reaction\u2014didn\u2019t predict how generous the children were later on. But the slow, thoughtful LPP brain wave did. Children who showed more of the thoughtful brain activity when they saw the morally relevant cartoons also were more likely to share later on. Of course, brain patterns are complicated and hard to interpret. But this study at least suggests an interesting possibility. There are indeed quick and automatic responses to help and to harm, and those responses may play a role in our moral emotions. But more reflective, complex and thoughtful responses may play an even more important role in our actions, especially actions like deciding to share with a stranger. Perhaps this perspective can help to resolve some of the Christmas-time contradictions, too. We might wish that the Christmas spirit would descend on us and our children as simply and swiftly as the falling snow. But perhaps it\u2019s the very complexity of the season, that very human tangle of wanting and giving, joy and elegy, warmth and tension, that makes Christmas so powerful, and that leads even children to reflection, however gently. Scrooge tells us about both greed and generosity, Santa\u2019s lists reflect both justice and mercy, the Magi and the manger represent both abundance and poverty. And, somehow, at least in memory, Christmas generosity always outweighs the greed, the joys outlive the disappointments. Even an unbeliever like me who still deeply loves Christmas can join in the spirit of Scrooge\u2019s nephew Fred, \u201cThough it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket [or, I would add, an entirely uncomplicated intuition of happiness in my brain], I believe that Christmas has done me good, and will do me good, and, I say, God bless it!\u201d",

        "article": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Not even a full day after Uber launched its self-driving vehicles in San Francisco did California regulators tell the company to shut the service down. The California Department of Motor Vehicles threatened legal action Wednesday, telling the company that it must first obtain a special permit to test autonomous vehicles on the state\u2019s roadways. Uber launched the service Wednesday morning and acknowledged at the time that it might run afoul of state regulators. The company had declined to obtain a permit on the grounds that its cars require human monitoring and thus do not meet the state\u2019s definition of an autonomous vehicle, a spokeswoman said early Wednesday. The DMV disagreed. It called Uber\u2019s program illegal and demanded that the company cease operations until it received a permit that would require the company to prove it is financially responsible, has qualified drivers, and will report collisions and other safety information to state regulators. Get Talking Points in your inbox: An afternoon recap of the day\u2019s most important business news, delivered weekdays. \u2018\u2018These requirements serve to build public trust in the safety of the technology and to foster confidence in allowing autonomous vehicles on public streets,\u2019\u2019 Brian Soublet, the department\u2019s deputy director and chief counsel, wrote in a letter. A spokewoman for the company did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the letter. Uber had said earlier Wednesday that it hoped California would see the merits of its self-driving vehicle program, including the potential to improve traffic safety, and not create barriers to innovation. \u2018\u2018Pittsburgh, Arizona, Nevada and Florida in particular have been leaders in this way, and by doing so have made clear that they are pro technology. Our hope is that California, our home state and a leader in much of the world\u2019s dynamism, will take a similar view,\u2019\u2019 Anthony Levandowski, the head of Uber\u2019s advanced technology group, wrote on the blog. Uber began matching a small number of riders with vehicles that rely on Uber\u2019s self-driving technology rather than on human drivers Wednesday morning. Those vehicles still had a safety driver on board who could take control if necessary, as well as a company engineer. San Francisco is the second city in the country to officially test Uber\u2019s service, which the company has said will be critical to the future of both ride-hailing and urban transportation. Uber first deployed self-driving vehicles in Pittsburgh three months ago. \u2018\u2018With its challenging roads and often varied weather, Pittsburgh provided a wide array of experiences. San Francisco comes with its own nuances including more bikes on the road, high traffic density and narrow lanes,\u2019\u2019 Levandowski wrote on the blog. The rollout in San Francisco started with just a handful of self-driving vehicles, but it was expected to gradually scale up as more cars become available, a spokeswoman said. Uber has a partnership with Volvo to provide the company\u2019s self-driving vehicles, including the newly released XC90, equipped with a system of lasers and cameras for guidance. Only users with a credit card tied to a San Francisco address are eligible for the program. Those who are matched with a self-driving car will receive an alert that allows them to learn more about the program or to opt out, a spokeswoman said. Uber is the second Silicon Valley company to make self-driving car news this week. Google announced Tuesday that its self-driving car project would be spun off into a separate company, called Waymo. The move is a sign that the company intends to bring the technology to market, though an exact timeline remains unclear.",

        "article": "Kentucky Senator Rand Paul is waking up to something fairly rare: Friendly fire against his outreach to black voters on criminal justice reform. In a walk-up to Paul's expected Tuesday announcement of a presidential bid, the Washington Post quotes Center for Neighborhood Enterprise President Bob Woodson, a frequent freelance tutor in poverty issues to Republicans. \"I find him superficial,\" says Woodson. \"His talk about the militarization of police felt like pandering.\" Like virtually everyone else in national politics, Paul has stopped talking about police militarization. (Police unions popped that particular trial balloon.) But as he readies for a five-state tour of his home state and early primary states, Paul is in the rare position of forcing criminal justice reform into a Republican presidential race. Since at least 2013, his office has collaborated with black leaders in Kentucky on voter restoration and economic development. His pre-campaign operation dodged all questions last week about the Iran deal and the red-state religious freedom laws, but his tour is going to take him to the University of Iowa, the sort of place where he typically leans in on criminal justice reform. \u201cIf you build a big enough bipartisan majority in the Senate, it's going to pass.\u201d If Paul so chooses, he can cement the GOP's role in the reform push\u2013a role that still benefits from the Nixon-to-China, fish-out-of-water coverage conservatives get for leading on reform. Just last week, a story in the New Republic that informed liberals of Georgia Governor Nathan Deal's role in reform and a Huffington Post story about Koch Industries' lobbying for voter rights got thousands of social media shares. Both shared the you're-not-gonna-believe this frame. Conservative reformers appreciate the attention; they're also concerned that the legislation can only pass if they, and not President Obama and civil rights leaders, are the faces of changes. \"If you build a big enough bipartisan majority in the Senate, it's going to pass,\" Newt Gingrich told reporters last month, at a daylong reform conference in Washington. \"There's no question that with Speaker Boehner, Majority Leader McCarthy, Chairman Goodlatte, former Chairman Sensenbrenner, you have huge support in the House. But the trick is to put together a big bipartisan majority in the Senate\u2013to have the president as a reinforcer, and a cheerleader, but have the president really have the patience to allow the legislative process to get a bill he can sign.\" Gingrich's analysis could have come right from the work of Frances Lee, a University of Maryland political scientist who has researched how presidents can harden partisan opposition to a policy simply by coming out in favor of it. \"Whatever people think about raw policy issues, they\u2019re aware that presidential successes will help the president\u2019s party and hurt the opposing party,\" Lee told Ezra Klein in 2012. \u201cIt\u2019s not to say they\u2019re entirely cynical, but the fact that success is useful to the President\u2019s party is going to have an effect on how members respond.\" You could say the same of the people most associated with civil rights causes, like Al Sharpton, whose advocacy can make issues toxic for conservatives. At the Washington conference, I talked with former New York City police commissioner Bernie Kerik, who did a stint in prison and is now basically a full-time reform advocate, about how conservatives could shift the movement away from attention-getting protests. \"All these civil rights leaders that came out, encouraging these protests based on Ferguson, or Eric Garner in New York\u2013 those were two events out of hundreds of thousands of interactions a year with the police,\" Kerik said. \"Two events. You know what? What about this stuff, where there's over-incarceration, where you have an 800 percent increase in the federal prison population over the last 30 years. This country would be far better served by those civil rights leaders fighting for this cause and addressing this than doing what they're doing.\" Paul's run is likely to elevate his reform push\u2013he spent the early part of this year re-introducing bills he can talk about on the trail. The only risk for reformers is that the conservatives who turn on Paul for other reasons might look for vulnerabilities in how he advocated after Ferguson. In speeches, Paul often introduces the reform topic with some awkward words about how the facts of the Michael Brown case were controversial. The people angered by riots in Ferguson would go further, and say that the protests were based on fraud. \"From day one, the first time I was on CNN, hours after the event, I said: Don't be premature,\" said Kerik. \"Wait for conclusions. Wait for evidence\u2013wait for the grand jury. And people were all over the map, condemning the grand jury, condemning the officer, trying to confuse what happened without knowing what happened. We do that too often.\"",

        "article": "A recent study by the Pew Research Center came out with staggering numbers that lent evidence to those crying out for higher wages and wealth equality. Taking into account income, investments, retirement plans, pensions, etc. as of 2013, a white household's wealth was nearly 13 times higher than a minority household's \u2014 and that gap is growing! To put this in more tangible terms: From 2010 to 2013, the median wealth of white households increased from $138,600 to $141,900, or increased by 2.4 percent. Meanwhile, the median wealth of black households fell 33.7 percent, from $16,600 in 2010 to $11,000 in 2013. These are numbers I might expect to see in Third World countries, but not in the world's most thriving democracy. When put into the larger societal context, it's no surprise that racial tension exists in midst of this tumultuous economic conditions. Read More Obama to Expand Overtime Pay to Nearly 5 Million Workers What can we do to help close the wealth gap and create equal financial opportunities for minority Americans? We can focus on fair capitalism while investing in improving educational opportunities for our lower-income citizens. Providing free admission to trade schools and community colleges in order to build a more educated workforce is a great way to bridge that gap. With increased education comes more access to middle- and upper-management jobs, which can encourage investment and retirement savings for struggling minorities. A Tennessee initiative (Drive to 55) offers free education to all resident adults at any of its 27 state institutions. This is having positive impacts on the Tennessee economy and even presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders has recently proposed a bill titled The College for All Act in an effort to make free education a nation-wide phenomenon. Capitalism is the only solution to our wealth inequalities in America. Fair and just practices of capitalism while maintaining principles of social empowerment don't happen by chance, half-measures or handouts. The byproducts of fair capitalism are competition, accountability and opportunity. Unfortunately, some of our nation's entitlement programs are not allies to capitalism. The problems with many of our welfare programs, which are aimed to assist much of our lower-income citizens, is not the program itself, but rather the lack of capitalistic ideals within them. Read MoreConsumer spending rises most in nearly six years Receiving public assistance should be a safety net that helps people get back on their feet \u2014 not a lifestyle. Welfare-recipient programs should include and mandate educational programs and job training. If anyone fails to comply with these government-funded programs, then they should lose some or all of their entitlement. These ideals may come across as a bit harsh, but tax money should be used to empower people if they are physically and mentally able to work. This is accountability. Once this is accomplished, it would hopefully directly lead to people becoming more competitive in the workplace. As long as such a disproportionate number of our minorities are living in poverty, we will continue to see the inequality that provokes acts of discrimination and racism. If we really want to reach a post-racism America, we need to start closing this wealth gap and using fair capitalist ideals to focus on opportunities for EVERY American. This takes a solution based approach that may require states, municipalities, and local governments to redefine their history and design creative solutions.

        "article": "The joke, Brendan Fay recalls, was that peace would come to Northern Ireland before gay people like him would be allowed to take part in New York City\u2019s St. Patrick\u2019s Day parade. Peace came on Good Friday, 1998, but Fay is still trying to march down Fifth Avenue. It\u2019s been a long fight. But he now has some powerful allies. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, both newly-elected, ambitious, self-styled progressives, have said they will boycott their respective city\u2019s St. Patrick\u2019s Day parades if LGBT groups continue to be excluded. Walsh has tried to broker a deal between gay rights advocates and parade organizers, so far without success. De Blasio marched instead in St. Pat\u2019s for All, a counter-parade organized by Fay that welcomes gay groups. Their efforts have largely been symbolic, though on Friday Boston Beer Co., the maker of Sam Adams, withdrew as a sponsor of Boston\u2019s parade because of the exclusion. But the cities have two of the largest and most influential Irish Catholic populations in the nation and the firm stances of their new mayors could finally bring long-simmering tensions to a head. \u201cI\u2019m as Irish as anybody,\u201d Walsh says. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason for this, most certainly in 2014. We\u2019re way beyond this as a country, and I wish we could get way beyond it as a parade. Boston and New York, come on!\u201d Getting beyond it has not been easy. The St. Patrick\u2019s Day celebrations in New York and Boston are permitted by each city but run by private organizations, a distinction that allows parade organizers to bar gay groups from marching. A 1993 federal court decision upheld the right of New York\u2019s parade organizers to exclude groups marching under gay rights banners. Two years later, a 9-0 Supreme Court decision held that gay groups couldn\u2019t force their way into the Boston parade. The two parades have clung to those decisions ever since, even as other parades opened their doors to gay groups. In Dublin, Galway, Cork and other Irish cities, gay and lesbian groups march in St. Patrick\u2019s Day events without incident. Chicago, which has a large Irish Catholic population, has allowed gay groups since the mid-1990s. \u201cOur city realized a long time ago that we have so much more in common than apart,\u201d says Tom Tunney, Chicago\u2019s first openly gay alderman. \u201cWe\u2019re a city of cultures, and the LGBT community is a part of it.\u201d The resistance to inclusion is a stark contrast to the nation\u2019s growing acceptance of gay rights. In recent months, federal judges have struck down state bans on same-sex marriage in Utah, Virginia, Kentucky Oklahoma and Texas and challenges are pending in many others. \u201cOur lives are being discussed and dissected in courts around the country,\u201d Fay says. \u201cWhether you\u2019re a firefighter or a bagpiper or a same-sex family with children, Irish heritage and culture belongs to all of us.\u201d The marriage equality movement began in Massachusetts, when the state\u2019s high court ruled in 2003 that bans on same-sex marriage were unconstitutional. But the St. Patrick\u2019s Day parade in its capital city has been far less welcoming. Every year, gay groups would apply to march through South Boston on St. Patrick\u2019s Day, and every year, with little fanfare, they received denials. The city\u2019s former mayor, Thomas Menino, refused to march in the parade as long as gay groups were excluded \u2014 but that didn\u2019t keep him from politicking on the sidelines of the route. Walsh is a union-backed former state legislator who hails from a working-class neighborhood very much like South Boston, which hosts the city\u2019s parade. He has been an unlikely hero to the city\u2019s gay community since he defied the Catholic Church and voted down a constitutional amendment that would have overturned the court ruling legalizing gay marriage in the state. His efforts to open up the city\u2019s parade \u2014 which have been aided by Stephen Lynch, the conservative Democrat who represents South Boston in Congress \u2013 have put him at odds with two natural constituencies. South Boston was at the epicenter of Boston\u2019s 1970\u2019s busing crisis. Two decades of rampant gentrification have remade much of the neighborhood, but many of the holdouts retain a frayed relationship with the outside world. \u201cThere are some dissidents and it happens that a few of them run the parade,\u201d says Susan Ulrich, a South Boston native who is active in the city\u2019s LGBT community. \u201cThe people who run the parade are fighters, for better or worse. I grew up in a kind and gracious place. But if you back them into a corner, they will fight. If you look at the way the Irish were treated in this country, and the way the LGBT community treated, they\u2019re remarkably similar. Both communities had to fight very hard. But communities that have to fight for every single thing they have, it dies hard.\u201d",

        "article": "Doug Hutchison was once a celebrated film and television actor with acclaimed roles in \u201cThe Green Mile\u201d and \u201cX-Files\u201d to name a few, but when he wed then-16-year-old aspiring model Courtney Stodden, his Hollywood image changed. Now more than two years later, Hutchison and Stodden have become an outlandish staple on reality television with stints on VH1 \u201cCouples Therapy,\u201d and most recently CBS\u2019 \u201cBig Brother UK.\u201d The 53 year old spoke to FOX411 about his unshakeable love for his much younger wife and what lies ahead for their relationship. FOX411: Are you and Courtney planning to have a baby soon? Doug Hutchison: No, not right now. She\u2019s very young. Nine or ten years. I wouldn\u2019t say definitely. We have flirted with the idea of adoption. FOX411: Do you worry about being a much older father? Hutchison: If Michael Douglas can do it, I can do it. I\u2019m young in spirit and have lots of energy. FOX411: Several reports out of London, where Courtney is filming, say she is flirting with other men. What is your response to that? Hutchison: I say nonsense. It\u2019s the press being sensational. The producers on that show want ratings. It\u2019s a bunch of bullshit. Our marriage is so strong. My love for her is unshakeable. With reality TV, they have their finger on the editing button. There seems to be a small fraction of the press that want to see the demise of our marriage. We\u2019ve been married two and a half years.Time is the greatest test. The longer we\u2019re married, as the years unfold people who have had a difficult time with our huge age difference are starting to accept it. FOX411: You were quite open on VH1\u2019s \u201cCouple Therapy\u201d about how marrying Courtney has negatively impacted your career. Does this continue to be the case? Hutchison: My marriage to Courtney did not ruin my career. My agent, my manager dropped me because it was so controversial. Before Courtney I was already becoming disenchanted with acting. I\u2019m a writer. I\u2019m a director. I have not missed acting. When the time is right I\u2019ll jump back in. FOX411: Courtney was very public about her decision to get breast implants. What was your reaction to her decision? Hutchison: It might surprise you but I fought Courtney. God bless Courtney. Courtney was born with an unbelievable body and a beautiful face. When she was contemplating the surgery, I actually was attempting to talk her out of it. Everything was so perfect in my eyes... I woke up one day. Courtney\u2019s body is Courtney\u2019s body. My body is my body. Your body is your body. No one has the right to tell someone what they should do about it. I accepted it and got behind her 110 percent. I think she looks gorgeous with her new boobs\u2026old boobs. FOX411: You\u2019ve taken a role in your wife\u2019s career. Where would you like to see her career go? Hutchison: Courtney is an unbelievable actress. I\u2019m not just saying this. I\u2019ve been an actor for 25 years. I know natural talent. I believe and I would like to see her sink a role into a movie.Also, she loves modeling. I would love Courtney to manifest those dreams and be on the cover of Glamour. She\u2019s a 21st century Renaissance woman. The sky is the limit. Diana Falzone is a FoxNews.com contributor and the advice columnist for My Wingman Diana on Military.com.

        "article": "WASHINGTON, Nov. 15\u2014 Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, the majority leader, was seeing red as well as wearing it this morning at his customary Saturday morning news conference. Clad in a crisply pressed crimson corduroy shirt, buttoned, as usual, to his chin, Mr. Byrd rendered some unusually harsh criticism of the Democratic National Committee. The committee, Mr. Byrd said, had failed the Democratic Party by concentrating on the re-election of President Carter and offering ''far too little assistance to Democratic Senators and House members seeking re-election.'' Party professionals, those who ''lived and breathed politics, those who know something about it,'' had been shut out of the party's organization, he said. ''The general thrust of the D.N.C. must be changed,'' Mr. Byrd said. He said that elected officials and other party professionals had to be given ''some voice in selection of the candidates.'' ''The reforms in the party and its rules were needed to correct abuses,'' he said, ''but I think they went too far.'' Mr. Byrd pledged that he would cooperate with Ronald Reagan if he provided ''new answers'' to complex problems confronting the nation. But he added that Democrats reserved the right to ''constructively disagree.'' ''Mr. Reagan should have his time at bat,'' Mr. Byrd said. ''He'll have to explain his broken campaign promises if he can't make it work.'' Mr. Byrd said he intended to continue his weekly Saturday news conferences after he became the minority leader. He noted that there was something unusual about today's session, one of his last as majority leader: This was the first time in four years, he said, ''that we've begun this session five minutes late.'' Changing of the old guard: Pundits bet that Representative Dan Rostenkowski, Democrat of Illinois, will accept the chairmanship of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, though he has been asked to be majority whip, the third-ranking leadership role in the House. A leading candidate for the whip's post is Representative Thomas S. Foley, Democrat of Washington, outgoing chairman of the House Democratic Caucus. The whip is now Representative John Brademas, Democrat of Indiana, who was defeated Nov. 4. Changing of the new guard: Senator Ted Stevens, the Alaska Republican and Senate's minority whip, has announced that he will seek to retain the second-ranking position in January when Republicans take control of the Senate. Meanwhile, six Republicans are vying to succeed Representative Samuel L. Devine of Ohio, who was defeated in the election, as chairman of the House Republican conference, which includes all party members in the House. The contenders are Representatives Thomas N. Kindness of Ohio, Jack F. Kemp of New York, William F. Goodling of Pennsylvania, Henry J. Hyde of Illinois, Edward J. Derwinski of Illinois, and John H. Rousselot of California. En Garde: Representative Thomas P. O'Neill, the majority leader, and Senator Howard H. Baker Jr., the Republican majority leader-inwaiting, exchanged threats this week over prospective staffing of major committees. Earlier this week, Mr. O'Neill said Democrats planned to preserve the Democratic majority on the three largest House committees, although the Republicans in January will control about 44 percent of the House. On Friday, Mr. Baker urged Mr. O'Neill to rethink his position. ''We can do it too,'' Mr. Baker warned. ''I don't want Tip and me to get into a fight.'' Signs saying ''I'm glad I'm a Democrat'' appeared belatedly this week on office doors of staff aides on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ''It's time to drag out the ol' black pajamas,'' said one aide, predicting protracted guerilla warfare between Senate Republicans and Democrats. The Foreign Relations Committee's Democratic staff is expected to shrink dramatically in January, when Republicans take charge. In gallows humor, Democratic aides circulated a mock application form for positions on the new Republican-controlled staff. Excerpts from the application include the following: Name; Date of Birth; (for Moral Majority members only) Date of second birth. Do you have trilateralist tendencies? Some of the time; All of the time; Only when drunk. Do you think nuclear non-proliferation is: (a) Some of our business. (b) All of our business. (c) None of our business. In the frantic final days of the Congressional session, the White House has found time for one last nomination: Stephen G. Breyer of Massachusetts has been nominated to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. Mr. Breyer has been staff director of the Senate Judiciary Committee, whose outgoing chairman is Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts.",

        "article": "President-elect Donald Trump has made a point of shaking things up. In domestic policy, this taste for disorder is risky. In foreign policy, it could be calamitous. Trump isn\u2019t yet president, so it\u2019s early to be drawing conclusions. But concern is warranted. Trump rejects the status quo in America\u2019s relations with the rest of the world, and seems to see global stability as a kind of national surrender. An early indication of Trump\u2019s approach to international relations is his intervention on Taiwan. The striking thing isn\u2019t that he abandoned, before even taking office, the delicate balance that governs U.S.-China relations with respect to Taiwan. More discomfiting is what he said next. In effect, he asked: Why should the U.S. accommodate China\u2019s wishes on this subject if China refuses to deal fairly with the U.S. on trade? In short, Trump is proposing to connect trade policy to an issue of great-power politics over which China may be willing to go to war. Stir things up to get better deals. (The implication that the U.S. will have nothing to say on Taiwan so long as Beijing gives Trump a trade deal he likes is disturbing in its own right.) This kind of thinking leads nowhere good. The global order designed and built by the U.S. after 1945 has served American and global interests better than anyone dared hope. A widening zone of democracy, avoidance of direct superpower conflicts, the fall of communism, and a liberal system of global trade have hugely benefited the U.S. and an expanding sphere of its partners. This remarkable achievement is not a state of nature. The postwar order was deliberately constructed, often against the odds, and must now be carefully maintained. One way by which this stability has been preserved is by separating points of contention and limiting the extent of possible quarrels. If every dispute between the U.S. and another country implicates every realm of policy, maintaining stability becomes that much harder. Disagreements are apt to escalate, conceivably to the point of military conflict. That\u2019s why it makes sense, for instance, to keep trade policy separate from arguments over borders or sovereignty. This isn\u2019t to say that all is well with the world, or that stability is everything. Trump owes his victory, at least in part, to his ability to exploit a gnawing sense among many Americans that the system isn\u2019t working for them, and he has an obligation to address their concerns. And sometimes the price of stability is too high. For instance, the problem posed by Iran and its nuclear ambitions has been shelved rather than solved. Relations with China, on the other hand, should on the whole be scored a success. It\u2019s gone capitalist, and now (unlike Russia) has a strong material interest in global order. Maybe that interest isn\u2019t yet compelling or overriding for the ruling Communist Party -- but given time, it will be. Note as well that Trump\u2019s attacks on China\u2019s trade practices are ill-advised substantively as well as strategically. China's currency is no longer undervalued. Despite some recent backsliding, its government has taken strides toward liberalizing its trade, its currency system and its capital markets. China is a member of the World Trade Organization and bound by its rules -- as is the United States. Advancing American prosperity demands a new commitment to U.S. competitiveness. Trump is not without ideas on the subject: His plans for tax reform and investment in infrastructure, for example, should be judged with an open mind. But the necessary condition for any of that to work is global stability. There is a difference between recalibrating the international order and upending it. If Trump wants to make America great again, he will need to strengthen, not undermine, America\u2019s greatest achievement. To contact the senior editor responsible for Bloomberg View\u2019s editorials: David Shipley at davidshipley@bloomberg.net.",

        "article": "When he died Nov. 25 at age 90, Fidel Castro was widely remembered as a communist dictator dedicated to spreading violent revolution across Latin America. Some Colombians, however, have come to view him as a peacemaker. After his own guerrilla forces seized power in Cuba in 1959, Castro provided moral authority and support to numerous Colombian guerrilla groups. But he spent his final two decades encouraging them to lay down their weapons. With Castro's blessing, Cuba in 2012 became the host country for peace talks between the Colombian government and the country's largest rebel group, known as the FARC. The day before Castro died, the two sides signed a historic peace treaty bringing an end to Latin America's longest guerrilla war. And in the same week that his ashes made their final journey across the island to Santiago, Colombia's congress approved the peace deal with FARC. \"By the end of his life, Fidel Castro recognized that the armed struggle was not the correct path,\" Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos declared. \"In doing so, he contributed to bringing an end to the Colombian conflict.\" To be sure, not everyone agrees. More than 220,000 people have been killed in Colombia's various guerrilla conflicts, and many blame Castro for promoting and prolonging the country's suffering. On news of Castro's death, Maria Fernanda Cabal, a right-wing Colombian senator, tweeted: \"Today, there is a celebration in hell.\" Still, analysts describe Castro as more of a godfather figure to Colombian revolutionaries, one who never played a dominant role in their uprisings. That's partly because Colombia's rebels were self-financing, earning millions of dollars through extortion, kidnapping, and drug trafficking. Thus, they didn't depend on Cuba or other outsiders for survival. Indeed, some Colombian rebel groups pre-date Castro. The FARC, for example, started out as a group of peasant farmers who took up arms in the 1950s to protect themselves from an outbreak of political violence. They later morphed into a communist insurgency in the early 1960s. FARC leaders admired Castro but often rejected his advice. Otty Pati\u00f1o, a founding member of a now-defunct Colombian guerrilla group called the M-19, said Castro constantly preached about the need for revolutionary unity. But FARC leaders ignored his pleas to unite with the M-19 and other rebel groups to form a single, powerful insurgency. Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, left, and the head of the FARC guerrilla Timoleon Jimenez, aka Timochenko, shake hands during the second signing of the historic peace agreement between the Colombian government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). (Luis Robayo/AFP/Getty Images) Instead, the FARC spent 52 years in a futile effort to seize power \u2014 a sharp contrast to Castro, whose rebel army overthrew Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista in just 25 months. Castro was also a fierce critic of kidnapping and drug trafficking which helped fill the FARC's war chest, Pati\u00f1o said. Castro had closer ties to the National Liberation Army, a Colombian rebel group known as the ELN. It which was founded by university students and Roman Catholic priests, some of whom had received scholarships to study in Cuba in 1962. They began military training on the island then returned to Colombia in 1965 to wage war against the government. Castro did not provide much in the way of money or arms to the ELN. But he allowed the rebels to use the island as a safe haven, a place to recover from war wounds, and as a diplomatic outpost to meet with other insurgents and radical groups from around the Americas, said Le\u00f3n Valencia, a former ELN fighter who is now a Bogot\u00e1 political analyst. Santos gives a speech after signing the new peace accord. He tried to inject a dose of optimism about the hobbled accord whose outlook for implementation is shrouded in uncertainty. (Jaime Saldarriaga/Reuters) \"Fidel was a crucial figure in the life of the ELN,\" Valencia said. Even as the Cold War ended and other rebel groups around Latin America disbanded or were defeated, the Colombian war dragged. Rebels, soldiers and paramilitary groups carried out widespread human rights abuses. By 1993 when Castro made an official trip to Colombia, he had soured on the war. In a speech, he urged the country's guerrillas to \"follow the path of a negotiated peace so that not another drop of blood is spilled.\" Castro became convinced they would have a better chance of taking power through the ballot box. In the late 1990s and 2000s, left-wing governments were elected across much of Latin America. In 2008, Castro published a book called Peace in Colombia in which he urged the country's rebel groups to disarm and form political parties. Speaking of presidents in Venezuela, Bolivia and Ecuador, Adam Isacson of the Washington Office on Latin America, said: \"Fidel's argument has had a lot of credibility over the past 10 to 15 years, as Hugo Chavez, Evo Morales, Rafael Correa and so many other leftist leaders got elected. They carried out revolutions without warfare.\" In Colombia, the M-19 disarmed in the early 1990s and some of its members went on to become successful politicians, including Gustavo Petro who was elected Bogota mayor in 2011. The ELN, which has held exploratory talks with the Colombian government in Cuba, has also pledged to begin formal peace negotiations. But the biggest breakthrough came in 2012 when Cuba \u2014 by then ruled by Castro's brother Raul \u2014 became the site of negotiations aimed at demobilizing the FARC. The resulting peace accord was ratified by the Colombian congress this week and FARC fighters now have about five months to gather in zones around the country and turn in their weapons to UN inspectors. Though not present at the talks, the ailing Castro remained an inspiration to the FARC delegation. After he died Iv\u00e1n M\u00e1rquez, the FARC's chief negotiator, called the Havana peace accord \"our final homage\" to Castro. From the archives: Fidel Castro speaks to CBC in 19591:06",

Why had the IT guy confused me with Chunzi? For the same reason Chunzi\u2019s checks ended up on my desk, my mail ended up in her hands and an editor asked me about my trips to New York, which I never took but Chunzi did. It\u2019s because we\u2019re both young Asian women. We look nothing alike, of course. And it\u2019s not something that happens only to us. Recently two white male journalists mistook my friend Ruth, a fellow Asian American journalist, for me, even though she and I no longer live in the same city. Another time a publicist enthusiastically called Ruth by my name while she was wearing a name tag supplied by the publicist. And a few years ago, a waitress dropped off my check and credit card \u2014 except they belonged to another person with an Asian-sounding name. All my life I\u2019ve been mistaken for other people of my race. It\u2019s a degrading and thoughtless error that boils away my identity and simplifies me as one thing: \u201cthat Asian.\u201d One reason is that our society has so few Asians and people of color in positions of prominence that some people have little exposure to them. Diversity is so lacking in film and television that a director thinks it\u2019s okay to cast a white person as Chinese, as Cameron Crowe did with Emma Stone in \u201cAloha,\u201d and the Hollywood Reporter mistakes \u201cMaster of None\u201d actor Kelvin Yu for show co-creator Alan Yang, who tweeted in response, \u201cSame race, different dude.\u201d This is not unique to Asians. The Golden Globes\u2019 Twitter account mistook America Ferrera for Gina Rodriguez, and the media regularly mixes up black public figures: TMZ confused Nene and Mary J. Blige; a local reporter mistook Samuel L. Jackson for Laurence Fishburne; George Stephanopoulos identified Bill Russell as Morgan Freeman. People look at us without really seeing us. Instead, they simply see our race. [100 times a white actor played someone who wasn\u2019t white.] This phenomenon has a name \u2014 psychologists call it the \u201ccross-race effect,\u201d a well-replicated finding that people are better at telling apart faces of their own race than those of another race. It becomes an even bigger problem in court: Witnesses are more likely to misidentify an alleged perpetrator of another race. Sixty-six of 216 wrongful convictions overturned by DNA testing involved the use of cross-racial eyewitness identifications, according to the Innocence Project. And white participants in one study were significantly more likely to experience a cross-race effect than black participants. Yes, it rarely happens out of malice. Yes, it is often accidental. Yes, it is bumbling, careless, idiotic and unintentional. But it is absolutely not right. After receiving yet another one of Chunzi\u2019s checks on my desk, I wrote a terse email to human resources and copied our managing editor. \u201cThese mistakes,\u201d I wrote, \u201care extremely offensive and unacceptable.\u201d The managing editor called me into his office to apologize, but he rationalized the situation: \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone here\u2019s got a mean bone in their body,\u201d he said. This is part of the problem: White people and even Asians themselves dismiss the issue. We laugh at it because it\u2019s not malicious. The Asian women I\u2019ve spoken to have largely rolled their eyes when this has happened or have tried to be good-humored about it. (Several Asian women I know have switched seats with the other Asians in their offices to see if their white male bosses noticed; they didn\u2019t.) America Ferrera and Eva Longoria recently made fun of these types of errors in a routine at the Golden Globes. Nicole Chung, writing in the Toast, calls these experiences \u201ccasual racism\u201d and notes that, as minorities, we are often afraid of how white people will feel if we call them out. \u201cWhat does our dignity matter, what do our feelings amount to, when we could embarrass white people we care about? When our white relatives or friends or colleagues might experience a moment\u2019s discomfort, anxiety, or guilt?\u201d she writes. People talk now of unconscious bias, which sounds more innocuous than racism. (It\u2019s a particularly popular buzzword at tech companies, which have notoriously non-diverse staffs.) \u201cYou can\u2019t call it racist,\u201d one friend said. \u201cIt\u2019ll just turn people off.\u201d Another friend opined, \u201cIt\u2019s just stepping over social poop piles white people leave.\u201d But in important ways, it is a kind of racism: People swap you for other Asians. They leave a Chinese calendar on your desk (happened to a friend). They grill you about where you\u2019re \u201cfrom.\u201d They ask dumb questions, make dumb statements. Whether or not it\u2019s done out of malice is irrelevant. It\u2019s rude, and it\u2019s racial. I don\u2019t know how to separate myself from other Asians in the eyes of white people. Develop a more unmistakable personality? Embarrass and call them out? The stakes are real at work \u2014 I worry that the reputation of another person will be ascribed to me or that an accomplishment of mine will be attributed to another Asian in the office. But if I speak up, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll disrupt the peace or make a white person uncomfortable, even if they deserve it. I also worry that if I keep quiet, I will explode out of anger from the litany of microaggressions. [Before Beyonc\u00e9 made \u2018Formation,\u2019 Zora Neale Hurston laid out her roadmap] \u201cYou\u2019re so pretty,\u201d a woman at a concert told me. \u201cMy son is marrying a Vietnamese girl. Are you Vietnamese?\u201d You\u2019re so pretty, too! I wanted to say. My cousin is marrying a white guy from Tennessee. Are you from Tennessee? But I didn\u2019t say it. Sometimes I\u2019m so stunned by what\u2019s happening that I\u2019m at a loss for words \u2014 like when a man on the subway announced to me, apropos of nothing, \u201cI was just in Shanghai last week!\u201d But this won\u2019t stop until we learn to speak up. Part of that includes being brave enough to call this phenomenon for what it is: racist. But the onus isn\u2019t just on us inching past our fear of embarrassing a white person. It\u2019s on white people to learn to make distinguishing faces a priority. Whether they realize it or not, the repeated misidentification broadcasts its own message: I\u2019m Asian, indistinct and not worth remembering.",

        "article": "Experts were not impressed by North Korea's first hydrogen nuclear bomb test, and the reviews online were not exactly glowing either. Many people have posted on the nuclear test facility's Google Maps page over the last few years to express cynicism about the country's program. \"Fairly disappointed,\" user Michael Strain wrote recently. \"Approximately 50 KT for a hydrogen bomb? Come on. Russia pulled off 50,000, and designed 100,000. If you are going to threaten to bomb my country, you should at least ensure an instantaneous death for me. Right now you are only capable of preventing me from going to the mall downtown, and then getting blown off the face of the planet in return. If you choose instead to use those chemical weapons, that's just plain rude.\" South Korea's spy agency said the estimated explosive yield was much smaller than a failed H-bomb detonation would produce. Users online had more creative reactions about the test site. \"Went there for my first date,\" Ilja Petin wrote on the Google Maps page. \"Was very impressed, there wasn't any food as we and the rest of the population are still in famine. We drank sea water and we watched free national television with the cutest little dictator ever and sang karaoke to 8bit tunes coming out of a high-tech screensaver.\" \"First the good: no bedbugs,\" wrote Bill Clawson, who gave the \"facility\" three stars. \"The only place in the whole country without bedbugs. I don't remember seeing flies either. No vultures or crows either.\" Another user who went by the name \"E RR\" gave the facility five stars, saying \"of all the barren, post-nuclear, wastelands I have visited this was by far the best.\" \"If anybody needs to test their homemade atomic/nuclear bomb, I highly recommend this place,\" a user who goes by Scott Poop wrote. \"This is about the only nuclear test facility open to the public that I have found and from what I hear, plans are already underway for expansion. To put a cherry on top of the visit, gulag 16 is right down the hwy. Not what I would call a Carlton Ritz but by North Korean standards a real treat. I'll be testing my new nuclear bombs here from now on. Way to go NK!\" Wrote user Rene Schickbauer: \"Went there for my mad scientist practical exam. Their labs are first rate and stocked with everything any mad scientist needs! Huge amounts of electric generators, dangerous chemicals, explosives and a wide variety of nuclear materials. Very friendly and helpful people. They even provided me with a dozen political prisoners free of charge, so i didn't need to handle the nastier stuff myself. Now THAT'S what i call customer support!\" However, a user named Steve Coffman gave the facility only two stars because \"I lost all my hair, and now have thyroid cancer. I would suggest not drinking the water, or eating any root vegetables grown there if you go.\"",

        "article": "Facebook revoked an internship offer to a Harvard student after he launched a controversial Chrome extension that showed your Facebook friends' location down to the nearest meter. Marauder's Map, named after a magical location-tracking map in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter books, highlighted where your friends were, provided those friends also used Messenger on their phones. At that point, Messenger automatically shared users' locations with anyone they messaged. For the few days in May when it worked, Marauder's Map was a Facebook stalker's dream. When I used it, I could track a friend who was in Palo Alto for meetings down to the exact building. Facebook, apparently, was less amused. Aran Khanna told Boston.com that Facebook withdrew its summer internship offer three days after Marauder's Map launched \u2014 because he violated the Facebook user agreement when he scraped the site for data, and also offered an unofficial workaround to use Marauder's Map. Khanna also said that Facebook's head of global human resources and recruiting dinged him because his accompanying Medium post described the way Facebook collected and shared user data \u2014 an approach that seemed to violate the social network's \"high ethical standards\" for interns. Harvard student Aran Khanna's Marauder's Map could accurately track a Facebook friend's movements down to a meter. \"I decided to write this extension because we are constantly being told how we are losing privacy with the increasing digitization of our lives,\" Khanna wrote in the post. \"However, the consequences never seem tangible ... with this code you can see for yourself the potentially invasive usage of the information you share, and decide for yourself if this is something you should worry about.\" A week later, Facebook rolled out a location-based update to Messenger. The update removed the always-on location-sharing feature that enabled the Marauder's Map's stalking abilities. A Facebook spokesperson disputed Khanna's series of events to Mashable, calling his story \"revisionist history\" that omits several points. \"First, we began developing improvements to location sharing months ago, based on input from people who use Messenger,\" the spokesperson told Mashable. \"Second, this mapping tool scraped Facebook data in a way that violated our terms, and those terms exist to protect people's privacy and safety. \"Despite being asked repeatedly to remove the code, the creator of this tool left it up. This is wrong and it\u2019s inconsistent with how we think about serving our community.\u201d As for that internship offer? Facebook told Mashable it was rescinded because Khanna misused user data and put people at risk. Khanna has disputed this, pointing out that Messenger data was technically already available to coders. It didn't help Khanna's case when, after he officially deactivated Marauder's Map, he then made his code available on Github. Khanna did not immediately respond to Mashable's request for comment.

        "article": "Plaxico Burress will continue his N.F.L. career in New York after all \u2014 with the Jets. Burress, the talented but controversial receiver who has not played since shooting himself in the leg in November 2008, agreed in principle to a one-year contract, the team announced Sunday morning. The Jets outfoxed the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Giants \u2014 both of his former teams \u2014 to sign him. According to a person familiar with Burress\u2019s options, the Giants\u2019 offer was based on incentives Burress would have had to earn. While Burress would have likely been able to make more than the $3 million if he reached those benchmarks, which were described as attainable, he opted for the Jets\u2019 guaranteed money. According to ESPN, Burress will make $3.017 million, which is a hefty sum of money for a 33-year-old receiver \u2014 he turns 34 on Aug. 12 \u2014 who has not played in nearly three seasons. It is also unclear whether Burress has worked out for teams, making it difficult to know what type of physical condition he is in. But the Jets, after failing to sign the shutdown cornerback Nnamdi Asomugha, were eager to make a bold move in free agency. At 6 feet 5 inches, Burress provides Mark Sanchez with a tall, sure-handed deep threat, a complement to the speedy Santonio Holmes \u2014 like Burress, another former top draft pick of the Steelers \u2014 who re-signed with the Jets last week. The arrival of Burress, who caught the winning touchdown pass in Super Bowl XLII in 2008 for the Giants, surely spells the end of Braylon Edwards\u2019s tenure with the Jets. Like Edwards, Burress cut a provocative figure in New York. He was perpetually late to meetings, often could not practice because of injuries and held out of Giants minicamp in May 2008. The incident that defined his career occurred in the early hours of Nov. 29, 2008, not long after he was considered unfit to play in the Giants\u2019 game at Washington because of a strained hamstring: Burress shot himself in the leg at a New York nightclub, which resulted in a 22-month prison stay on weapons charges. He was released June 6. Back in the spring of 2009, after he had been released by the Giants but when his playing and legal status were still uncertain, Burress met with the owner of the Jets, Woody Johnson, and the team\u2019s general manager, Mike Tannenbaum, in Florida.",
