        "article": "Two soldiers, one a Buckingham Palace guard, walked free from court yesterday despite inflicting a shocking beating on a helpless civilian. During the drunken attack, which was caught on CCTV, Scots Guard Shaun Smith, 25, can be seen stamping 18 times on his victim\u2019s head. His fellow soldier, Welsh Guard Jason Collins, 22, rained blows with his fists on to the man\u2019s body. Scroll down for video . CCTV cameras captured the horrifying attack last April in which soldiers Shaun Smith (left, in black jeans) and Jason Collins (right, bending over), kicked and punched two men repeatedly near their barracks . Collins, 22, (right) has been stationed at Buckingham Palace since the attack. Smith (left), was described as an 'angel' in court by his officer . The soldiers were expected to be jailed for the \u2018deeply unpleasant and inexcusable\u2019 assault. But yesterday a judge at Teesside Crown Court made what even he admitted was an \u2018extraordinary\u2019 decision to let the men walk free. Judge James Hill, QC, said he had decided to show mercy after hearing glowing tributes and being told the Army was keen to keep them. \u2018I state in open court that what I have done is entirely exceptional,\u2019 he said. \u2018I can\u2019t say what the Army will do but I simply express the hope, as your commanding officers have expressed, that the Army feels able to keep you.\u2019 The furious victim James Wormald \u2013 who was left with the imprint of Smith\u2019s shoe on his forehead \u2013 said it was wrong that the pair had got off so lightly and that there was no excuse for what had happened. \u2018There was absolutely no reason for the attack,\u2019 he said. \u2018To stamp on someone that many times and get away with only being sentenced for actual bodily harm is wrong. With one of their victims motionless on the ground the pair begin to chase the second across the main road near their barracks at Catterick Garrison in North Yorkshire . Reaching for his neck, Collins tries to grab the man before the pair chase him round a tree and back onto the road . After dragging the man onto the ground Collins is seen raising his fists and punching him repeatedly in the face . The pair earlier claimed they had been followed out of a nightclub by the victims who threatened to stab them. A judge rejected their version of events, saying the man seen in the footage (above) posed 'no threat' when they were beating him . \u2018I don\u2019t know how I escaped that without really serious injuries, the force they used could have killed me and I really expected them to go to jail for it.\u2019 Both men were cleared by a jury of grievous bodily harm but admitted causing actual bodily harm. Smith was given a 12-month suspended jail sentence and ordered to do 80 hours of unpaid work. Collins was given a 12-month community order, and both men were each told to pay \u00a31,000 compensation. The maximum penalty for a single count of occasioning actual bodily harm is five years imprisonment according to the Crown Prosecution Service's sentencing guidelines. With both Smith and Collins found guilty of two counts each, the soldiers could have faced sentences of ten years. Instead they both walked free from court in what even the judge in the case described as 'exceptional'. In the most lenient circumstances a sentence of one year in custody is advised. Smith was given a 12 month sentence suspended, while Collins received a 12-month community order. The pair launched the vicious attack after a night\u2019s heavy drinking near Catterick Garrison in North Yorkshire last April. They matched each other drink for drink in bars and each downed six beers and 15 shots. They encountered local men Mr Wormald, 25, and his friend Mark Thompson after leaving a bar at 3.30am and there was an exchange of words. Collins and Smith claimed the two men had threatened to stab them \u2013 a claim strongly denied by Mr Wormald, a chef. The court was shown video of Collins knocking Mr Thompson out cold with a single punch before he and Smith set upon Mr Wormald. Their victim runs across a road, trips and falls. Smith, who has a hood covering his face, can be seen bringing his foot down over and over on his victim\u2019s head while Collins relentlessly pummels Mr Wormald\u2019s body. The pair then ran off and hid in a stream, but were caught by the police. Mr Wormald had severe bruising to his face. Collins is highly regarded by the Welsh Guards and has been entrusted to stand guard at both Buckingham Palace and St James\u2019s Palace since the incident. He is likely to keep his job. Scots Guard Smith was also of previous good character. Richard Herrmann, defending him, said: \u2018But for that night this man is an angel, but on that night he was a devil.\u2019 Captain James Dyson said Smith had \u2018picked himself up\u2019 since and \u2018is proving to be one of the best performing people in his platoon\u2019. Outside court Detective Constable Andy Palmer said: \u2018This is the most violent piece of CCTV footage I have seen in ten years as a police officer and it is extremely fortunate the victims were not more seriously injured. This case highlights the horrors of alcohol-fuelled violence.\u2019",

        "article": "Lucas Leiva would like to remind people it is not just Steven Gerrard playing out his own emotional journey in Sunday's FA Cup semi-final against Aston Villa at Wembley. The Brazilian has been at Anfield for eight years and holds the unwanted record of playing more games for Liverpool without winning a major trophy than anyone else in 50 years. He missed the 2012 League Cup final and two other Wembley appearances that year with a serious knee injury sustained against Chelsea the previous November. His story might not have the celebrity appeal of Gerrard saying goodbye in an FA Cup final on his 35th birthday, but the desire to win the Cup is just as strong. Lucas has been the longest-serving player at Liverpool behind captain Steven Gerrard (right) Lucas has played more games for Liverpool without winning a major trophy than anyone else in 50 years . \u2018I\u2019ve played at the Maracana a few times but never at Wembley,\u2019 said Lucas, 28. \u2018I have been dreaming about it, to be honest. I\u2019ve been at Liverpool so long. Gerrard deserves to win the FA Cup after what he has done for this club. He has won many trophies here but a lot of people here have been working for many years and not won as much as him. We want to win like him.\u2019 When Lucas was signed by Rafa Benitez in 2007, Liverpool had just been in their second Champions League final in three seasons. But he has had to endure turbulent times since then; four managers and a change of ownership that dragged Liverpool into virtual civil war. Not surprisingly, the cup finals and trophies dried up. \u2018I didn\u2019t think I was going to stay this long. I felt after the first season I was gone,\u2019 said Lucas with a laugh, having been pilloried by the Kop during his early days. \u2018There have been big changes in the club during my time here and at some point you pay a price for that. Sunday will mark Steven Gerrard\u2019s 36th, and possibly last, appearance at Wembley. Thirty-two of his games have been there for England (including one at the old Wembley) and three for Liverpool. Wembley record for England P32 W24 D4 L4 Goals 8 . Wembley record for Liverpool P3 W1 D1 L1 Goals 0 . Three Wembley highlights . England 2-0 Ukraine - 2000 . Makes his England debut at the old Wembley the day after his 20th birthday and impresses enough to earn a place in Kevin Keegan\u2019s Euro 2000 squad. Plays for 81 minutes before replaced by Kieron Dyer. England 2-0 USA - 2008 . Scores his first goal at the new national stadium when he sidefoots Gareth Barry\u2019s pass past American goalkeeper Brad Guzan. Liverpool 2-1 Everton- 2012 . Having lifted the League Cup earlier in the season, Gerrard returned to Wembley for a sweet FA Cup semi-final victory against their Merseyside rivals, with Andy Carroll heading a late winner. \u2018There was discussion about ownership, the court and all that. It didn\u2019t help. We saw a lot of senior players leaving. This is a chance for our new team to win their first trophy.\u2019 Lucas has gone from an impressionable youngster learning from Gerrard, Pepe Reina and Xabi Alonso to one of the senior voices in the dressing room. He has seen youngsters Raheem Sterling and Jordon Ibe criticised for being photographed with a shisha pipe and said: \u2018It is hard to give advice because there are so many people always around players. I just think young players shouldn\u2019t get carried away. I had real role models in the dressing room like Pepe and Stevie. You saw they had success because of the way they do things, not just their talent. \u2018Ten years ago, players would have more space. Today we go to a restaurant and everyone is filming, recording or taking pictures. You need to have extra care. If you are having a glass of wine, then people say you are drunk.\u2019 Lucas tries to win a tackle during Liverpool's 2-0 victory at home to Newcastle on Monday night . Lucas celebrates Joe Allen's (right) second goal for Liverpool against Newcastle . Lucas is desperate to win the FA Cup and end his 270-game barren spell at Anfield. The last player to have played more times for Liverpool without winning a major trophy was Alan O\u2019Court who played for the club 345 times between 1952 and 1964, collecting just a Second Division championship medal. Liverpool felt so sorry for Lucas, who was injured for the 2012 League Cup final win, they asked the Football League to send him a medal in the post. Liverpool\u2019s improvements under Rodgers have not so far translated into silverware. They finished second to Manchester City in a thrilling Premier League title race last season and were beaten by eventual winners Chelsea in this year\u2019s Capital One Cup semi-finals. Brendan Rodgers knows, with a far stronger squad than he inherited in 2012, they now have to take the cup competitions seriously. \u2018For me, the objective in the first couple of years was getting into the Champions League,\u2019 he said. \u2018If you look at how we did in the cups we weren\u2019t so good. I felt we didn\u2019t have the squad to challenge. This year we\u2019d arrived into the Champions League and could focus on winning a trophy. We have got to one semi-final already in the Capital One Cup and now we\u2019ve got another chance. Our vision is to win trophies.\u2019 Gerrard has returned to the squad after a three-match ban from being sent off against Manchester United . Gerrard (right) made his Wembley debut for England in 2000 in a friendly against Ukraine . The return of Gerrard into the squad after a three-match ban for stamping on Manchester United\u2019s Ander Herrera is vital to calm any nerves. In contrast to Lucas and others in the Liverpool team, he has played at Wembley 35 times in his career \u2014 and been on the winning side in 25 of them. Rodgers smiles that he will be \u2018heartless\u2019 in deciding whether to name his captain in the starting XI but is adamant Gerrard will make a big contribution. \u2018I\u2019ve had a meal with him, talking over things,\u2019 said the manager. \u2018I am disappointed I didn\u2019t have the chance to work with him for longer. At 24, I would have built a team around him like I did with Luis Suarez. \u2018Wembley is like his second home. He knows what it takes to win there. He\u2019s calm anyway before the games and that is important for us as a team. Everyone respects that I want to do what is best for the team. Status and star quality have never bothered me, really.\u2019",

Kathrin Goldbach and her family are said to be so afraid of being blamed for the Germanwings crash - caused by Lubitz after he flew the plane he was co-piloting into the French Alps \u2013 that they have fled the town and vowed to never return. The 26-year-old maths teacher, her rescue volunteer brother Andreas and their parents told friends they do not plan to return to their home in the centre of the close-knit rural community of Montabaur. Scroll down for video . Kathrin Goldbach, the girlfriend of killer pilot Andreas Lubitz, and her family, including her brother Andreas (pictured left and right), have reportedly fled their home in Montabaur and have no plans to return . A friend of the distraught family said: \u2018The girlfriend of the co-pilot has nothing to do with what happened. \u2018But the hatred of the world is coming down upon her, and you know this place is so small, it is very hard for them to come back here. \u2018They would have to look to find somewhere to stay around here if they wanted to get away. It is just not possible for them to keep a low profile so they are not coming back. \u2018It is so much easier if you live in Dusseldorf or somewhere like that. \u2018But for the parents to come back here, it was almost impossible for them, it is just too small a town.\u2019 An extremely shaken Miss Goldbach, who is seeking comfort from a priest, told investigators that her long-term boyfriend Lubtiz had whisked her away on holiday just days before his death. Kathrin Goldbach and her family are said to be afraid of being blamed for the Germanwings crash, caused by Andreas Lubitz after he flew the plane he was co-piloting into the French Alps .

Family members were also said to have joined the couple \u2013 who first met while working in a local Burger King as teenagers - on the final holiday. Miss Goldbach left her teaching job in Montabaur after Lubitz qualified as a pilot in 2013 and the pair moved to a flat in Dusseldorf. She got a job in a secondary school in a town called Krefeld just outside of the city. The young teacher also confirmed that in the weeks before the crash he had bought \u2018his and her\u2019 luxury Audi\u2019s for himself and Miss Goldbach. Yesterday, it was claimed that footage showing the last few seconds inside the doomed flight had been found among the wreckage of the crash site . French prosecutor Brice Robin has called for anyone with footage of the plane crash which killed 150 people to hand it over to the authorities . A source close to the investigation said: \u2018His girlfriend was very nervous in the interview. She had a female minister with her to try to keep her calm but she was wringing her hands and was very tense. \u2018She knew he was ill but had no idea he was in this state of mind. He showed no signs of suicidal thoughts.\u2019 Yesterday French prosecutor Brice Robin called for anyone with footage of the plane crash which killed 150 people to hand it over to the authorities. The demand came after German and French media reported having seen a video recording showing the final chaotic scenes of the flight as it hurled towards the Alps mountainside.

        "article": "A football fan is facing a three-year ban after running topless onto a pitch and performing a series of somersaults during his first ever game at the stadium. Charlie Sumner, 20, staged a one-man pitch invasion at Reading's Madejski Stadium during the team's FA cup quarter final replay with Bradford City last month. The Reading supporter, whose team were 3-0 up at the time, did four front flips on the pitch, landing on his back each time, before being tackled by stewards. Charlie Sumner, 20, staged a one-man pitch invasion at Reading's Madejski Stadium during their quarter final replay with Bradford City last month (pictured) The Reading supporter, whose team were 3-0 up at the time, did four front flips on the pitch, landing on his back each time . Sumner - who said going to his first game was a 'brilliant experience - is now facing a potential three-year ban for carrying out the stunt. The order, due to be decided on April 30, would stop him going to all Reading's future home and away matches. Today, Sumner, from Wokingham, Berkshire, said he has no regrets about the incident, saying that he had done it for 'laugh' and that his family had 'seen the funny side'. Speaking outside court, he said: 'After doing it and seeing good comments and messages, even from the away fans, I don't look back and regret it. 'Obviously I wouldn't inform other people to do it. It was just spur of the moment. It's good to see good feedback and not negative feedback. 'I'd had a few drinks, I was happy and Reading were winning and I just went for it and had a laugh. It was brilliant.' Asked whether he goes to many Reading matches, he added: 'That was my first game actually. It was a good experience. Obviously being there on the first game - not after what I've done, but standing in the stadium, watching the game from the stadium - it's a brilliant experience. 'Obviously with the ban, I wouldn't be able to experience that experience again.' Charlie Sumner, pictured outside Reading Magistrates' Court today. He is facing a potential banning order . After running onto the pitch, Sumner was tackled by stewards. The footage of Sumner's antics went viral . The incident took place on March 16, when the match was being broadcast live to millions of viewers on BBC One. Afterwards, footage of Sumner's antics also went viral on the internet. Sumner, who went to the match with a group of eight friends, said he talked with his friends in a taxi on the way to the match about potentially running on to the pitch. 'I did say no at first. Then Reading were winning and I got a bit excited,' he said. 'I went to rave on Friday and there's another video on Facebook and I'm doing flips there. I've had a few selfies, a few drinks bought for me.' Sumner said he spoke to friends on the way to the stadium about carrying out the stunt. He said he had no regrets and that his family had seen 'the funny side' But Sumner, who works as a dry liner fixing ceilings, said he thought a potential football banning order 'seemed a bit much.' 'I don't want a three year ban because obviously it's quite a bit,' he said. 'I'm not encouraging people do it and if I go to another game, I'm not going to do it again.' At today's hearing, Sumner's solicitor entered a guilty plea on his client's behalf to one count of going on to a playing area at a football match under the Football Offences Act 1991. Sumner, who was at court but missed his hearing after leaving the building briefly, was released on bail with conditions that he does not attend Reading's home or away matches. He will appear at Reading Magistrates' Court on April 30 when a decision will be made on whether he receives a football banning order.",

The Tottenham winger has been one of the more impressive performers since moving to Goodison Park in the winter transfer window. Lennon, 28, has just four more matches to impress as he is ineligible to play against his parent club on the final day of the season and Martinez said that must be the priority for all concerned. Aaron Lennon (right) has four games remaining of his loan spell at Everton from Tottenham . Roberto Martinez wants to get the most out of Lennon in the time he has left at Goodison Park . Martinez said discussions about Lennon's future will come at the end of the Premier League season . 'Aaron is enjoying his football and his contribution to the team has been significant,' said the manager. 'He has got four games left and all I want is for him to enjoy every single second of it and make sure he enjoys the experience as much as we have benefited from his talent. 'Then, at the end of the season, will be the moment to sit down. A loan is a loan and it means that we are looking for a successful outcome out of that. 'Then, when the loan finishes, you have got a three-way conversation to see where that will take us. 'But the focus now is to see 'Azza' enjoying his football in the next four games.' Reports have linked Lennon with a swap deal with Toffees' forward Kevin Mirallas come the summer, with the Belgium international's future at Goodison uncertain after declaring in February he was looking for a new challenge. Mirallas scored on his first start since early March with the only goal against Burnley and Martinez is looking for the 27-year-old to finish the season strongly. 'Kevin is a special player for us,' Martinez told evertontv. 'He brings a goalscoring threat that is so important in football. It's good to see that Kevin is well over his injury now and can challenge for a place in the team. Martinez also praised the attacking talents of Kevin Mirallas (right) and rejected reports he could exit the club . Reports have linked Mirallas (right) with a switch to Tottenham with Lennon signing with Everton permanently . 'It's great to have as many players like Kevin fit and available because it gives you different opportunities to show a threat to the opposition. 'I'm looking forward to seeing how strong Kevin can finish the season now.'",

        "article": "Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure is a dream target for Inter Milan, according to general director Marco Fassone. The Italian giants are keen to sign the 31-year-old this summer, a player Inter coach Roberto Mancini knows well having guided him from 2010 until 2013 at the Barclays Premier League club. Gazzetta dello Sport claim Inter are prepared to submit an offer of 60million euros (\u00a343million) for the Ivory Coast international, who is under contract with the Blues outfit until June 2017. Serie A side Inter Milan hope to sign Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure (front) this summer . Inter general director Marco Fassone fears City's asking price and Toure's wages could be too much . 'Who doesn't dream of having a player like him? Toure would give our midfield line something that we are lacking,' Fassone told Italian sports newspaper Tuttosport. 'But his wages and City's asking price might be a big obstacle.' Toure has scored seven goals and set up one more in 22 Premier League appearances this term for City. Inter are also working on new deals for their Argentina forward Mauro Icardi and Croatia midfielder Mateo Kovacic. Icardi is Inter's top scorer this season with 15 goals and is tied to the Nerazzurri for a further three seasons, while Kovacic, who is a reported target of Liverpool, is under contract with inter until June 2019. Inter striker Mauro Icardi is on the verge of signing a new contract with the club, according to Marco Fassone . Mateo Kovacic, pictured celebrating a goal against Cagliari, is also in talks over an extended deal . 'We are almost there with respect to Icardi's contract extension,' Fassone said. 'We want to keep him just as we want to keep Kovacic. 'We will evaluate with great care (their) eventual offers. 'It's clear that if we want to sign three players (this summer) we will need to evaluate those that will depart.' Inter's priority right now is to tie Inter goalkeeper Samir Handanovic to a long-term contract. Goalkeeper Samir Handanovic, pictured against Napoli, has been linked with Roma and Manchester United . The Slovenia international has been linked with Roma as well as Manchester United and becomes a free agent next season. 'Handanovic's renewal is an issue that we must resolve at once,' Fassone said. 'We need to understand what he wants. 'We cannot go into next season knowing that our goalkeeper's contract expires.' Inter are currently 10th in Serie A with 10 league games remaining.",

        "article": "The flag-burning father of a runaway British jihadi schoolgirl yesterday admitted taking his daughter to an extremist rally when she was 13. Abase Hussen \u2013 who blamed police for failing to stop his daughter fleeing to join IS earlier this year \u2013 conceded the teenager was \u2018maybe\u2019 influenced by the rally organised by banned terror group Al-Muhajiroun. Mr Hussen told MPs last month, after his daughter Amira Abase fled to Syria aged 15, that he could think of \u2018nothing\u2019 to explain why she and two friends had decided to join IS, as well as keeping quiet about his own links to radicalism. Scroll down for video . Abase Hussen, left, took his daughter Amira, right, to a demonstration when she was aged just 13 . Abase Hussen, circled, \u00a0marched at the head of a violent rally held by Muslim extremists in London in 2012 . It then emerged he had been in caught in shocking video footage amid a flag-burning mob, screaming in rage at a protest outside the US embassy in London, in 2012. Also at the rally were hate cleric Anjem Choudary and Michael Adebowale, one of the killers of Fusilier Lee Rigby. He has now apologised for attending, but admitted going to two further rallies \u2013 with his impressionable daughter in tow. One took place outside the Saudi embassy in London, in 2013, and is said to have been organised by the Islamic extremist group Al-Muhajiroun, founded by hate cleric Omar Bakri Mohammed and linked to many Islamic terror atrocities of the past decade. Yesterday Mr Hussen, who went to this rally and another similar one with his daughter and wife Fetia, conceded they might have influenced the youngster, who would have been 13 at the time. \u2018The only reason we took her first time, was because there was no one to look after her and we both felt it important to go,\u2019 he said. The rally was held against the treatment of Ethiopians in Saudi Arabia after human rights violations, and Mr Hussen, 47, who is from Ethiopia, said: \u2018We both lost many people back home, we wanted to try to get help for people back home, too many human rights violations there. Many died. Maybe it influenced her.\u2019 Amira was one of three girls from Bethnal Green Academy in East London who flew to Turkey before being smuggled across the border into Syria in February. Soon after, in an extraordinary exchange at the home affairs select committee, Mr Hussen blamed the authorities for failing to stop his daughter running off to Syria. Asked by chairman Keith Vaz if Amira had been exposed to any extremism, Mr Hussen replied: \u2018Not at all. Nothing.\u2019 Yesterday respected analyst Shiraz Maher, senior fellow at The International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at King\u2019s College London, tweeted: \u2018Remember that Amira Abase\u2019s father blamed the police for his daughter going to Syria and effectively misled Parliament with this nonsense.\u2019 Mr Hussen told The Times yesterday that he felt ashamed to have been at the flag-burning rally. He said: \u2018I went to show my feelings because my religion was being insulted, my faith. Protesting is not radical, it is our right.\u2019 Amira Abase, pictured, was one of three girls who flew from Gatwick to Turkey before crossing to Syria . Asked why he was pictured at the front of the mob, he said: \u2018The crowd pushed me. I feel tricked. I did not know who they [the organisers] were. I just followed the crowd, I feel ashamed.\u2019 Mr Hussen came to Britain from Germany in 1999 and said he came \u2018for democracy, for the freedom, for a better life for children, so they could learn English\u2019. He said he was upset with his daughter joining IS, saying she was \u2018just a normal kid who is a victim of extremists\u2019. Mr Hussen said he felt \u2018terrible\u2019 to know he had been protesting with one of Mr Rigby\u2019s killers and said: \u2018It was brutal, it has nothing to do with Islam, it is not human. You don\u2019t do things like this.\u2019 Amira fled to become a \u2018jihadi bride\u2019 with her friends Shamima Begum, 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16. A fourth girl from their school, Sharmeena Begum, left for Syria in December. Giving evidence to the MPs\u2019 committee, Mr Hussen accused police of not doing enough to warn him and other parents. Last night Tory MP Michael Ellis, who sits on the committee, said: \u2018I would certainly be in favour of Mr Hussen being recalled to give him a full opportunity to explain what he clearly did not when he appeared before us. \u2018It\u2019s shocking and outrageous anyone would think it appropriate to take their 13-year-old to such a rally. But then to tell a House of Commons committee you have no idea why a young teenager should seek to travel to Syria, when you have taken her to more than one of these events, is simply breathtaking.\u2019",

        "article": "Mark Lawson, 44, (pictured) was spared jail today after stabbing a colleague with a steak knife in a bizarre argument about onion rings . A pub diner who stabbed a work colleague in the leg with a steak knife in a row over his onion rings was spared jail today. Builder Mark Lawson, 44, was in The Diamond Tap public house in Newbury, Berkshire for his Christmas party when he agreed that his co-worker Simon Myers could take some chips from his plate. However, when Mr Myers started eating an onion ring, Lawson was angered, shouted at his victim and drove the knife into his thigh. Simon Blackford, for the prosecution, told Reading Crown Court that Lawson had been drinking with his colleagues at the festive party when he ordered a burger, chips and onion rings. He said: 'The defendant ordered a burger and chips and onion rings and some of his colleagues, including Mr Myers, took an onion ring and that gave rise to a somewhat explosive reaction. 'The defendant said \"don't you come between me and my onion rings\" and there was clearly some talk about that.' However, one of two colleagues, including Mr Myers then joked about taking more of his onion rings. At that point, Lawson 'reacted in a very loud way' to what was happening and stabbed Mr Myers with the steak knife he was clutching. The knife tore into Mr Myers's leg, causing a bloody wound nearly two inches deep, in front of the pub full of horrified onlookers on December 19 last year. Speaking for the defence, John Simmons said that Lawson had been battling a drinking problem and even visited Alcohol Anonymous for a short while to steer clear of the booze. Mr Simmons said Lawson, who lives in Thatcham in Berkshire, had been clean for six months and his decision to drink was a 'one-off' that he deeply regretted. 'This is an incident that started out as a joke but didn't end up that way', he added. 'Before this Christmas party he was almost minded not to attend and now of course regrets the fact he did. 'He hasn't drunk from that day to this.' Lawson 'reacted in a very loud way' when colleagues, including Mr Myers, stole his onion rings from his plate . Lawson took offence to his work colleagues attempting to steal his onion rings . The court heard Lawson was an exemplary employee who worked six days a week at a construction site at Newbury Racecourse. 'He comes across as an extremely affable, very likeable man,' said Mr Simmons. 'He is clearly a very hard working man and cannot believe how much trouble he has got himself into. He realises he is someone who just cannot drink.' Appealing for a suspended jail sentence, Mr Simmons told the court Lawson had apologised to Mr Myers and the two had been very mature about the unsavoury\u00a0episode. Recorder Patrick Hamlin accused Lawson of putting his steady job and working life in jeopardy by drinking too much and carrying out the 'bizarre' attack. 'You were in trouble with the police and the courts quite a lot when you were younger but for the last 20 years you have stayed well clear of trouble,' he said. 'You have kept a steady job, you are working long hours usually six days a week. You put that all in jeopardy when at a Christmas function last year you drank too much. 'You lost your temper with a fellow employee over a bizarre issue - the stealing or a joke about stealing the onion rings from your plate. You were incensed by that conduct and you stabbed your fellow employee in the leg.' At a Christmas party last year at the Diamond Tap Wetherspoons in Newbury, Berkshire (pictured), Lawson stabbed his colleague Mr Myers with a steak knife following a row over his onion rings . However Recorder Hamlin spared him jail and sentenced him to a six-month prison sentence suspended for a year as well as a 12-month curfew. 'I am not regarding this as a case, that happens unhappily so often, when someone goes out armed and for a fight,' he added. 'This is a case where you had a knife in your hand simply to eat your meal. It is an unusual case. You acted out of character.' He also ordered Lawson to pay \u00a3250 in compensation to Mr Myers and \u00a3350 towards prosecution costs. Lawson had admitted one count of unlawful wounding, but denied wounding with intent. Recorder Patrick Hamlin told Reading Crown Court (pictured) that Lawson put his job in jeopardy when he 'drank too much' at a Christmas function in December last year .",

Sebastian Rode scored in the 38th minute and Hoffenheim's Andreas Beck added an own goal in stoppage time as Bayern, with youngsters Mitchell Weiser and Gianluca Gaudino in the lineup, opened a 13-point lead over second-placed VfL Wolfsburg, in action against Schalke 04 on Sunday, with five matches left. The German champions, who host Porto on Tuesday in the Champions League quarter-final second leg after Wednesday's 3-1 loss, were without half a dozen starters, including Philipp Lahm, Arjen Robben, Franck Ribery and Bastian Schweinsteiger. Thomas Muller celebrates after\u00a0Hoffenheim's Andreas Beck scored a stoppage time own goal . But goalkeeper Manuel Neuer was in top form, spectacularly denying Anthony Modeste at point blank range after a defensive blunder by Brazilian Dante. Rode then made the most of Bayern's second chance of the game, curling his shot from the edge of the box past keeper Oliver Baumann. Rode was lucky not to be penalised for bringing down Eugen Polanski in the area a minute later but there was no denying the dominance of Bayern, who came close again when Robert Lewandowski scraped the bar at the start of the second-half. They did get a second goal when Thomas Mueller charged into the box and cut the ball back to the unfortunate Hoffenheim captain Beck who slipped the ball into his own net.

An idyllic two-bedroom log cabin, nestled down a private country lane in the heart of the New Forest, has gone on the market for \u00a3350,000 . The 76-sq ft hideaway, based near the tiny Hampshire hamlet of Newgrounds, near Godshill, is made entirely from timber imported from Norway . Its ideal location means the cabin is worth more than twice what a similar bolthouse would be worth elsewhere. It has 141,000 acres of forest surrounding the cabin . But its ideal location  means the cabin is worth more than twice what a similar bolthole would be worth elsewhere. For the same amount, buyers could own a three-bedroom Grade II-listed former school house just a few miles down the road in Ringwood. A four-bedroom detached bungalow with a huge garden in the New Forest town of Holbury is also for sale for \u00a3350,000. The aptly-named Log Cabin could be a suitable home for a small family or couple, with two bedrooms, a sizeable living room and a balcony which looks onto a south-facing garden. Despite looking like an ideal holiday retreat, the cabin also comes with permission to live in it all year round. But the real selling point is the 141,000 acres of forest that surround the cabin. The aptly-named Log Cabin could do for a small family, with two bedrooms, a sizeable living room (pictured), and a balcony which looks onto a south-facing garden . Despite looking like an ideal holiday retreat, the cabin also comes with permission to live in it all year round . The property was built in 2004 by the owners of the next door home who needed a place to stay while their house was refurbished. They are now selling the log cabin as they no longer need it. Kesia Whitfield, from estate agents Symonds and Sampson, said: 'The Log Cabin is down an unmade track. It's a no through road so it's very quiet and the owner would have direct access to picturesque forest walks from there. 'What's special about this one is you can live in it 365 days a year. They've got planning permission to live there all year round, not just for holiday lets.' She added: 'We think it will appeal to people looking for a New Forest bolthole or as an investment holiday let but also somebody who wants to live in the New Forest that hasn't got a huge budget. The property was built in 2004 by the owners of the next door home who needed a place to stay while their house was refurbished . Some 80 per cent of the enquiries have reportedly been from people who want to live in the cabin full-time . The property is situated in the New Forest, the former hunting ground of William the Conquerer. Pictured: The bathroom in the property . 'This is a great way to have your own little bit of the forest. You have got access to miles and miles of forest walks and spectacular far-reaching views over the forest heathland.' She said 80 per cent of the enquiries were from people who wanted to live there full time. She said:\u00a0'You might get similar holiday homes in holiday parks for half the price, but there you're on a camping site and you can only stay a certain amount of days.' According to property website Rightmove, the average price of a house in the New Forest is just shy of \u00a3370,000. The New Forest was created as a royal hunting enclave in 1079 when King William I, also known as William the Conquerer, wanted somewhere to hunt. Ten centuries on, the Forest is still largely in royal hands, with around 90 per cent of it belonging to the Crown. It became a National Park in 2005. The park, measuring 571 square kilometres, is set in a rough triangular shape across a large portion of Hampshire. It is bounded by Christchurch in the south west, Southampton in the east, and Fordingbridge and Redlynch in the north. A foal walking in the New Forest. The National Park in Hampshire is home to around 3,000 ponies . The forest is also famed for the New Forest pony, one of the recognised native breeds of the British Isles. There are estimated to be around 3,000 roaming the area. The countryside also boasts countless cycling and walking paths, as well as several decent museums and a host of famous country pubs. Bizarrely, the New Forest is also linked with one of Britain's most enduring mysteries. William Rufus, the Conqueror's son and successor, was shot and killed by a stray arrow while hunting in the Forest in 1100. Whether he was assassinated or  the victim of an accident remains a matter of debate. The Rufus Stone, a small memorial near Stoney Cross in the heart of the Forest, marks the spot where he reputedly fell.

        "article": "Surgeons have removed kidneys that each weighed as much as a newborn baby from an Indian man with a genetic disorder. The giant internal organ reportedly weighed a colossal 6lbs (2.7kg) - and was 20 times bigger thanit should have been. It was was extracted from a 45-year-old suffering from autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). This condition causes fluid-filled cysts to grow in the kidneys, so they expand in size. Surgeons have removed the kidneys, which weighed as much as a newborn baby, from a 45-year-old man with a genetic disease. Scan shows the kidneys, which had grown to 20 times their normal size . Incredibly, a week after his initial operation at Delhi's Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, a second kidney weighing 5.5lbs (2.5kg) was removed. Both kidneys beat the previous record of 4.7lbs (2.1kg), which was removed in Dhule, India, in 2011, according to Guinness World Records. Normally, healthy kidneys weigh between 125g and 170g in men - less than half a pound. The patient was diagnosed with ADPKD, which is potentially lethal, last year. He arrived at the hospital suffering from high fever, blood in his urine and severe abdominal pain before he was admitted. 'I used to remain tired throughout the day due to excessive blood loss,' the patient, whose name has not been released by the hospital, said. It took a team of surgeons three hours to remove the giant organ, before he was then put on dialysis. He will soon receive a kidney transplant. Dr Bhargav, one of the surgeons who carried out the procedure, said: 'The kidney was 20 times the normal size and was stuck around the intestines. Normal healthy kidneys weight between\u00a0125g and 170g in men - less than half a pound. One of the kidneys the doctors removed weighed 6lbs (2.7kg) (is is pictured on the scales) 'The patient is recovering and awaiting a kidney transplant.' ADPKD affects between 1 in 700-1,000 individuals worldwide, with 12.5 million cases globally, and is currently incurable. It is caused by mutations in one or more genes, causing them to function abnormally. Cysts develop in the kidneys, and often the livers and the pancreas. Over time, they grow and multiple, replacing normal healthy tissue and causing the kidneys to stop working. In the early stages, there may be no symptoms and the cysts won't be noticed until adulthood. They will vary by individual but may include back or abdominal pain, recurrent urinary infections or blood in the urine, kidney stones and kidney failure. Two thirds of adults with ADPKD will develop high blood pressure, and 1 in 12 will develop small brain aneurysms. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is an inherited condition that causes small, fluid-filled sacs called cysts to develop in the kidneys. Although children are born with the condition, ADPKD does not usually cause any noticeable problems until the cysts grow large enough to affect the kidneys' functions. In most cases, this doesn't occur until 30-60 years of age. When ADPKD reaches this stage, it can cause a wide range of problems, including abdominal pain, high blood pressure, blood in the urine, urine infections and kidney stones. Eventually, kidney function gets worse and worse, until so much is lost that kidney failure develops. ADPKD affects between 1 in 700-1,000 individuals worldwide, with 12.5 million cases globally, and is currently incurable. It is caused by mutations in one or more genes, causing them to function abnormally. Sources: NHS Choices and Polycystic Kidney Charity .",

        "article": "Manchester City have not won a Premier League game having been behind at half-time in almost 20 years. The shocking stat is revealed as City's title hopes lay in tatters following Monday night's 2-1 defeat at Crystal Palace which Manuel Pellegrini's side trailed at the interval. The last time City managed to win having been in a losing position at half-time was on April 17, 1995 when they beat Blackburn Rovers 3-2 having been 2-1 down at the break. Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany and Joe Hart trudge off the field after losing to Crystal Palace . Man City have not managed to win a Premier League fixture having trailed at half-time in almost 20 years . Man City boss Manuel Pellegrini looks to the floor at Selhurst Park as his side's title dreams lay in tatters . While City have spent five seasons out of the top-flight since the 1994-95 campaign - which Rovers went on to win - the stat still makes for incredible reading as the blue side of Manchester look to retain their Premier League crown and claim their third title in four seasons. City's goalscorers that day were defender Keith Curle, now manager of League 2 strugglers Carlisle, from the penalty spot,  former Brentford boss Uwe Rosler and Paul Walsh. City went on to finish the Premier League season in 17th, two places above the drop zone. Blackburn: Flowers, Kenna, Berg, Pearce, Hendry, Le Saux, Sherwood, Atkins (Batty, 78), Ripley, Sutton, Shearer. Scorers: Shearer, 7, Hendry, 39. Booked: Sutton, Atkins. Manchester City: Coton, Edghill, Foster, Curle, Kernaghan, Summerbee, Flitcroft, Simpson, Rosler, Walsh (Beagrie, 78), Quinn. Scorers: Curle (pen), 32, Rosler, 57, Walsh 71.

Uwe Rosler (left) celebrates equalising against Blackburn as Man City staged a comeback at Ewood Park . Alan Shearer celebrates for the eventual Premier League winners after scoring the opener on seven minutes . While City have not won having trailed at the interval in almost two decades, all of City's top six rivals have managed to overturn half-time deficits in the last five years. Spurs came from behind to beat Hull in November 2014, Manchester United and Chelsea claimed victory after trailing at half-time last season. Liverpool beat Aston Villa after losing 1-0 at the interval against Aston Villa in March 2013 while Arsenal came from 2-1 down to beat Chelsea 5-3 in October 2011. To make matters worse, it seems Manuel Pellegrini's men are in need of some new blood. City had the second oldest starting XI in the Premier League this weekend with an average age of 29 years and 345 days; only West Brom fielded an older side, during their 4-1 home defeat to QPR. Sergio Aguero, Vincent Kompany and goalkeeper Joe Hart were the only starters against Palace aged 28 or under. Arsenal \u2013 29/10/11 \u2013 2-1 down at Chelsea at HT, won 5-3 .

        "article": "This is the university equality officer at the centre of a sexism and racism row pictured in front of a 'no white men' sign showing  their tears dripping into a cup. A picture of Bahar Mustafa, 27, student union Welfare and Diversity Officer at Goldsmiths University in London, pretending to cry was posted online  as she was being accused of discrimination. The handmade poster also refers to a ban on 'cis' or cisgender men, a term used of those whose mental gender and physical sex match, which is the opposite of transgender. Message: This picture of Bahar Mustafa, the student union Welfare and Diversity Officer at Goldsmiths University, shows her posing in front if a 'no white men' sign while pretending to cry . Row: Ms Mustafa appeared to ban men and white people from attending the meeting in this Facebook post . The photograph first appeared on Miss Mustafa's Facebook profile on Tuesday, six days after she told white people and men 'not to come' to a meeting she was organising to discuss 'diversifying the curriculum'. She wrote on Facebook last week: \u2018Invite loads of BME [black and minority ethnic] Women and non-binary people!! Also, if you\u2019ve been invited and you\u2019re a man and/or white PLEASE DON\u2019T COME just cos i invited a bunch of people and hope you will be responsible enough to respect this is a BME Women and non-binary event only.\u2019 Non-binary is a term used to describe people who do not consider themselves exclusively male or female. Miss Mustafa, 27, added: \u2018Don\u2019t worry lads we will give you and allies things to do\u2019, followed by a wink. The event\u2019s online page said it was open to \u2018self-defining BLACK and ETHNIC MINORITY women and non-binary people with gender identities that include \u201cwoman\u201d.\u2019 A notice about the meeting later appeared to show the ban had been dropped, stating: 'Allies now welcome!' Miss Mustafa, pictured at a demonstration, describes herself as a \u2018queer, anti-racist feminist killjoy\u2019 and previously organised a 'BME ONLY social\u2019 before showing the film Dear White People . The post was met with outrage by students of the university, one of whom described the exclusive policy as 'patronising beyond belief'.\u00a0The story was covered by student newspaper The Tab just hours after Miss Mustafa first posted the image. Goldsmiths' union eventually backed down after a backlash from students. The ban on men and white students is surprising, since the organisers claim to promote \u2018zero tolerance\u2019 for \u2018all forms of prejudice, discrimination and oppression\u2019. A senior union member told student newspaper The Tab that Miss Mustafa\u2019s actions had made it \u2018very difficult\u2019 for male students. In the hours after the story made national news yesterday, a friend of Miss Mustafa again posted the picture of her pretending to cry to Facebook. He wrote: 'When you thought the cup in the picture was big enough for white tears'. In February, Miss Mustafa, whose Twitter biography says she is \u2018queer, anti-racist feminist killjoy\u2019, also organised a 'BME ONLY social\u2019 before showing the film Dear White People. Today her friends posted supportive messages on her Facebook page and also offered her a place to stay if she needed it. But not everyone was so supportive. One Facebook friend, called Jessie, wrote: 'You do not speak for me. I voted you into the position of Welfare and Diversity Officer. 'Your passion is inspiring. But I can't defend this. We cannot best \"them\" by being them. We cannot demand to be included by excluding. 'To specifically exclude a group of people from any event is to become the oppressor. As the oppressed, we should not wish to inflict upon others that pain which we know to be harmful to us. 'This is not the Goldsmiths I love'. Bahar Mustafa, student union Welfare and Diversity Officer at Goldsmiths University in London, sparked anger when she banned men and white people from a 'diversity' meeting . Graduate: Miss Mustafa recently completed an MA in gender and media studies and won election to become the union's\u00a0Welfare and Diversity Officer . Miss Mustafa recently graduated from Goldsmiths with an MA in gender and media studies. Criticism: Critics have said that Miss Mustafa\u2019s actions had made it \u2018very difficult\u2019 for male students but friends have also defended her . She is understood to live with her mother Nursen, 55, father Ismail, 57, and sister Ipek, 23, in Enfield in a \u00a3450,000 three-bedroom terrace. The Daily Mail tried to contact Miss Mustafa but she was not available to explain the comments apparently posted from her Facebook account. A friend told MailOnline  she 'does not want to talk to you'. Yesterday a spokesman for Goldsmiths said the university had no part in the decisions of the union, adding: \u2018We are proud of our diverse community and do not tolerate any form of oppression, including racism, sexism or any other form of bigotry. \u2018We have written to the students\u2019 union to express our concern.\u2019 The union said: \u2018Goldsmiths Students\u2019 Union places huge importance on equality and diversity. \u2018It is in this vein that we host spaces where specific minority groups who experience similar discrimination can talk together confidently about overcoming the structural disadvantages and prejudice they face. \u2018The accusation that we discriminate is one we refute wholeheartedly'. Goldsmiths has insisted the Student Union is a separate organisation over which it has no control .",

Belfast-born Iain Watters had to leave the show after he binned his baked Alaska after the ice cream was left out of the freezer and it melted. But now he's back with his modern take on traditional fruity Easter  fare - a Simnel cake. Scroll down for video . Former Great British Bake Off contestant, Iain Watters, is back to revive Easter classic, the Simnel cake . Packed with moist fruit and marzipan, Simnel cake has been enjoyed since the Medieval times during Easter. Topped with 12 balls of marzipan to celebrate the 12 apostles, the cake already has a distinctive appearance but Iain has taken that even further by dying it green. Working alongside shopping website ao.com, Iain offers up a modern update on the fruit-based cake, with the twist of pistachios, figs and nutmeg seasoning. The Simnel cake took a backseat for years, replaced by other classics such as hot cross buns - until this Easter. Perhaps the trendy construction engineer can convince a new generation of bakers to attempt this hearty cake. The Belfast-baker puts a modern twist on the Easter favourite with pistachios, nutmeg and chopped figs . Instead of almond marzipan, Watters' modern update has pistachio marzipan, and the cake is decorated with orange zest and edible rose petals . The Irish baker opts for a pistachio-based marzipan, and flavours the sponge with orange zest, chopped figs and nutmeg. The recipe was created by Iain after it was revealed by ao.com that the Simnel cake was enjoying a resurgence this Easter. A survey by the shopping website also revealed that 58 per cent of the population would be indulging in home baking to celebrate Easter. For the cake: . For the pistachio marzipan: . Method: . 1. For marzipan, finely grind the pistachios in a food processor. Add the icing sugar and grind to a really fine mixture, then tip into a mixing bowl. Lightly whisk 1 egg white with a fork and stir in. Using your hand, knead the mixture until smooth. You may not need all the egg white take care as it can become too wet very quickly . 2. Wrap in cling film and allow to rest in the fridge while you are making the cake . 3. Heat the oven to 170\u00b0C/325\u00b0F/Gas mark 3, and grease and line a 22mm round, deep cake tin . 4. Prepare the figs by chopping then into large pea sizes and set aside . 5. Sift the self-raising flour and finely grate the nutmeg and set aside . 6. Beat the margarine and sugar until light and fluffy; you can use a wooden spoon or an electric whisk or mixer. Then add all the eggs including egg yolk, along with the sifted flour and grated nutmeg and beat until well combined . 7. Now fold in the fig until thoroughly dispersed . 8. Pour the mixture into the prepare cake tin and bake for 35-40mins. Inserted skewer in to the center of the cake if it comes out clean it\u2019s done . 9. Leave to cool on a wire rack then remove from the tin and discard the lining paper . 10. Trim the top of the cake so you have a flat top for the marzipan to sit on . 11. Roll out two-thirds of the pistachio marzipan to a circle to fit the top of the cake. I rolled out the marzipan and used the base of the cake as a template and cut around it to form a perfectly sized disc Brush the top of the cake with a little warm apricot jam or honey and set the marzipan disc on top . 12. Shape the rest of the marzipan into 12 balls and arrange around the edge, again stick them on with a little warm apricot jam or honey . 13. Finally to decorate I sprinkling a few crush pistachios, zest of an orange and lemon, followed by some edible rose petals .",

        "article": "Evidence has emerged of a wartime blunder that resulted in millions of pounds of Russian bullion, supposedly bound for America, being lost in the river Clyde. The gold and silver bars had been loaded in Murmansk onto a former Irish Sea ferry, converted into a battle cruiser with her superstructure stripped to take part in a dangerous Arctic convoy. The bullion was to pay the Americans for arms shipped to Russia during one of the most crucial stages of the Second World War. Scroll down for video . The bullion was loaded onto the HMS Ulster Queen (pictured) in 1942 and was being transferred to the U.S. as payment for weapons when the case of precious metals was lost overboard . The former ferry, HMS Ulster Queen, arrived in Greenock in November 1942, after 13 days at sea and two ships sunk by German U-boats. But as a delicate operation began to transfer the cases of treasure onto a waiting boat, one slipped and fell into the muddy waters. Such a veil of secrecy existed over the whole operation it is not known if it was ever recovered. In fact, the incident has only come to light thanks to a secret diary kept by one of the Ulster Queen's engineers, and now revealed by his daughter for the first time in a new book. Edinburgh man Leonard H. Thomas served on the Ulster Queen on four convoys to and from Murmansk and Archangel in Russia's extreme northwest. Mr Thomas had got into the habit of keeping copious notes and sketches during his pre-war role as a crewman on the research ship RRS Discovery II in the Southern Ocean. He had joined the Discovery as a 17-year-old in his native Portsmouth. He continued his writings on the Convoys - but aware that should any of his diaries be discovered he would be in serious trouble, he wrote in code and secreted them well. Before he died in 2000, aged 88, he transcribed some of them into four A4 journals, which his daughter, Leona Thomas, has now edited into a book. Edinburgh man Leonard H. Thomas served on the Ulster Queen on four convoys to and from Russia's extreme northwest . Leona, 61, a retired school teacher, said yesterday: 'The story about the Russian bullion is fascinating. It must be documented somewhere, but I have never been able to find out what happened afterwards.' According to her father's notes, there had been 'a peculiar silence all through the ship' as she was loaded in Russia. No one was allowed on deck, no one was allowed along the alleyways forward of the engine room, and no one off the mess decks unless they were on watch. Mr Thomas recorded: 'No scuttles [were] allowed to be opened, but someone got a gleek out and saw mighty big steam locomotives smothered in soldiers, up and down the cleared area of the track, hundreds of them, all with rifles and many with Tommy guns. 'Our guards lined the deck, we later heard, either side of a small derrick which handled the paravanes [mine detectors]. A huge, dark wagon was coaxed, nudged, and jogged until the derrick's fall was hanging vertically and a rope net was placed on the ground. 'Officers approached the wagon and examined locks and bolts [with] armed troops literally surrounding it. Then began the laborious manual exercise of [unloading] what looked like ammunition boxes, which required two men to lift. 'Surely this wasn't small arms ammunition! Not with our own guards and hundreds of troops watching it loaded into us. It certainly was not. It was bullion! 'Two boxes were enough to load the sling and up they went, deposited on our deck, from where each one was slid and lowered down into the 'B Gun' magazine, never out of sight of at least one officer. 'This was the arrangement so that the millions could be spent in the USA to arm the Russians.' 'Then into the Wardroom [went the] harassed officials, who, we heard, lashed into the whisky \"as if it were free.\" Probably, with all that off their hands, they could afford to.' Once back in the Clyde, after 'a fast run down the Minches', calamity was to come, however. Mr Thomas wrote: 'It was very late when we saw the welcoming but shaded lights of the Boom Control vessels, hauling left and right to usher us through the widening but regulated aperture, and suddenly the serenity of approaching a hallowed anchorage and being met by a small but important armada and a lighter. 'For the next hour it was cloak-and-dagger stuff again, no one allowed on the upper deck forward of the Wardroom or on the working alleyways. We heard that troops and all sorts were organised to receive the bullion from where it had been man-handled onto the upper deck. 'The paravane derrick was reeved [threaded] and a wire was taken with snatch blocks to a winch. The first two boxes were slung with a hemp rope-sling. Mr Thomas, who died in 2000 aged 88, pictured with his late wife Louie in 1996 . 'In the shaded lights were many officials, officers, men in good suits, bayonets, torches, clipboards, tarpaulins, surreptitious smokers, but nary an onlooker. 'Our Captain anxiously peered over the port wing of the bridge, his nose barely over the canvas dodger, to observe the last rites of the Russian bullion. 'And then it happened. The first boxes, two in number, were being hauled toward the lighter, and who knows what happened, but one slipped and fell with a resounding thump and a splash into the Clyde. 'I was told on good authority that it was nothing so much as resembling a H. M. Bateman cartoon. Needless to say, all were to blame according to what was imparted as a result of this shocking affair. 'The rest was capably transferred to a lighter, various bits of paper signed, exchanged, and pocketed, and a tug chuffed up to pull the lighter clear.' Written in the diaries left for his daughter, Mr Thomas said: 'I was thankful to keep all these years, the actual daily scroll of some of the harrowing times I found myself in, especially the runs in the arctic waters so fraught with danger, both man-made and that of nature.' Leona said of the gold: 'Who knows, it may still be there.' Mr Thomas wrote in his diary how the crew of the Ulster Queen had hoped their ship would be chosen to steam straight for America, so they could 'live it up' for a few days before returning to war-torn Europe. In the end, the decision was apparently made to off-load the cargo in the Clyde, for eventual transfer to another vessel for the Atlantic crossing.

She will then have six months to apply for a marriage visa, which, if successful, will set her on the path to citizenship. Ms Carney, formerly known as Robert, said she has been dreaming of a life in Britain since reading books about it as a child. She added that she feels the nation is more accepting of 'people like her'. But it was only after meeting Anne in an online support group that she decided to make a move to the country she 'has always wanted to call home'. She said: '[Anne] told me months ago that my life would be more comfortable in England, not only because my heart has always been there, but overall Britain is more openly accepting of people like me. 'I cannot wait to be there with her and in a country I have always wanted to call home. 'In my heart, that's always been my home since I could read. I have dreamed of being a British citizen my whole life. 'I have found throughout life that British people are kind and polite. I have several friends I have made over the years and they really are some of the best friends anyone could ask for. 'I have spoken with many people about my upcoming move and they all say that my life would be less complicated and acceptance is found more easily there. 'I cannot speak for more people than I know, but in comparing friends from here in the US to my friends in the UK, my British friends are the most wonderful, caring, loving and accepting people I know.' Moving to Britain: Ms Carney, pictured, will undergo surgery to complete her gender transition before moving to live with her fiancee, identified only as Anne, in Plymouth, Devon, later this year . Ms Carney intends to move to the UK and search for a job before applying for a visa. She said:\u00a0'Immigration is a huge concern of mine. What I need to do is get there, settle in, find employment, then follow all proper channels to eventually earn myself a British citizenship. 'Once acclimatised, I will proudly hold my head high and call myself British, but not until I have earned that right. 'When I come home to England, I want it to be for the remainder of my life. 'There are so many reasons people migrate; personally I just want a better life. I am prepared for what may come my way on the road to becoming a permanent British citizen.'",

        "article": "A New York woman has worn the same ensemble to work every day for three years. Matilda Kahl, an art director at Saatchi & Saatchi, wears the exact same \u2018uniform\u2019 \u2013 an outfit made up of black trousers, white shirt and a custom leather rosette \u2013 every single day because, as she explains to DailyMail.com: 'When at work, I want to be judged on my work and my work only.' In an article for\u00a0Harper's Bazaar, Matilda explained that the unique sartorial idea came to her after a particularly stressful morning when, with 'a fairly important meeting on the horizon' she began trying on a variety outfits to no satisfaction. Scroll down for video . Empowering:\u00a0Saatchi & Saatchi art director Matilda Kahl has got everyone talking about her everyday work 'uniform' 'I'm given complete freedom over what I wear to the office, but that still left me questioning each piece that I added or subtracted from my outfit,' she wrote. '[I kept thinking], \"Is this too formal? Is that too out there? Is this dress too short?\" I finally chose something I regretted as soon as I hit the subway platform.' Arriving at her meeting late, frazzled and wearing an inside-out sweater, while her male colleagues and new boss\u00a0looked relaxed and at-ease, left her feeling frustrated and wondering why she'd bothered with the stress of it at all. 'I knew my male colleagues were taken seriously no matter what they wore - and I highly doubted they put in as much sartorial time and effort as I had,' she writes. 'But gender issues aside, I needed to come up with a solution to simplify this morning struggle.' Vowing to never let herself feel that way again, Matilda made the decision to make the same simple, easy wardrobe choices as many of her male colleagues did, wearing the same outfit each and every day, thereby eliminating the seemingly endless struggle to determine what to wear. Simple, yet effective: Matilda achieved her look by buying blouses in bulk and pairing them only with black trousers . She found her sartorial salvation in the form of 15 identical white silk blouses and several pairs of simple black trousers. For a 'personal touch' she added a custom-made leather rosette in homage to her mother, who used to love putting bows in her hair. She also throws on a black blazer for the chillier days. 'I\u2019ve always thought black and white looks stylish, so it was a pretty easy decision on the color,' she explains to Daily Mail Online, adding that she took her time deciding on the exact designs. 'I finally fell for the white shirt for its diagonal button line and the cuts in the sleeves. 'New York gets really hot in the summer, so as an alternative to the 6 pants I bought 2 matte black skirts. Simple and sweet.' With her identical every day look, Matilda is following in the footsteps of many high-powered individuals, from Steve Jobs to Mark Zuckerberg - who says he owns 20 identical grey t-shirts for work. All tied up: Matilda tops off her look with a simple black leather bow, which she calls her 'personal touch' inspired by her mother's affinity for bows in her hair . But despite many people trying out the trend before her, Matilda admitted that she faced 'mixed reactions' to her new uniform idea from her co-workers. She was asked if she had lost a bet, joined a cult and some even assumed she was too destitute to afford other work clothing. But when confronted with endless questions about her new look, she shot back with: 'Have you ever set up a bill for online auto-pay? Did it feel good to have one less thing to deal with every month?' Many critics also wonder: why doesn't she just choose her outfit the night before? 'To me, that would only move the problem to another time of day, not really solving it,' she says. 'It would just make me go to bed later and lose valuable sleep. 'Nor would it solve the pressure of constantly feeling that I have to express my creative ability through my way of dressing, which is something I feel relieved from now with the uniform.' According to Matilda, the criticism has done nothing but reassure her of her choices.\u00a0'People have really put it to the test, and I\u2019m happy to say the more questions I get the more sure I become of that I\u2019m happy with my choice of wearing a uniform,' she explains. All in all, Matilda is immensely pleased with her decision, saying it has saved her huge amounts of money\u2013 and also removed a source of stress from her life completely. She also claims it has given her a new sense of control. Coming up to three years in her look, Matilda doesn't see herself stopping anytime soon - but insists that if the mood strikes her, she could go back to planning her daily wardrobe. 'I still feel like it does a good job for me so I see no reason for stopping wearing the uniform,' she says. 'But if I would wake up one day and feel like start spending time on picking out an outfit every morning, I\u2019d no problem with giving it up. The uniform is here for me, I\u2019m not here for the uniform.' She does however admit that she has had to re-stock her collection of white shirts - because the 15 that she bought originally have become so worn out that she is no longer able to wear them. 'They are all exactly the same and have been for almost three years, up until a week ago,' she added to Harper's Bazaar. 'The shirts had gotten worn out, others stained....So last weekend I spent two days on a rather intense hunt for a new hero shirt. I finally found it at Zara.'",

        "article": "Unless you're born with Kate Moss' cheekbones or Karlie Kloss' endless legs, making it as a model in the fast-paced and fickle world of fashion is no mean feat - and something Liris Crosse knows all about. For Liris, 32, who is now dubbed The Body and The Naomi Campbell of the plus-size modelling world, certainly came from humble beginnings. When starting out, her statuesque form, cat-like eyes, full lips and flawless complexion got Liris in the door of most model agencies, but she admits her voluptuous shape landed her on the shelf. Scroll down for video . Liris Crosse always dreamed of being a model but had a tough time breaking into the industry with many people telling her to lose weight to succeed - but the size 18 model (US 14) proved them wrong . Liris, who grew up in Baltimore, Maryland, shares her candid journey to the top with FEMAIL, how she proved her doubters wrong and how she's hoping to take the UK by storm. 'I can recall studying all the major fashion magazines as a little girl so I could see Tyra Banks and my model idol, Naomi Campbell,' she said of her earliest fashion memories. 'I watched fashion TV for all the runway shows and obsessed over Naomi Campbell's runway walk. 'I still idolise her poise, body and skin to this day and I practiced in my mother's heels back and forth in the kitchen. I'm honored that the plus fashion world calls me the \"Naomi of Plus\" because she's taught me from afar unknowingly.' Liris, 32,  is now dubbed The Body and The Naomi Campbell of plus - but it wasn't always so simple . Liris' model idol has always been Naomi Campbell, right, who she 'obsessed over' as a young girl and is now compared to by industry bigwigs . When she was starting out, despite being a healthy size 10 (US 6), Liris received rejection after rejection due to her voluptuous shape, but now she stars in regular fashion shoots, pictured . In her junior year of high school, she heard about a casting call in her area for a convention called Model Search America and immediately signed up. She was lucky enough to get callbacks from Zoli Models, Elite Models NY, Michelle Pommier and Seventeen Magazine - but there was a catch. 'They all loved me but wanted me to lose weight,' she said. Despite being a healthy size 10 (US 6), Liris received rejection after rejection due to her voluptuous shape. And even though she chose an east coast giant, Wilhelmina Models, as her mother agency, casting reps still requested that she first lose weight and then come back in six months. Liris has also starred in top videos with Jennifer Lopez, Jay Z and Puff Daddy . Liris is breaking into the UK and appeared in a recent campaign for Sir Philip Green's Evans, and starred in the Goddess Lingerie line through the Eveden brand . Instead of giving into their demands or giving up on what she believed was her calling, Liris, who is 5ft 11in, and now size 18 (US 14), took matters into her own hands and created the vision for them. She became her own agent and utilised the urban market to achieve her dreams with the help of her agency. Liris began to spread like wildfire. Essence, Honey, XXL, The Source and Black Elegance magazines were the first to believe in her vision. With these successes, Glamour, Seventeen and Girl soon caught onto her refreshing image and began requesting Liris for their glossy pages. She booked top videos for the likes of Jennifer Lopez,  Jay Z, Puff Daddy, starred on MTV and landed  film roles. Liris says she wants to change the industry by inspiring women to follow their dreams, helping to represent a different body type other than straight size in mainstream fashion . And now she's starting to break the UK. Liris appeared in a recent campaign for Sir Philip Green's plus-size fashion retailer, Evans, who fell in love with her when she took her runway reign to British Plus Size Fashion Weekend 2014. She has also starred in the Goddess Lingerie line through the Eveden brand. 'I would love to work more in the UK with Evans, Anna Scholz, Yours Clothing, Panache, Elomi, ASOS, Simple Be, Dorothy Perkins, Carma Koma to name a few,' she said. 'I want to continue to change the industry by inspiring women to follow their dreams, helping to represent a different body type other than straight size in mainstream fashion like I have done through my work and to also represent for the black plus woman who feels she doesn't see herself in mainstream fashion and entertainment.' 'I also want to get back more into my acting career because I truly believe a plus woman can be a sexy lead on a TV series... Hey Hollywood, call me! Liris has starred on the glossy covers of plus-size magazines in her time .",

        "article": "At a quick glance, Robert Mugabe appeared to be sporting a new hairstyle and even a pair of earrings when he arrived into South Africa for a state visit today. However, upon closer inspection, it was apparent that the photograph emerged after a bit of camera trickery, and the longer hairdo and dangly earrings did in fact belong to a woman stood directly behind him. The comical image emerged amid claims the president of Zimbabwe is lining up his 24-year-old daughter to succeed him. Scroll down for video . At a glance, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe appeared to be sporting a new hairstyle and even a pair of earrings when he arrived into South Africa for a state visit today, but it was in fact just a cleverly taken shot . It is not the first time an amusing image of the 91-year-old dictator has surfaced, with one of him falling down podium steps becoming an internet sensation earlier this year. The photo, which showed the president taking a tumble after addressing supporters at Harare Airport, was turned into numerous memes showing him in imagined circumstances, such as part of Beyonce's Single Ladies choreography, surfing or running from security forces. However, Mugabe failed to see the funny side and reportedly had no fewer than 27 bodyguards suspended for failing to stop his embarrassing fall. Mugabe arrived into Pretoria, South Africa today for a three-day state visit to the country amid ongoing speculation that his daughter will assume the position of president after him. He had originally planned for his wife Grace to replace him but, due to her deteriorating health, Mugabe is now said to be keen for his daughter Bona to step up. Last year, Mugabe promoted his wife to a senior position within his ruling ZANU-PF party where she led a vicious campaign to remove former vice-president Joice Mujuru from office. Mujuru was long considered a likely successor to Mugabe but she fell out with the veteran leader late last year and was sacked as vice-president in December. It is not the first time an amusing image of the 91-year-old dictator has emerged, with one of him falling down podium steps outside Zimbabwe's Harare Airport (pictured) becoming an internet sensation earlier this year . The photograph, which showed the president taking a fall, was turned into numerous memes, including one which super-imposed him onto Kim Kardashian's iconic 'Break the Internet' cover for Paper Magazine . Other memes which quickly circulated online showed Mugabe taking part in Athletics alongside Usain Bolt . Mugabe reportedly had no fewer than 27 bodyguards suspended for failing to stop his embarrassing fall . Last week, the ruling ZANU-PF party expelled Mujuru altogether for allegedly plotting against the president. The 59-year-old was accused of 'plotting to unconstitutionally remove President Robert Mugabe from office', according to a statement from Simon Khaya-Moyo, spokesman for the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front. She was also accused of 'orchestrating factionalism in the party thereby causing acrimonious divisions' and 'engaging in activities that smack of corruption'. Her allies in government were also fired and expelled from ZANU-PF after Mugabe himself accused her of plotting to oust him. It left experts believing his wife may follow in his footsteps but the 49-year-old has fallen severely ill in recent months and has been taking regular trips to Singapore for medical treatment. In her absence, his daughter Bona has now taken a more prominent role at the Zimbabwean president's side at official events and trips. It is claimed that president Robert Mugabe (centre) wants his 24-year-old daughter Bona (left) to succeed him . Last month, photographs emerged showing her with Mugabe - who is also in poor health - as part of a state delegation that held talks with Japan's prime minister. The move sparked furious criticism from opposition parties and political analysts but a ZANU-PF spokesman insisted the move was not politically motivated. In an interview with Nehanda Radio, Psychology Mazivisa said: 'Madam Bona Mugabe has not done anything nearly as much. 'We refuse to buy into the narrative that for as long as it's President Mugabe doing it, no matter how perfectly lawful it is, it's wrong... It's a barbaric way of doing politics.' But a spokesman for the opposition MDC party said it clearly showed 'that the state has been virtually privatised by the Mugabe dynasty'.",

        "article": "(CNN)Back in 1989, Ayatollah Khomeini famously said he was \"drinking poison\" when he accepted a ceasefire to end the eight-year-old war with Iraq.  The war had helped define Khomeini's regime, the Islamic Republic, which he had founded a year before Saddam Hussein invaded Iran. Khomeini galvanized the nation, both his supporters and growing opponents, to fight against the enemy. He dragged out the war for eight years, despite Saddam's willingness to accept a ceasefire, and thus stabilized the foundations of the Islamic Republic. By the time he ended the war, the economy was in shambles, and there was no sign of his die-hard volunteers. Since then, \"drinking a chalice of poison\" has became part of Iranian political lexicon, and many analysts have asked whether Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Khomeini's successor, would raise the chalice and surrender to demands by the West to end Iran's nuclear program. Like the war, Iran's defiance to halt its controversial nuclear program has defined Khameni's era. He has defied the West in the face of increasing economic pressure. Iran claims that its program is peaceful, but Khamenei's refusal to end uranium enrichment activities -- a process that can lead to making nuclear fuel as well as nuclear bombs -- has landed the country under crippling sanctions. The standoff with the West has stretched longer than the war. The agreement reached in Lausanne, Switzerland, however, marks a new chapter in the history of the country. If Iran can finalize a deal by June with the United States and its P5+1 partners, international investors, including Americans, would be able to invest in Iran for the first time in decades. Iran can develop its gas and oil fields, and the economy can leap forward. Desperate for a deal, whoever I called over the past week inside Iran was glued to their television sets, and tens of thousands poured out on the streets to celebrate the agreement late Thursday night. Iran's economy shrank after sanctions were intensified in 2012 and the value of the Rial, the Iranian currency, plunged to one-third of the U.S. dollar. Inflation soared and the bank accounts of ordinary Iranians were frozen overseas as a result of sanctions. Millions of Iranians are hoping that their lives will improve in the post-deal era. Despite the regime's propaganda that claimed the program enjoys wide support among people, critics inside the country publicly denounced nuclear policies. Ahmad Shirzad, a former member of parliament, denounced the program last year and said it had been \"against national interests.\" Another critic, Sadeq Ziba, said in December \"the nuclear program has hurt the country more than the war.\" Iranian politicians are divided between moderates -- led by President Hassan Rouhani, who wants to develop the economy -- and hardliners, who view the deal as a threat to the regime's ideology. The majority of people brought Rouhani to power in 2012, hoping that he would ease the sanctions. Many see the negotiations as a diplomatic necessity that would help sideline hardliners too. Yet the Lausanne agreement would not have been possible without the moderates' will and Khamenei's approval. Ayatollah Khamenei is 76. Last year, he underwent a long prostate surgery, which led to rumors that he might be gravely ill. His predecessor ended the war a year before his death. Whether Khamenei is seriously ill or not, many believe that because of his advanced age, he needs to put the country on a straight path before his death. So far, the regime has presented the deal as a win for itself. During 18 months of negotiations, the regime appeared determined not to succumb to Western demands and lose its right to uranium enrichment. The Lausanne agreement allows Iran to spin 5,000 centrifuges and avoid national humiliation. Khamenei can claim that Iran is the winner in the country's decade-long confrontation with the West -- a legacy that he wants to leave behind. He has not drunk the poison yet, not until June, when negotiators aim to iron out the final deal. But perhaps he has raised the chalice.",

        "article": "Technology that claims to transform any smartphone into a Star Trek-style tricorder is set to be unveiled in Israel. The company behind the device says it has the potential to break down the chemical components of almost any object from a distance. The technology could help a range of industries such as food and drink, healthcare and the defence sector, the researchers claim. Scroll down for video . Technology that claims to transform any smartphone into a Star Trek-style tricorder is set to be unveiled in Israel. The company behind the device says it has the potential to break down the chemical components of almost any object from a distance. The image shows how the picture might be used . Unispectral Technologies and Tel Aviv University, who are behind the system, say it works by analysing a materials 'hyperspectral signature', which is its unique chemical fingerprint. The team have already patented the optical part of the system, which is based on existing microelectromechanical or 'MEMS' technology. 'The optical element acts as a tunable filter and the software - an image fusion library - would support this new component and extract all the relevant information from the image,' said Professor David Mendlovic at Tel Aviv University. Hyperspectral imaging collects and processes information from across the electromagnetic spectrum. A Tricorder is a scanning device used by Starfleet personnel in the Star Trek universe. It was used largely by Mr Spock, the alien first officer of the Starship Enterprise . Once the camera take an image, the data would be further analysed by a third-party to extract the hyperspectral signature at any location in the image. Hyperspectral imaging collects and processes information from across the electromagnetic spectrum. For each pixel in an image, a hyperspectral camera acquires the light intensity for a large number of different spectral bands. This allows it to provide more detailed information about the scene than a normal color camera, which only acquires three different spectral bands. The imaging works in both video and still photography, he says. 'We are close to producing a prototype, which is scheduled for release in June,' said Professor Mendlovic. 'A long list of fields stand to gain from this new technology. 'We predict hyperspectral imaging will play a major role in consumer electronics, the automotive industry, biotechnology, and homeland security.' This back-end analyser would need a large database of hyperspectral signatures at its disposal. Applications of the sensor include remote health monitoring and industrial quality control. 'Agricultural applications may also benefit because hyperspectral imaging could be used to identify properties of crops, vegetables, and other types of foods,' Mr Raz says. 'Its hyperspectral platform is also suitable for wearable devices.' A first-generation demonstration system of the camera. \u00a0Once the camera take an image, the data would be further analysed by a third-party to extract the hyperspectral signature at any location in the image . According to Professor Mendlovic, Unispectral is currently in discussions with major smartphone makers, car companies, and wearable device makers to move the technology forward. A Tricorder is a scanning device used by Starfleet personnel in the Star Trek universe. There are two variations; a regular (engineering) Tricorder and a medical Tricorder. Medical Tricorders are used to wirelessly scan a patient, either in a \u2018sick bay\u2019 on a star ship or during an away mission. The scanning tool can determine a patient\u2019s medical status, and allows doctors to quickly and easily diagnose their condition without an intensive or invasion examination. And the company isn't the only one hoping to recreate Spock's Tricorder. Earlier this year, researchers revealed a gadget that can be used to diagnose an illness simply by holding it to the forehead. Named Scanadu Scout, the small round device is able to read a number of vital signs, including heart rate and temperature. It contains a variety of different sensors alongside a microphone on the top of the gadget that together, can read vital signs, including body temperature, heart rate, blood oxygen level, heart rate variability and pulse wave transit time (PWTT). PWTT is the time it takes for a heartbeat to reach somewhere else in a person's body and is related to blood pressure. Its makers claim the device is 99 per cent accurate in less than 10 seconds. Scanadu was finalist in the Qualcomm Tricorder X Prize, which was launched in 2013 to inspire a wireless device capable of detecting a range of diseases, including anaemia, tuberculosis and diabetes. Another device by London-based, ScanNurse, uses computer-vision techniques to analyse images taken with a camera. The scientists hope their system will make observations of the inside of the ears or throat, in the same way a doctor would, and then feed it into a computer for analysis. Other teams are using blood and urine samples to test for key markers. The tiny microfluidic devices will, they claim, work in a similar way to hospital-lab tests.",

        "article": "Wladimir Klitschko will match Joe Louis in boxing's record books with his 27th heavyweight title fight on Saturday and could set more marks since he has no plans to retire anytime soon. The 39-year-old Ukrainian, speaking to reporters ahead of Saturday's fight against American Bryant Jennings at New York's Madison Square Garden, has dominated the heavyweight division for nearly a decade and shown no signs of slowing down. 'As long as I have motivation and health, I'll do it. I don't feel old, or bad, or slow,' said Klitschko, who has 17 successful defenses in a row since winning the crown for the second time in 2006.

'What could be cooler, or better, than to be the best man on the planet and beating up people for a living?' The 6-foot-6 Ukrainian boasts a 63-3-0 record heading into the bout against Jennings, who is 19-0 since taking up boxing six years ago. But the 30-year-old challenger from Philadelphia is not impressed by Klitschko's accomplishments and plans on starting a new reign. 'My first edge is youth. Youth is always an edge that you can't deny. Speed. Speed is an edge. These are things that are obvious,' said Jennings. And Jennings wasn't alone in trying to bring the Ukrainian down. Maverick heavyweight Shannon Briggs made an appearance at the press conference and taunted Klitschko while taking his shirt off. Despite a three-inch height advantage in Klitschko's favor, Jennings enjoys the same edge in reach, which could help him keep the champion at bay with jabs. Youthful exuberance may go only so far against Klitschko though, who has shown himself a master technician during his long run.

'How long I've been champion, how many title defenses I've made ... I don't want to compare myself with any of the great heavyweights,' Klitschko, the 1996 Olympic champion said.

        "article": "It used to be as much a part of a Sunday routine as eating a roast dinner or reading the papers. But new figures show that the art of washing your own car appears to be dying out in Britain with a thrid of men admitting they have never picked up a bucket or chamois leather to clean their own motor. The study also reveals that three-quarters of women never wash their own car with drivers more likely to take it to a car wash on a local forecourt. A new study has revealed that a third of men have never picked up a bucket and a chamois leather to wash their own car (file pic) The survey of 1,100 adults by vehicle leasing firm OSV, found that 31 per cent of men have never washed their own car, with only 12 per cent of those that do saying they do it regularly. Meanwhile only five per cent of those surveyed said that had ever asked their children to wash the car, as a way for them to earn extra pocket money. Factors behind the decline vary from shops now opening on a Sunday and more live football on TV, meaning more people put off the chore at the weekend. The rise of hand car washes has been blamed for a decrease in drivers washing their own cars (file pic) Other reasons given for not washing cars include the rise of hand car washes and the fact that 4x4 and off-road vehicles are too large to clean. Brits are more likely to wash their own car during the holidays as the recent Easter break saw an estimated 15 million cars cleaned by their owners. However, one in four said they only did it as an excuse to get out of the house. Cars are most likely to be washed by their owners every week in Birmingham, Chelmsford and Sheffield and least likely in Oxford, Bath and Edinburgh. Audis, Toyotas and BMWs are most likely to be washed by their owners and Range Rovers, Peugeots and Mercedes least often. OSV spokesman Andrew Kirkley said: 'A lot of us remember seeing our streets full of men cleaning their cars every Sunday. It was a national tradition. 'But let's face it, we don't have as much time any more, the cars are bigger and even the kids don't seem to want to earn a bit of extra money doing it for us either. 'On top of that, there is now plenty of choice out there if you want to put the car through an automated machine or get a gang of enthusiastic guys to do it for you fairly cheaply.'",

Today David Cameron waded into the long-running dispute, and quickly got into a muddle about the Devon and Cornish way of eating a cream tea. The Prime Minister made the gaffe on a campaign visit to Devon, before risking the wrath of purists by claiming 'it all tastes the same'. Scroll down for video . David Cameron, on a visit to Devon this morning, made the blunder of confusing the two methods for eating a cream tea . How do you eat your scone? How do you eat your scone? Now share your opinion . The Tory leader has spent the day campaigning in Devon, where he must win several seats if he is to stand any chance of winning a majority. But his hopes of courting support in the county were given a knock with his food faux pas as he chatted with staff and customers of\u00a0Tea by the Taw on The Strand in Barnstaple, the North Devon Gazette reported. All good politicians know how to make small talk with voters, but the jam and cream debate is no trifling matter. In an attempt to woo the locals, Mr Cameron ventured: 'When you are in Devon you do the jam and the cream in a different order to Cornwall, is that right?' Sensing a gaffe was imminent, he went on: 'I'm going to get this wrong, aren't I?' His prediction was correct, as he added: 'In Devon it's... jam first and cream on top?' His comments were greeted with silence and stony faces, as the staff realised someone was going to have to put the Prime Minister right. 'Wrong way round. I knew I'd get it wrong,' Mr Cameron said. 'It all tastes the same, doesn't it?'. Wrangles over whether it should be jam first or cream, and whipped cream or clotted, have been running for generations, with references to the sweet treat dating back to the 11th century. The Devon tradition is to slather the scone with cream first, while the Cornish \u2013 who also lay claim to inventing cream teas \u2013 prepare their scones the opposite way. Two years ago, an academic devised what was claimed to be the mathematical formula for the perfect cream tea, and it used the Cornish way. Dr Eugenia Cheng, of Sheffield University, concluded that the best weight ratio is 2:1:1, which means an average scone, weighing 70g, requires 35g of jam and 35g of cream . The Tory leader has spent the day campaigning in Devon, where he must win several seats if he is to stand any chance of winning a majority . Academic Dr Eugenia Cheng, of Sheffield University, devised what was claimed to be the mathematical formula for the perfect cream tea, and it used the Cornish way. Dr Cheng set the ideal thickness of the scone, with all its elements added, at about 2.8cm, allowing a relaxed open width of the mouth when taking a bite. The equation also specifies the thickness of the cream and jam layers. Dr Cheng's formula is a victory for Cornwall, with jam spread first due to avoid it running off the edge. Another rule in the scientific method is to use clotted rather than whipped cream. This is due to the excessive volume of whipped cream needed to satisfy the weight ratio. The thickness of the layer should not exceed that of the scone.",

At a safe distance: The group cheer in excitment as Steven captures two orcas swimming and jumping from the water . The group on the boat cheer and yell in excitement at what they are witnessing as the whales appear to start moving closer to the boat. According to Steven, the group believe that the rope being pulled along the side of the boat is what attracted the pod to them, as its distinctive sound disturbed the whales. Commenting on their approach, one of the group can be heard saying: \u2018They\u2019re probably coming to check us out.\u2019 The group believe that the sound of the rope being pulled along the side of the boat is what attracted the orcas . One of the group states that the orca is probably coming to check them out before it emerges from the water and gives them all a fright . Before later adding: \u2018That is like 50 yards from us,\u2019 as the marine mammals continue to head in the direction of their boat. After suggesting that it might be a good idea to start rowing away, one of the group begins panicking and shouts: \u2018Guys we need to get out of here, it\u2019s coming right at us.\u2019 He then states: \u2018We need to sit down in the boat.

But this year's Cannes Film Festival has been declared a selfie-free zone after organisers asked celebrities to stop taking the\u00a0'ridiculous and grotesque' images. While Cannes director Thierry Fremaux admitted that he did not have the powers to ban the pictures altogether, he urged movie starts to resist the temptation. Scroll down for video . Celebrities have been told to stop taking selfies at this year's Cannes Film Festival by director Thierry Fremaux (pictured, models Petra Nemcova, left, and Victoria Bonya and Hofit Golan, right, at last year's event) Mr Fremaux said that the 'ridiculous and grotesque' pictures slowed the entire event down, causing problems for organisers (pictured, Jeremie Renier takes a selfie at the photocall for Saint Laurent last year) The Cannes director blasted celebrities such as Rosario Dawson (left) and\u00a0Nabilla Benattias (right) who 'stop every two metres to take a picture of themselves, with themselves' Quoted in the Guardian, he said: 'We don't want to prohibit it but it's really a matter of timing. 'We have a certain amount of time to get people across the red carpet and up the steps and it really slows things down if people stop every two metres to take a picture of themselves, with themselves.

Celebrities who will have to watch their selfie-taking at the 68th ceremony include Cate Blanchett, who stars in a film about lesbian love, and Michael Fassbender, who features in a film based on Shakespeare's MacBeth. Matthew McConaughey, Charlize Theron, Natalie Portman, Rachel Weisz and Benicio del Toro will also be welcomed to the French riviera when the event gets underway in a month's time. Mr Fremaux, director of Cannes, said he could not ban the pictures, but said celebrities will be discouraged from taking them .

French director Emmanuelle Bercot's drama 'La Tete Haute' (Head Held High), about a teenager steered away from a life of crime by a judge.

Geographically, the entries range from Europe to China, South Korea, the U.S. and Mexico, setting of Denis Villeneuve's narco-crime drama 'Sicario.'

        "article": "Swansea boss Garry Monk has responded to speculation linking him to the West Ham job by insisting the perfect man to manage the club is already in place at Upton Park. Sam Allardyce's current contract expires at the end of the season, and it has been suggested West Ham's owners might go in a different direction ahead of the club's move to the Olympic Stadium at the start of the 2016-17 campaign. Monk has been touted as a potential candidate after leading Swansea to a record-equalling 47 Barclays Premier League points with six games left, but the 36-year-old expressed his bemusement should the London club look elsewhere this summer. West Ham manager Sam Allardyce is out of contract at the end of the season and could leave the club . Garry Monk has been touted as a potential replacement but insists Allardyce is a perfect fit for West Ham . Allardyce has overseen a solid season in the league so far this term and the Hammers are ninth in the table . 'West Ham have a fantastic manager in place,' Monk said ahead of Swansea's trip to bottom-placed Leicester on Saturday. 'For them to be looking elsewhere - if they are - I think they've already got the manager there who's had a fantastic season. 'West Ham have done exceptionally well this season, progressed again, and that's what you want from a club.' Eighth-placed Swansea are four points better off than the Hammers, who have slipped to ninth after a wretched run of only two wins in their last 14 league games. Monk, the youngest manager in the Premier League, has also earned plaudits for the way Swansea have played this season and kept his side on track following the January sale of top scorer Wilfried Bony to Manchester City. 'I look at that type of speculation as a compliment to the way myself and the team have worked this season,' Monk said. Swansea have had to cope with the January sale of star player Wilfried Bony to Manchester City for \u00a328m . 'It shows we're progressing and going in the right direction. 'But West Ham is nothing to do with me. My focus is purely on Swansea and wishing to finish the season strong - and that will remain my focus. 'The points record was a target we talked about, we committed to the work we wanted to put in place and to achieve it. 'The players deserve massive credit but the whole thing is to get past it and we have six games to hopefully do that. 'We've just focussed on the next game, rather than positions, and that is the same this weekend . 'I'm surprised where Leicester are because of the quality they have, but they've put themselves in a good position to try to get out of it, so we've got to make sure our attitude and mentality is right.' Swansea's French forward Bafetimbi Gomis (left) has been sidelined for a month with a hamstring injury . Swansea must do without striker Bafetimbi Gomis for the next month as the France international will be sidelined by a hamstring injury picked up against Everton last weekend. Gomis had scored four goals in his last seven games and Monk admits the striker's loss has come at the wrong time. 'It's a blow because he's been very confident and showing why I brought him to the club,' Monk said. 'He's been a big player for us and it's disappointing because he was hitting a great bit of form, scoring goals and contributing to the team. 'I'm sure Bafe will come back fresh and he has the ability to really make a mark here, but it's a chance for someone else to step up and score some goals.'

        "article": "(CNN)Everybody loves a good comeback story -- especially one that's dino-sized. After its name was booted from science books for more than a century, a new study suggests that the Brontosaurus belongs to its own genera, and therefore deserves its own name. O.C. Marsh first named the Brontosaurus in 1879, after he received 25 crates of bones discovered at Como Bluff, Wyoming, according to the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History.  Similar to, though not as large as the Apatosaurus discovered a couple of years prior, Marsh named the dinosaur, \"Brontosaurus,\" or \"thunder lizard.\" Apatosaurus had three sacral vertebrae in its hip region and Brontosaurus had five, according to the museum's website, so Marsh gave the dinosaurs two different names.  Later it was discovered that the number of sacral vertebrae is related to age: as the animal gets older, two of the vertebrae fuse to the sacrum. Paleontologist Elmer Riggs concluded in 1903 that the Brontosaurus was really a young Apatosaurus, and therefore must go by that name, according to the museum. Emanuel Tschopp, a paleontologist at the Nova University of Lisbon, Portugal, led this latest study, which took five years and included visits to 20 museums in Europe and the United States to collect data. By examining \"500 anatomical traits,\" Tschopp said he was able to \"reconstruct the family tree\" of Diplodocids -- the family Apatosaurus and Brontosaurus belong to. Tschopp \"looked at every single specimen,\" according to Jacques Gauthier, curator of vertebrate paleontology at Yale Peabody Museum and \"noted their characteristics,\" plugging data into an algorithm that revealed \"five species in the group of Diplodocids.\"  Two of them are Brontosaurus-like and three are Apatosaurus-like, Gauthier said. While his findings have earned the excitement of Brontosaurus fans everywhere, Tschopp said he is \"expecting a debate about the case of Brontosaurus.\" \"We think we have good evidence,\" he said, \"But I know there are other research groups that do not completely agree.\" For Gauthier, Tschopp's discovery means changes are coming to the original Brontosaurus skeleton that has lived at the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History since 1936. \"We're definitely going to have to change the label,\" he said.",

The study, led by paleontologist Emanuel Tschopp, found that the Brontosaurus had five sacral vertebrae, unlike the Apatosaurus which had three, and that the number of sacral vertebrae is related to age."

Viewers unleashed a barrage of negative comments on Twitter after last night's episode of The Billion Dollar Chicken Shop on BBC One. The third programme in the series focused on the methods employed by the creative team behind KFC's rebranding exercise and showed scenes of a food stylist using hairdryers and tweezers when preparing the food for an advertisement. Scroll down for video . BBC One's The Billion Dollar Chicken Shop showed the inner workings of the fast food giant . This KFC ultimate burger (pictured) has not been styled by a food stylist . In the final episode, which aired yesterday, KFC is shown about to launch their new pulled chicken range which consists of a Twister, a mini wrap and the ultimate burger (pulled chicken piled on top of fried chicken pieces). Viewers\u00a0are \u00a0introduced to food stylist Dagmar who has to prepare the new products for photography. Using her arsenal of styling tools, which include a pair of nail scissors, tweezers and a mini hairdryer, she arranges pieces of pulled chicken, snips off errant bits of meat, and melts cheese using a hairdryer. Explaining the process, the brand's new marketing director Meghan, who has been employed to change the image of the fast food giant says: 'It's meant to look like it tastes really good. 'And this needs to look amazing enough so that they [the customers] want this instead of what they normally order.' KFC has a global turnover of 23 billion dollars a year, and a billion of that comes from the UK alone . Negative comments about the styling methods were soon trending on Twitter with viewer Miss Ay tweeting: No wonder fast food never actually looks like what's advertised.. It's been designed by a bladdy food stylist! (sic). Viewer Rachel K tweeted: 'I've just witnessed a chicken burger getting a cut and blow ready for a photo shoot.'

(sic) And there were others who expressed shock \u00a0that such a job existed. Neil Chetham tweeted: 'Who knew there was such a job as food stylist. What do they do five chicken fillets a short back and sides.' More critical comments came from Matthew Pill who said: 'As of KFC paid a food stylist to make this burger look like dog food.' A spokesperson from KFC said to FEMAIL: 'All of the food in our adverts is made using exactly the same ingredients we use in our restaurants and food stylists are there to ensure the food looks the best it can and all the ingredients can be clearly seen. 'When cooked in our restaurants our focus is delivering fresh, great tasting food fast, and so there may be some difference in how it looks - but the great taste remains.' Katy Young wondered how different her life would have turned out had she pursued a career in home economics . Hannah Tucker jokingly pointed out that the food stylist had 'missed a bit' Matthew Pill was critical, saying that the burger looked like 'dog food' Fast food is big business in the UK with 85 per cent of the British public indulging in it once a month. KFC has a global turnover of $23billion (\u00a315) a year, and a billion of that comes from the UK alone. Some 700 million fried pieces of chicken were sold in the UK in 2014.

Shaun Ingram booked his Ford Focus ST in for a major service and MOT at Halfords Autocentre in Plymouth last month, costing \u00a3255. But when he went to collect his car, he was shocked to discover that a mechanic had taken it for a spin after his dashcam recorded footage of it being driven at 57mph in a 30 mph zone. Scroll down for video . Footage taken by a dashcam fitted by Shaun Ingram to his Ford Focus ST, which showed a mechanic taking a customer's car for a joyride at 57mph in a 30mph zone . Shaun Ingram, from Saltash in Cornwall, who discovered the footage, says it shows it was a pre-planned thing, not spur of the moment . Mr Ingram, 50, of Saltash in Cornwall, said that his camera recorded almost seven hours of footage, which included the mechanic swearing and boasting about test-driving the car. He explained: 'When I saw the footage I was left open-mouthed. The mechanic was abusing my car and my trust. 'As a nationwide company I thought I had nothing to worry about. But I feel very let down. 'From now on I will always wait by the car whilst it is being serviced.' Mr Ingram, who is a married father-of three and works as a large goods vehicle assessor for Dairy Crest, said that the dashboard camera was not switched but was on standby mode on a motion sensor. He said: 'I was not trying to catch anybody out. I bought the camera- ironically - from a Halfords store in Plymouth last year. The dashcam captured seven hours worth of footage after Mr Ingram left his car at the Plymouth branch of Halfords . Footage showing the car being taken out on a test drive captured by the dashcam. It also showed\u00a0included the mechanic swearing and boasting about test-driving the car . 'I have it in for road safety purposes because of the way some people drive. 'I did not look at the footage on the Friday afternoon when I picked the car up. 'I saw it the next day and I almost choked on my pasty. The biggest file on there was the road test where the mechanic was doing nearly twice the speed limit. 'I then decided to look at all the footage. There was one clip of him reversing the car off the MOT bay and leaning over to tell a colleague \u2018you wait til I road test this later.\u2019 'That shows that it was something that was pre-planned and not a spur of the moment thing when he was driving my car. Mr Ingram says the dashcam had been switched to standby mode and came on due to its motion sensor . 'There is another clip of him constantly swearing when he can\u2019t find the key sensor. 'I have not been given his name and I don\u2019t need to know unless I get a speeding ticket. 'There is no point getting really angry about it. But it is fair to say I was open-mouthed when I saw the footage. 'I took the laptop in on the Monday morning and the manager was very non-plussed when I showed him the footage. 'Had he apologised then I would have left it. But I have now spoken with the head office and the regional manager and still not received an apology. At least they have started to take it more seriously though. 'I look after my car - it is my biggest asset and cost me nearly \u00a310,000 and it is disgusting that someone like him treats it like this. 'I would never have known about it if I did not have the camera. I did not know it would pick it up but it has proved to be well worth the money.' Halfords have explained that the mechanic who drove the car was a temporary employee at the branch in Plymouth, who has since been removed from this role. The company described his behaviour as \u201cappalling\u201d and offered to refund the cost for the MOT and service. The regional manager for Halfords Autocentres, Darren Stone, also told Mr Stone in an email that the mechanic\u2019s behaviour was unacceptable. He said: 'He drove your car in what I can only describe as an appalling manner. 'I do not and will never condone that level of pure neglect which is why the mechanic in question has been removed from working within the Halfords Autocentre Group.' Meanwhile a spokesperson for Halfords head office said: 'We were really disappointed to find out that this had happened and that we have let the customer down. 'We are treating this isolated incident as a priority and can confirm that the mechanic no longer works at Halfords. 'Please rest assured that we take issues like this very seriously ensuring that our 300 Halfords Autocentres always adhere to all road test procedures.'",

Colin Mcinerney, 28, claims he was beaten and had his head stomped on by a man, two teenagers and a boy aged only about 10 on Friday night at the fast food restaurant in Coolalinga near Darwin. The man's 22-year-old girlfriend, Rachael Sheppard, told the NT News he had just gestured at the family by waving with his little pinky as people do in Darwin. Colin Mcinerney, 28, claims he was beaten and had his head stomped on by a man, two teenagers and a boy aged only about 10 on Friday night at the fast food restaurant in Coolalinga near Darwin . 'Then we arrived at Maccas and pulled up and the same car came through the drive through and the man got out and started yelling at us and asking what the hand gesture was all about and going right off his head,' Ms Sheppard said. Despite telling the family they thought they were someone different, the older man allegedly started bashing Mr Mcinerney. 'He even smashed a beer bottle over Col's head... it didn't look good,' Ms Sheppard said. 'I was yelling for him to stop and next thing you know three boys have jumped out of the back of their car and started bashing Col too.' Ms Sheppard said a woman behind the wheel of the car allegedly tried to ram her as Mr Mcinerney ran for cover at a nearby petrol station. '(They) caught up with Col and kept bashing and choking him,' she said.

        "article": "(CNN)Sofia Vergara's ex-fiance is speaking out about their dispute over frozen embryos created while they dated. In an op-ed published by The New York Times on Wednesday,  Nick Loeb explained his rationale for fighting to keep the two female embryos he shares with the actress. \"I wanted to keep this private, but recently the story broke to the world,\" Loeb wrote. \"It has gotten attention not only because of the people involved -- my ex is Sofia Vergara, who stars in the ABC series \"Modern Family\" -- but also because embryonic custody disputes raise important questions about life, religion and parenthood.\" Loeb says he met the actress in 2010 and they got engaged two years later, at which point they decided to create the embryos and conceive a child via a surrogate. After two attempts failed to bring fertilized embryos to term, they created two more embryos using her eggs and his sperm. \"When we create embryos for the purpose of life, should we not define them as life, rather than as property?,\" he said. \"... A woman is entitled to bring a pregnancy to term even if the man objects. Shouldn't a man who is willing to take on all parental responsibilities be similarly entitled to bring his embryos to term even if the woman objects?\" Loeb said he filed a complaint against the 42-year-old actress to prevent her from destroying their two embryos conceived through in vitro fertilization. He filed it in August in Santa Monica, California, where they apparently lived while they dated. \"We signed a form stating that any embryos created through the process could be brought to term only with both parties' consent. The form did not specify -- as California law requires -- what would happen if we separated,\" he said. \" I am asking to have it voided.\" Representatives for Vergara have declined to comment in the past. Loeb has said he believes \"life begins at fertilization\" and wants to implant the embryos in a surrogate and bring them to term. He said he doesn't want any money from the egg donor. The case has led to questions about who has the right to embryos. Typically, a prior legal agreement between a couple spells out who has ultimate authority, said fertility specialist Dr. David Tourgeman, who's not involved in this case. \"Usually when embryos are created, whether the couple is married or just consenting adults, there's usually a power of attorney that is described to these embryos, if they are frozen for future use,\" he said. In most cases, the mother or the origin of the egg is given power of attorney, although anyone can make a request, Tourgeman said. If there's a disagreement, the courts usually get involved to decide who legally owns the embryos, he said. Vergara is now reportedly engaged to actor Joe Manganiello.",

The 2013 US Open champion ended the day on seven under, sharing third place and is one of a handful of players hanging on to the coat tails of runaway leader Jordan Spieth. But it took a neat bit of psychology to rescue his round after a disastrous start as he tried to build on his opening-day 67. Rose bogeyed three of the first four holes, finding himself playing from the trees as he recovered from wayward tee shots. And that was where the magic pencil line came to his rescue. He revealed: \u2018I was feeling really uncomfortable with my game, so I drew a line on my scorecard at that point, like you draw a line in the sand. Justin Rose battled back from a nightmare start and is in contention at Augusta . Rose tees off at the 18th as he now sits joint third, seven shots behind runaway leader Jordan Spieth . Rose flips his club after hitting from a trap on the 13th during a decent round for the Englishman . \u2018I told myself to move on and take one shot at a time. I made a great birdie at the 5th and that rallied me, and after that I played with the same rhythm as the first day.\u2019 The dramatic transformation was then followed by a spectacular back nine with birdies at both par threes, putting tee shots to within a few feet of the hole both times. And 34-year-old Rose believes the change of fortune can continue into the weekend. He said: \u2018I\u2019m starting seven back and Jordan has played beautifully so far, but we all know a lot can happen. There\u2019s magic out there on this course and it\u2019s up to me to make something special happen.\u2019 Maybe Ian Poulter could borrow Rose\u2019s pencil after a disappointing day in which his putter couldn\u2019t get going. He was par for the round after bogeying the 18th and sits at one over for the tournament. He said on Twitter: \u2018Really disappointed. It\u2019s simply unacceptable and disgraceful putting \u2014 34 putts for level par is pathetic.\u2019 Earlier, 19-year-old Scot Bradley Neil had a tough day, shooting a 79 and finishing 13 over. He has ben tipped for big things by Rory McILroy but admitted: \u2018I\u2019d prepared well for this, but it shows my game is not good enough yet,\u2019 he admitted. \u2018I need to work hard on it if I want to get back here.\u2019",

The Queen's Guard was left red-faced after he slipped on a manhole cover during the popular Changing of the Guard - and unfortunately for him the entire incident was caught on camera. He lost his footing and slid sideways, knocking his bearskin on the side of the box and dropping his rifle. The Queen's Guard (pictured) slipped on a manhole cover during the popular Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace last week. Unfortunately for him, the entire incident was caught on a tourist's camera . The embarrassed soldier quickly scrambled to his feet as his colleagues marched past as if nothing had happened. But the young guard started to blush as he peered at the crowd from under his bearskin and realised how many people had seen his slapstick moment. Holidaymaker David Meadwell recorded the unscheduled manouevre outside Buckingham Palace on Thursday afternoon. Mr Meadwell, 50, from Newcastle-upon-Tyne, said: 'I was with my family for a trip to London and I thought I'd take some pictures of the changing of the guards. Tourist David Meadwell shot this footage of the Changing of the Guard last week when the incident unfolded . The moment it all started to go wrong: The guard leans heavily to the side as he appears to slip . The unidentified young guard's legs appear to get a bit tangled as he tries to turn to march away . The guard, wearing full regalia, falls heavily to the floor still clutching his rifle following the slip up . 'The first group changed successfully, without any problems, and so I decided to video the next group doing it. 'I didn't expect anything like this to happen - he went flying. There were quite a few people around and there were a lot of gasps as he went down. 'I think he just slipped on a manhole cover, he looked so embarrassed.' The unnamed solider is thought to have slipped because of the metal protectors nailed to the soles of his boots. Tourists gather in their thousands to watch the changing of the guard outside Buckingham Palace at 11.30am every day in the summer and every other day in the winter. The Guard comprises two detachments, one each for Buckingham Palace and St James's Palace, under the command of the Captain of The Queen's Guard. Contrary to popular belief they are not purely ceremonial and are fully operational soldiers. The Ministry of Defence said they would not comment on 'a young man falling over while doing his job'. The embarrassed guard hastily scrambled to his feet following the unfortunate tumble at the palace .

        "article": "Amanda Knox may have finally cleared her name, but eight years of legal battles have left the Seattle native penniless, exhausted and traumatized from stress, claims her biographer. 'In prison, she was threatened with rape from a male guard, it was a really terrible experience,' says Trial By Jury author, Douglas Preston. 'I think it has really affected her, it's really hard to lead a normal life after that.' Scroll down for video . Strain and relief: Amanda Knox spoke outside her parents' home on March 27 flanked by her fianc\u00e9 Colin Sutherland after she was exonerated for the murder of Meredith Kercher in November 2007 . Three weeks after an Italian court overturned her conviction for the 2007 murder of British student, Meredith Kercher, Preston told RadarOnline that Knox is living out a bittersweet victory. 'She went to Italy as a normal 20-year-old, West Coast girl, a soccer player, rock climber, very na\u00efve,' says Preston about Knox's ill-fated adventure to Perugia. 'So many terrible things happened to her in Italy, so many lies were said, and the online savagery directed at her, I've never seen anything like it.' So affected has Knox been by her struggle to be exonerated by the Italian courts, that Preston hinted to RadarOnline that she is suffering PTSD and seeking professional help. 'Anyone who has been through what she's been through is going to have issues. It's like a soldier come back from Iraq, having children shot in front of him, you've been through a horrific experience. If it doesn't affect you physically, it affects you emotionally,' he says to Radar. Family struggle: Amanda Knox stands on the front porch with her fianc\u00e9, her mother Edda Mellas and stepfather, Chris Mellas. According to her biographer, Knox and her family have spent millions fighting her conviction . On top of her fight to be declared innocent, Preston claims that Knox has been ravaged financially by legal fees. This despite receiving a reported $4 million advance for her 2013 book, Waiting To Be Heard. 'The ordeal has been hugely emotional, but the financial impact has been catastrophic,' says Preston. 'Amanda received a $4 million advance for her book, that money has all gone, immediately out of the door to pay legal fees and there is nothing left,' Preston explains. 'She really wants to establish that she's innocent in Italy, they've paid a lot of fees to Italian lawyers.' Knox, 27, fought the Italian legal system for eight years, spent four years in prison and went through three appeals until she and her ex-boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito were exonerated by the Italian Supreme Court in late March for the murder of Meredith Kercher. Shared experience: This split picture shows Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito, arriving with penitentiary police to a court hearing in Perugia September 26, 2008 . Beginning of her nightmare: Amanda Knox leaves with penitentiary police after a court hearing in Perugia in September 2008 after she and her ex-boyfriend were arrested for the murder of Meredith Kercher . Kercher was discovered in a pool of blood in the house she shared with Kercher in November 2007. The British student had been stabbed four times and her throat slit in what the Italian courts claimed was a sex-game gone wrong. Knox and Sollecito was found guilty of her murder and sentenced to 26 years behind bars, but were acquitted in 2011. Knox immediutely returned to the United States protesting her innocence, but in January 2014, the Italian courts overturned that acquittal and reinstated the guilty verdict. However, the case ultimately went to the Supreme Court and their conviction was overturned. Tears: Amanda Knox breaks down after hearing she had been acquitted of the murder of Meredith Kercher in October, 2011 . Return home: Amanda Knox pauses emotionally while speaking during a news conference at Sea-Tac International Airport, Washington after landing there on a flight from Italy, October 4, 2011 after her acquittal . On the announcement of her innocence, Knox appeared on her Seattle doorstep to make a statement. Surrounded by her father, Curt Knox, mother, Edda Mellas, sister, Deanna Knox, and fianc\u00e9, Colin Sutherland, the 27-year-old broke down in tears as she told the press: 'Meredith was my friend and she deserved so much in this life. I am the lucky one.' Amanda Knox could now receive millions in compensation after being cleared by Italy's top court of murdering Surrey student Meredith Kercher. The 27-year-old and her former lover Raffaele Sollecito both served four years in prison after being convicted of the murder in 2007. It is thought that Knox will return to Italy, despite having vowed never to, and will write about the country's legal and judicial system while she is there. Both Knox and Sollecito are reportedly planning to seek compensation for time wrongly spent in prison. Both Knox (above) and Sollecito could now seek compensation for time wrongly spent in prison . While no figures have been revealed, compensation for such cases regularly run into seven figure sums. Carlo Dalla Vedova, her Italian lawyer, confirmed Miss Knox will 'be seeking compensation for wrongful imprisonment,' according to The Telegraph. Mr Sollecito\u2019s father Francesco told the newspaper: 'You could hardly quantify a compensation figure, it has been such an awful business.' She added that she was 'full of joy' following Italy's highest court's decision to overturn her murder conviction, saying: 'I'm incredibly grateful for what has happened. For the justice I have received, for the support I have had from everyone, from my family and my friends to strangers.' Shortly after the verdict, Knox, who has said she would never willingly return to Italy, released a statement, saying she was 'tremendously relieved and grateful' and knowing she was innocent gave her 'strength in the darkest times of this ordeal'. She added: 'Throughout this ordeal, I have received invaluable support from family, friends, and strangers. To them, I say thank you from the bottom of my heart. Your kindness has sustained me.'",

Argentine Jorge Lopez was killed in a suspicious road accident while in Sao Paulo in July. Guardiola was sporting the top - which read \u2018#JusticiaParaTopo\u2019 - during his pre-match press conference before Bayern Munich emphatically dumped Porto out of the Champions League. The message appeared to support a campaign to investigate Lopez\u2019s death. UEFA have charged Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola after he wore this t-shirt in a press conference . Guardiola wore the top demanding justice for Jorge 'El Topo' Lopez who died in a car crash at the World Cup . UEFA say Guardiola has been disciplined because of an \u2018incident of a non-sporting nature\u2019 Jorge 'El Topo' Lopez was killed when a taxi he was travelling back to his hotel in was hit by a stolen car . Lopez was killed when a taxi he was traveling back to his hotel in was hit by a stolen car being chased by police. UEFA revealed that the Spanish manager had been disciplined because of an \u2018incident of a non-sporting nature\u2019, in a move likely to cause public outcry. The European governing body\u2019s disciplinary regulations read: \u2018A breach of these principles is committed by anyone who uses sporting events for manifestations of a non-sporting nature.\u2019 They are to review the case on May 21. On wearing the shirt, Guardiola said: \u2018Last week, the family has given me the T-shirt. I woke up this morning and knew that I would put it.\u2019 Lopez was a highly regarded journalist in South America and his passing drew huge outpouring from the very top of the game. Last year Atletico Madrid boss and former Argentina midfielder Diego Simeone tweeted that Lopez was \u2018not only a great journalist\u2019 but \u2018also a friend\u2019 after hearing of the news. Lionel Messi dedicated Argentina's World Cup semi-final win to the 38-year-old, who died in Sao Paolo . FIFA, Diego Simeone and Javier Mascherano have also paid tribute to Lopez (pictured with Alfredo de Stefano) Jorge 'El Topo' Lopez was working for La Red Radio at the World Cup in Brazil, as well as Ole and Spanish publications AS and Sport. Married to Marca's Argentina correspondent, Veronica Brunatti, L\u00f3pez was well connected in Spain, where he arrived to follow the career of Javier Saviola in 2001. Saviola and Topo Lopez remained close friends and he was Ole's correspondent in Barcelona, a newspaper he had worked with since its launch. He had worked as a journalist for two decades, covering River Plate and Argentina for Ole while collaborating with Spanish daily Sport while spending time back in Buenos Aires. In 2010 he became AS's correspondent in Argentina was the journalist closest to Lionel Messi and the many of his team-mates. Lionel Messi also dedicated Argentina\u2019s World Cup semi-final win to the 38-year-old. \u2018Big hug to all the Argentina fans and a very special memory for Jorge \u201cTopo\u201d Lopez,' wrote Messi after their penalties victory against Germany. 'This victory is especially for you, my friend. A big hug to the family, lots of strength.' Earlier this month Javier Mascherano devoted the launch of his new book to Lopez, while he and Messi were both pictured holding placards with the message on late last year. So too did legend Diego Maradona. Both Barcelona and Atletico Madrid have posed in front of a board during team photographs.

The \u00a31.5million valued super-car was delivered just 11 hours later, and was added to his collection of impressive motors. Obi Okeke, who owns Fusion Luxury Motors, was interviewed on the video on Mayweather's Facebook page and spoke about the very late phone call he received. Floyd Mayweather rang his car dealer at 3am to order a \u00a31.5million Bugatti to be delivered in 12 hours . Obi Okele, the owner of Fusion Luxury Motors, was given the task of getting Mayweather the Bugatti . He said: 'The most challenging thing I've ever done for Floyd is when he called me at three o'clock in the morning and said, Obi, I want a Bugatti and I want one in my driveway in 12 hours. 'I then showered, went into my office, did some work and hopped on a plane and got the car, in his driveway, in 11 hours and that makes me a better person, it makes me work harder, it makes me not limit myself, so those are the things that rub off on me from him.' It's not the only request that Okele has had to deal with from Mayweather's extravagant demands, as the fighter once turned up at the dealership at 2am - walking out with a Ferrari Enzo. 'I got a call from overseas in the Middle East that there was a US-spec Enzo for sale, so I hopped on a plane and flew to Abu Dhabi. I then transacted the car and put it in a Boeing 777 passenger plane and flew it out of Abu Dhabi. 'So Floyd came to the dealership and he kept coming and looking at the car. Then he came in one night around two in the morning and said, \"Obi, I wanna buy two Ferrari 458s,\" and that's what he said. 'Then I said OK, then he pauses for a minute and goes, \"Obi, I'm not going to buy them 458s, I want to buy that Enzo and I want to buy it now. Lets go.\"' Mayweather's mega-fight with Manny Pacquiao is just three weeks away and the undefeated champion continues to work in the gym and keep his impressive record intact. This Bugatti is similar to the one Mayweather purchased at 3am and is worth an estimated \u00a31.5million .

        "article": "A stunning new series of photographs of the late artist Frida Kahlo have been released as part of a new book. In the images, which are featured in Frida Kahlo: The Gis\u00e8le Freund Photographs, the formidable painter is seen at her most relaxed, walking around her house in Mexico. The pictures portray the artist in her garden or languishing in her bed, giving an unparralled insight into her life with many of the pictures taken in the years before her death in 1954. Scroll down for video . In the beautiful new pictures by\u00a0Gis\u00e8le Freund the late artist Frida is seen at her most intimate, her she is pictured standing in her garden in Mexico . Beautiful Frida poses in her house (left), in one picture she is seen lying in bed surrounded by books (right) Frida, whose real name was Frida Kahlo de Rivera, was a painter who was best known for her self portraits. These images were strong and she has become  a feminist icon for her striking and unapologetic style, her monobrow and signature, colourful outfits inspired by traditional Mexican  costume. The new  photographs were taken by Gis\u00e8le Freund, a German-born French photographer, who had travelled to Mexico in 1950. Having initially only planned to stay for two weeks she ended up staying for two years after becoming friends with Frida and her husband, artist Diego Rivera. Friday looks happy and relaxed here as she reclines on her sofa in a high necked shirt . Frida Kahlo and Dr Juan Farill photographed in her home, 1951, they are standing in front of one of Frida's paintings that was done of the pair . Frida Kahlo: The Gis\u00e8le Freund Photographs Photographs by Gis\u00e8le Freund Texts by G\u00e9rard de Cortanze, Gis\u00e8le Freund, and Lorraine Audric Published by Abrams . Gisele lived with the couple and began taking many photographs of the pair as they went about their daily lives. In the introduction to the book, Cortanze quotes Freund's impressions of Kahlo which she had told to Rauda Jamis who wrote a book about the artist. She is said to have said: 'She was a formidable being, but in great distress \u2026 not only because of the physical pain due to her terrible tram accident but because she was a deeply conflicted being. 'She loved men, but did not turn away from women. She would shower you with gifts large and small, ranging from a charm, a tiny brass ex-voto, or a good luck stone to pre-Columbian pottery, as well as the heavy jewelry that she was crazy about \u2026 . 'One day she told me: I don't want to live a long time. I am really suffering too much.' Frida spent much of her life in pain after a tram accident in 1925. Then a young woman she suffered serious injuries after the vehicle that she was riding in collided with a trolley car. These included damage to her spinal column, a broken collarbone, broken ribs, a broken pelvis, 11 fractures in her right leg, a crushed and dislocated right foot, and a dislocated shoulder. It was the accident which forced her to focus on her painting and give up a potential career in medicine which she had been studying. Kahlo painted to pass the time while she was stuck in bed during the time following the accident. She passed away at just 47 and it is reported that her marriage to Diego was a tumultuous. It is thought that both of them enjoyed extra-marital affairs with Diego angering his wife when he had a relationship with her sister. They divorced in 1939, however, they were back together again by 1940. For all of Frida's hard work though it wasn't really until after her death that her work began to gain world-wide recognition and over the years her pieces have been displayed around the world. Her unique look has also previously been emulated by many celebrities. The singer Beyonce once dressed up as Frida. Whilst in the artwork for her latest single 'B**** better have my money' she seems to have copied the artist's eyebrows. Some of the photographs show the inside of Frida's house, some of the walls of which were covered in pictures (left) she also kept dolls on her fireplace (right) There were many interesting artefacts in Frida's house including this turtle which was tucked away under a table .

        "article": "If your partner snores heavily in bed, you might be tempted to give them a poke in the ribs and go back to sleep. But that irritating nocturnal drone might actually be an early warning sign of dementia, scientists have warned. Researchers have discovered that people who have breathing problems while asleep are more likely to experience an early decline in memory and other brain functions. In a worrying study, they found that people with sleep apnoea - a condition often typified by heavy snoring - saw a mental decline more than a decade earlier, on average, than those who had no sleep problems. People who have breathing problems while asleep are more likely to experience an early decline in memory and other brain functions . The US researchers\u2019 results also suggested that the onset of Alzheimer\u2019s might be accelerated among those with sleeping problems. At least half a million Britons suffer from sleep apnoea, which is most often found in middle-aged, overweight men. The condition causes the muscles in the airway to contract during sleep, which cuts off the air supply, usually resulting in a heavy snore. It causes disrupted sleep and daytime exhaustion, pushing up blood pressure. Study author Dr Ricardo Osorio, of New York University, said: \u2018Abnormal breathing patterns during sleep such as heavy snoring and sleep apnoea are common in the elderly.\u2019 The research team studied the medical histories of 2,470 people, aged 55 to 90. Their investigation, published in the journal Neurology, found that people with sleep breathing problems were diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment at an average age of 77. Those with no breathing problems, in comparison, did not typically see a decline until age 90 - more than a decade later. Among that group, those who had sleep breathing problems also developed Alzheimer\u2019s disease five years earlier than those who did not have sleep breathing problems, at an average age of 83 compared to 88. The onset of Alzheimer\u2019s might be accelerated among those with sleeping problem, experts said (file photo) The scientists also found that treating the problem with a night time air mask - known as continuous positive airway pressure or CPAP - saw significant results. People treated with the machine, which pumps a steady stream of air through the mask, were diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment about ten years later than people whose problems were not treated, at age 82 instead of age 72. Dr Osorio said: \u2018The age of onset of mild cognitive impairment for people whose breathing problems were treated was almost identical to that of people who did not have any breathing problems at all. \u2018Given that so many older adults have sleep breathing problems, these results are exciting - we need to examine whether using CPAP could possibly help prevent or delay memory and thinking problems.\u2019 For years we have been told that the first step to staying healthy is to keep to a healthy weight - that means making sure your Body Mass Index (BMI) is within the normal range of 18 to 24. Few people are advised to gain weight, unless their BMI is below 18, but could that change? A study published last week suggests that overweight people are less likely to develop dementia. The researchers, drawn mostly from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, analysed the medical records of nearly two million people for up to ten years and found that those who were overweight (with a BMI of 25 to 29) had an 18 per cent lower risk of dementia compared to those with a healthy BMI. Remarkably the obese (with a BMI of 30 plus) did even better; they were 24 per cent less likely to develop dementia. Being underweight increased the dementia risk by 39 per cent. His team did not establish exactly why heavy snoring might cause early dementia, but previous research has established links between sleep disruption and dementia. Dr Osorio said: \u2018These findings were made in an observational study and as such, do not indicate a cause-and-effect relationship. \u2018However, we are now focusing our research on CPAP treatment and memory and thinking decline over decades, as well as looking specifically at markers of brain cell death and deterioration.\u2019 British charities last night welcomed the findings. Dr Doug Brown, director of research and development at the Alzheimer\u2019s Society, said: \u2018Most of us don\u2019t think of snoring as something to be concerned about but frequent, loud snoring could be a sign of sleep apnoea - a disorder that affects breathing during sleep. \u2018In this study, those who reported a sleep apnoea developed cognitive decline a decade earlier than those without sleep breathing problems, but the link between sleep apnoea and Alzheimer\u2019s disease was much less clear. \u2018Several earlier studies have shown that the quantity and quality of sleep we get can have an impact on our cognitive health and as sleeping disorders are common among the elderly, it is vital that we see more research into this area.\u2019 Dr Simon Ridley of Alzheimer\u2019s Research UK, added: \u2018This study adds to evidence that disrupted breathing during sleep could be a risk factor for memory and thinking decline in older age, but it doesn\u2019t prove that one causes the other. \u2018Despite the small sample size in this study, the researchers did try to account for other factors that may have explained the link and the findings highlight the need to delve deeper into the possible biological reasons behind this association. \u2018A good supply of oxygen to the brain is vital to keep it healthy and it is interesting to see that treatment of sleep apnoea was associated with a trend towards a later onset of memory and thinking problems.\u2019",

        "article": "Jurors have started deliberations in the case against a man accused of killing 6-year-old\u00a0Etan Patz, whose 1979 disappearance while on his way to school helped galvanize the national missing-children's movement. Etan Patz 'is larger than his very little, important life,' Assistant District Attorney Joan Illuzzi-Orbon said in closing arguments at the Manhattan murder trial of Pedro Hernandez. She asked jurors to convict Hernandez of murder, saying he was a calculated killer who committed a terrible crime and then spent three decades trying to hide from it. Shira Patz and Stanley Patz, the sister and father of Etan Patz, arrive for court, in New York,  Wednesday: Jurors have started deliberations in the case against Pedro Hernandez . Pedro Hernandez, left, is accused of killing 6-year-old Etan Patz, right, who vanished in 1979 . Hernandez confessed in 2012 in a case that has confounded law enforcement for decades. Etan's body was never found, nor was any trace of clothing or his belongings. He had never been considered a suspect - his name appears only once in law enforcement paperwork at the time Etan disappeared. The defense says the admissions are made up, the ravings of a mentally ill man who sees visions and has a low IQ. A teenage stock clerk at the corner shop, Hernandez knew there were children in and out of the store, and Etan had been there countless times, the prosecutor said. She said Hernandez saw Etan with a dollar and calculated he wanted a drink, so he asked him to the basement. 'Day after day he saw this beautiful little boy,' she said. 'One day, he acted on an impulse and did something terrible to this little boy.' She said the motive was sexual, and Etan likely fought back. 'The quickest and easiest way to shut him up and shut him up permanently was to choke him to death,' she said. Rosemary Hernandez, left, and Becky Hernandez, the wife and daughter of Pedro Hernandez, arrive for court in New York, on Wednesday . Stanley Patz, left, the father of Etan Patz, arrives for court on Wednesday, although his estranged wife Julie, right, hasn't been pictured at court in recent days . Illuzzi-Orbon said his first confession to a prayer group shortly after the boy disappeared was the most accurate - he was confessing to God, and he was trying to unburden himself. Prayer circle members testified that Hernandez made tearful admissions during a 1979 retreat that matched some of what he told authorities on video 33 years later: He gave a child a soda, took him to the store basement and choked him. Two said Hernandez also admitted abusing the boy; when talking to police, Hernandez denied molesting Etan. A former neighbor and his ex-wife also testified he told them about killing someone in New York. The Maple Shade, New Jersey, man made the stunning admissions to police after authorities received a tip from a relative who saw news reports of the case in 2012. Site: Hernandez was working in 1979 at this corner convenience store, near where Etan was last seen where the man said he threw the boy's body into trash . 'I grabbed him by the neck and started choking him,' said Hernandez, now 54. 'I was nervous. My legs were jumping. I wanted to let go, but I just couldn't let go. I felt like something just took over me.' Defense attorney Harvey Fishbein said the confession video shows 'a man sitting there convinced he killed a child - on a day that he doesn't know, at a time he doesn't know, at a location near a bus stop that he doesn't know.' The defense has suggested that the real killer is a convicted pedophile jailed in Pennsylvania who was the longtime suspect in the case. That man, Jose Ramos, denies involvement. However, a former federal prosecutor and FBI agent testified that Ramos told investigators he was '90 percent' sure a boy he took from a park was Etan, and Hernandez's former prison cellmate testified that Ramos admitted molesting the boy. 'Two confessions,' Fishbein said. 'Which person is more likely to have been a predator?' Etan's photo was one of the first on milk cartons. The day he went missing, May 25, became National Missing Children's Day. Etan Patz's 1979 disappearance while on his way to school helped galvanize the national missing-children's movement .",

And that's exactly what they get with the 223ft Explorer, which comes with its own helipad, infinity pool and plenty for space for supercar and jetski storage. With space for 12 lucky guests on board, the concept yacht from British yacht designer Tony Castro is the ultimate toy for the extremely wealthy and has been dubbed the 'Range Rover of the seas'. The 223ft Explorer is an exclusive superyacht which comes with its own helipad and car storage as well as space for 12 guests . For those who don't fancy taking a dip in the sea, there is an infinity pool on deck which is two decks deep . For those who would rather board unseen, there is a helipad and helicopter storage as well as space for a submarine . It was designed to withstand any weather conditions and is sturdy enough to circumnavigate the globe - all while looking incredibly stylish, of course. When it comes to transporting all those extras any cruising millionaire needs to hand, there's plenty of space for all of them. The company explains: 'With a large carrying capacity for toys and tenders, she is capable of carrying a helicopter in a climate controlled garage, twin limo tenders, car, submarine, jetskis, paddleboards and a variety of inflatables water toys.' Once the helicopter has landed, it can be store din a climate-controlled garage area . There is storage for jetskis and a submarine on the decks, while leaving plenty of other areas free for passengers . But of course, the life of the ultra-wealthy comes at a cost. According to Tony Castro Design, the superyacht costs approximately 40million euros (around \u00a329million/$43million) to build, which means it is likely to cost even more to purchase. While the yacht has been designed with 'rugged utilitarian-looking aesthetics', it is actually a sumptuous retreat at sea. For the 12 guests, there is space on the yacht for 15 crew, ensuring there is nothing always someone on hand to make sure the journey goes smoohtly. The layout means there are a huge variety of different areas for guests to retreat to, ensuring they don't get fed up with each other while sailing around the world. And for those who can't bear to leave their convertible at home, they can even bring their car on board . Special sundecks open out form the yacht, providing areas for loungers, complete with ladders down into the sea in case guests want to cool off in the water . Unfortunately for most, the superyacht costs 40million euros to build, meaning it will retail for even more . The designers explain: 'Her unique layout holds a full beam enclosed observation deck with opening roof, cinema, beach club, sauna, scuba diving pool, gymnasium, pool, wine cellar and ample space to accommodate a total of 12 guests.' And of course, there are all the other luxurious finishing touches you would expect to find on board. The guests of honour can enjoy accommodation in the Master Cabin or VIP suite, while others can choose between four other double guest cabins. There are also plenty of 'terrace' area, with sunloungers, giving the impression of sitting on the beach as the water laps the sands.

The appalling conditions of a dog training centre where illegal pitbulls covered in scars were forced to wear electric shock collars and train on treadmills has been caught in shocking footage . RSPCA officers discovered the five illegal pit bull terrier-type dogs at a make-shift farm in Lancashire where they had been brutally trained to take part in illegal dog fights . One of the dogs ears had been bitten off.\u00a0All five illegal dogs - Dingo, Sheeba, Zula, Fenton and Mousey - were ordered to be destroyed . Three\u00a0men involved in illegal dog fights have been fined a total of \u00a340,000 for a catalogue of appalling animal cruelty offences after RSPCA inspectors raided their homes. All five illegal dogs - Dingo, Sheeba, Zula, Fenton and Mousey - were ordered to be destroyed. Darren Wheatcroft pleaded guilty to attempting to arrange a fight between illegal pit bull terrier-type dogs, while his son, Callan, and farmer Simon Whitworth pleaded guilty to training the animals for fighting. All three were handed suspended prison sentences and ordered to pay a total of \u00a340,000 to the RSPCA at Burnley Magistrates' Court, Lancashire. Footage shown to the court showed some of the animals, which were imported from the Netherlands and trained using treadmills, . Three men involved in illegal dog fights have been fined a total of \u00a340,000 for a catalogue of appalling animal cruelty offences after RSPCA inspectors raided their homes.\u00a0Darren Wheatcroft (centre) pleaded guilty to attempting to arrange a fight between illegal pit bull terrier-type dogs, while his son, Callan (left), and farmer Simon Whitworth (right) pleaded guilty to training the animals for fighting . Laptops, mobile phones and books were also seized in a joint investigation with Lancashire police known as Operation Cask. Messages were uncovered from Darren Wheatcroft offering a \u00a31,000 fee to secure a fight between his illegal dog and another. District Judge James Clarke slammed dogfighting for its role in 'creating a black market economy' in East Lancashire. He told the defendants: 'These dogs are illegal for a reason. They are dangerous in the eyes of parliament. Their characteristics and their training can lead to significant physical injury to one another and they are dangerous to the public. 'I shouldn't need to remind you that animals such as this have attacked members of your community. While not holding you responsible for that, you have knowingly involved yourself in an industry that perpetuates cruelty and criminality in relation to animals. 'The intention of fighting to the death shows a failure to take proper responsibility of these animals. I am satisfied that his took place over an extended period of time. 'Each of you has an unhealthy interest. You have invested a significant amount of finances and attempted - especially Darren Wheatcroft - to make money out of it, involving others and travelling abroad to acquire the animals. You were involved in criminality.' Darren Wheatcroft, 48, and his son Callan, 22, both of Accrington, admitted keeping and training three of the dogs. Whitworth, 44, of Oswaldtwistle, admitted keeping and training another two dogs. The footage shows the animals were held in electrical shock collars, covered with scars and were kept in urine-soaked cages without water . In his summary of events, RSPCA prosecutor Chris Wyatt said that the animals had a large number of scars. The court also heard home medication kits had been found during the raids . The pitbull type dogs were all seized and ordered to be destroyed by the courts . Darren Wheatcroft admitted a further charge of arranging a dogfight, although the RSPCA could not prove that the event ever took place. Simon Farnsworth, representing the three defendants, said: 'It is not fair to deal with all defendants equally harshly. 'Callan Wheatcroft may well have been involved under the influence of his father.' In his summary of events, RSPCA prosecutor Chris Wyatt said that the animals had a large number of scars. The court also heard home medication kits had been found during the raids. But he added: 'It cannot be proved that these injuries were the result of recent fights or that the defendants were in possession of the dogs when they may have been involved in fights with other animals.' Callan Wheatcroft, a part-time cameraman who films Blackburn Rovers football matches, was given a 16-week prison sentence, suspended for 18 months, and fined \u00a310,000. Father-of-two Whitworth, who works on his parents' farm, was given the same suspended prison sentence but fined \u00a315,000. Married Darren Wheatcroft, who also has a daughter, was handed a 20-week prison sentence, suspended for 18 months, and also fined \u00a315,000. All three, who had originally denied the charges, were ordered to do 150 hours of unpaid community work and banned from keeping dogs for life. Speaking after the hearing, chief inspector Ian Briggs, from the RSPCA's special operations unit, said: 'These people were actively involved in the dogfighting scene. 'They sourced dogs specifically for dogfighting, including going abroad. They were thoroughly knowledgeable in what they were trying to do and they set out deliberately to build up a stock of fighting dogs at their premises. 'We've got the result we wanted and they have been punished accordingly.' An RSPCA spokesman added: 'After fights many dogs are left with horrific injuries and rather than taking them to a vet, dog fighters will perform crude surgeries without anesthetic. Often using staple guns or super glue to close up wounds. 'Most dogs used for fighting will ultimately either be killed in the ring, die as a result of their injuries or in some cases be killed by their owners.' If you suspect someone is taking part in dog fighting, call the RSPCA in confidence on 0300 1234 999 or report it to the police.",

        "article": "(CNN)Never mind cats having nine lives. A stray pooch in Washington State has used up at least three of her own after being hit by a car, apparently whacked on the head with a hammer in a misguided mercy killing and then buried in a field -- only to survive. That's according to Washington State University, where the dog -- a friendly white-and-black bully breed mix now named Theia -- has been receiving care at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital. Four days after her apparent death, the dog managed to stagger to a nearby farm, dirt-covered and emaciated, where she was found by a worker who took her to a vet for help. She was taken in by Moses Lake, Washington, resident Sara Mellado. \"Considering everything that she's been through, she's incredibly gentle and loving,\" Mellado said, according to WSU News. \"She's a true miracle dog and she deserves a good life.\" Theia is only one year old but the dog's brush with death did not leave her unscathed. She suffered a dislocated jaw, leg injuries and a caved-in sinus cavity -- and still requires surgery to help her breathe. The veterinary hospital's Good Samaritan Fund committee awarded some money to help pay for the dog's treatment, but Mellado has set up a fundraising page to help meet the remaining cost of the dog's care. She's also created a Facebook page to keep supporters updated. Donors have already surpassed the $10,000 target, inspired by Theia's tale of survival against the odds. On the fundraising page, Mellado writes, \"She is in desperate need of extensive medical procedures to fix her nasal damage and reset her jaw. I agreed to foster her until she finally found a loving home.\" She is dedicated to making sure Theia gets the medical attention she needs, Mellado adds, and wants to \"make sure she gets placed in a family where this will never happen to her again!\" Any additional funds raised will be \"paid forward\" to help other animals. Theia is not the only animal to apparently rise from the grave in recent weeks. A cat in Tampa, Florida, found seemingly dead after he was hit by a car in January, showed up alive in a neighbor's yard five days after he was buried by his owner. The cat was in bad shape, with maggots covering open wounds on his body and a ruined left eye, but remarkably survived with the help of treatment from the Humane Society.",

In scenes more familiar in the most impoverished refugee camps, scores of downtrodden Syrians wait in line for hours for food in the terror group's self-declared capital Raqqa. It's a far cry from the all-conquering image of prosperity its jihadi PR machine would like the world to believe. The pictures were posted on Twitter by a member of the anti-ISIS campaign group Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently who risk their lives every day by documenting atrocities from inside the city. Scroll down for video . Impoverished: Dozens of Syrians queue for food in the Islamic State's self-declared capital of Raqqa . Downtrodden: In scenes more familiar in the most impoverished refugee camps, the pictures are a far cry from the all-conquering image of prosperity that terror group's slick PR machine would like the world see . Abu Ibrahim Raqqawi one of the group's founders, wrote the accompanying message: 'Lines waiting for some food.\u00a0Yes this is the #ISIS State. Hunger, poverty and homelessness.' For those lucky enough to have a home, he paints a bleak picture of life spent in the dark and cold for hours on end. 'The city suffers from a shortage of electricity where the power goes off for 21 hours in the day,' he wrote in another tweet. ISIS prides itself on its well-oiled propaganda offensive, pumping out images, videos and even a weekly English-language magazine designed to recruit and radicalise would-be jihadists. Co-ordinated by its AlHayat Media Centre, the terror group makes extensive use of social media to keep in near-constant contact with supporters in the West - even selling branded merchandise such as T-shirts, baseball caps and cuddly toys. But as seen here, that ease of disseminating information can easily backfire. Most of the Syrians in this line appear to be woman and children.\u00a0The pictures were posted on Twitter by the anti-ISIS group Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently who risk their lives leaking information from the city . The food queue pictures emerged days after ISIS took their draconian rule to bizarre new levels by threatening to jail any man caught wearing skinny jeans in an apparent crackdown on hipsters. The terror group said it would also imprison anyone caught with music on their mobiles, smoking or turning up late for prayer in the city. Violators will be jailed for ten days, during which time they will be made to take an 'Islamic course'. At the end of their prison term, they will be forced to take a test, with those who pass being released immediately. Those who don't will be fined and kept in prison until they do. Other sickening sentences involve people being stoned to death for alleged adultery and thrown off buildings after being accused of being homosexual. Bleak picture: Abu Ibrahim Raqqawi one of the group's founders, wrote the accompanying message: 'Lines waiting for some food. Yes this is the #ISIS State. Hunger, poverty and homelessness' One resident, named only as Jassem, told the group how dozens of people had fled the city in the wake of the jihadi network's brutal enforcement of its twisted form of sharia law. He said: 'ISIS tightens penalties and uses the principle of intimidation in dealing with public, which led to the migration and escape of many people. \u00a0Freedom of expression has become a crime.' In a separate development, ISIS has announced that all nurses working in areas under their control must speak English - something the NHS still hasn't introduced. Revealing plans to open a school of nursing in Raqqa, the extremists also disclosed the tough entry requirements for prospective medical workers. Among them are rules that applicants are no more than 25 years of age, must be willing to work anywhere inside the territory controlled by the extremists, and must speak fluent English. The latter rule is something that even the NHS has yet fully put in place, with nurses who trained in European countries still able to treat patients without any formal language checks thanks to bureaucratic rules barring the Nursing and Midwifery Council testing EU candidates.",

        "article": "Every second of the day you are subjected to radiation from compounds in soil, buildings and even your own body. But for people who fly frequently, cosmic radiation can increase this exposure significantly. Now there is an app that records your personal radiation to reveal how much you are exposed to from from medical examinations, changes in your location, and flights. The TrackYourDose app (pictured) was developed by Germany-based firm esooka and uses a mathematical model developed by scientists and meteorologists. The \u00a31.49 ($1.99) iOS app keeps a record of a user's personal radiation including exposure from changes in a person's location and flights . The TrackYourDose app was developed by Germany-based esooka. It uses a mathematical model developed by scientists and meteorologists\u00a0from the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) in Germany and the University Oulu, Finland. Since 1997, PTB has studied the cosmic radiation at typical flight altitudes and used this to calculate radiation levels. To to do this, PTB's scientists developed a carry-on 'flight case'. Using the case, PTB's scientists measured more than 2,500 points at flight altitudes between 5 miles (8km) and 7.5 miles (12km) worldwide between 1997 and 2006. This covered geographical location, the flight altitude and solar activity. 6 \u00b5Sv: Typical radiation from a dentist's X-ray . 10 \u03bcSv: Average daily natural radiation . 40 \u03bcSv: Radiation from flying from New York to Los Angeles . 100 \u00b5Sv: Radiation from a 10-hour flight across the North Atlantic . 2,100 \u00b5Sv: Annual radiation of a typical person in Europe . 3,000 \u03bcSv: Radiation from a mammogram . 3,600 \u03bcSv: Average annual radiation of a US citizen . 50,000 \u03bcSv: Maximum allowable yearly occupational dose in the US . 100,000 \u03bcSv: Lowest yearly dose linked to increased risk of cancer . 2,000,000 \u03bcSv: Severe and potentially fatal . It can measure all the relevant types of radiation, in particular neutron radiation produced in the atmosphere. Using the TrackYourDose app, users enter the details of the airports they are flying from and to and the date they are travelling. The current solar activity for the flight is then inputted, using a neutron monitor of the University of Oulu in Finland. In addition to tracking cosmic radiation from air travel, the app accounts for gamma radiation and cosmic radiation on the ground and medical examinations with ionizing radiation such as X-rays or CT scans lead to radiation exposure. The measurement is called the 'ambient dose equivalent' and is recorded in microsieverts (\u00b5Sv). In the US, this is often measured in a unit called rem and one sievert is equivalent to 100 rem. A ten-hour flight across the North Atlantic, for instance, results in a radiation exposure of between 50 \u00b5Sv to 100 \u00b5Sv. By comparison, an X-ray at a dentist exposes patients to 6 \u00b5Sv, depending on the type of X-ray. In 2012, the total annual radiation exposure of a typical person in Europe, through naturally occurring radiation, came to about 2,100 \u00b5Sv. The same year a radiation monitor tracked 131\u00b5Sv per hour at the site of the Fukushima power plant. While the average radiation of someone in the US is 3,600\u00b5Sv. Experts studied the cosmic radiation at flight altitudes between 5 miles (8km) and 7.5 miles (12km) worldwide between 1997 and 2006. A TrackYourDose user enters their flights details and solar activity for the flight is inputted, using a neutron monitor from the University of Oulu in Finland . A 10-hour flight over the North Atlantic, for instance, results in a radiation exposure of between 50 \u00b5Sv to 100 \u00b5Sv. By comparison, an X-ray (stock image right) exposes patients to 6\u00b5Sv - depending on the X-ray, while a mammogram (right) produces 3,000 \u03bcSv. A dosage of 2,000,000 \u03bcSv is considered severe and potentially fatal . Airline pilots are at risk of deadly skin cancer because they are exposed to cockpit radiation similar to levels from tanning beds. Pilots flying for an hour at 30,000ft get the same amount of radiation as 20 minutes on a tanning bed. And researchers believe the levels could be higher when pilots are flying over thick clouds and snow fields, which can reflect UV radiation . A team from the University of California measured the amount of UV radiation in airplane cockpits during flights. The cockpit radiation was measured in the pilot seat of a general aviation turboprop airplane through the acrylic plastic windshield at ground level and at various heights above sea level. Sun exposures were measured in San Jose, California, and in Las Vegas around midday in April. They then compared them with measurements taken in tanning beds. While short-wave UV-B ultraviolet radiation cannot easily penetrate glass and plastic windows, long-wave UV-A is much more likely to get through. Both kinds of UV can cause skin ageing and cancer. Approximately half of this dose comes from X-rays, mammograms, CT scans and similar. The other, natural half occurs from radioactive compounds in soil and building materials like concrete and brick. The small amount of mineral potassium in the human body is also  radioactive. Of this natural radiation, around nine per cent comes from cosmic radiation. Particles from space interact with the atmosphere and Earth's magnetic field to generate cosmic radiation. Sources are said to include gamma ray bursts, solar flares and supernovae. It is what's known as ionising, which means particles can alter charged particles from atoms that can potentially cause chemical changes in body tissue. Exposure to this kind of radiation is more significant at higher latitudes and near the magnetic poles, and many planes take polar routes to cut journey times. This exposure is so significant that in 1994 US pilots and cabin crew were classified as 'radiation workers' and the maximum allowable yearly occupational does is 50,000 \u03bcSv. Last year researchers from the University of California found that pilots flying for an hour at 30,000ft get the same amount of radiation as 20 minutes on a tanning bed. And researchers believe the levels could be higher when pilots are flying over thick clouds and snow fields, which can reflect UV radiation . The lowest yearly dose that has been linked to an increase in cancer risk is 100,000 \u03bcSv, while a dosage of 2,000,000 \u03bcSv is considered severe and potentially fatal.",

And on Sunday director Gareth Edwards took to the stage  to reveal a few details about Rogue One, the first of the standalone Star Wars films, at the Stars Wars Celebration in Anaheim, California. At the same time, the iconic franchise's Twitter account posted a capsule of the storyline, saying: 'A band of resistance fighters unite for a daring mission to steal the Death Star plans in Star Wars anthology film, Rogue One #RogueOne.' Scroll down for video ... First look: Director Gareth Edwards revealed a glimpse of the first Star Wars spin-off Rogue One at the Star Wars Celebration convention in Anaheim, California, on Sunday . Special: Fans at a Star Wars convention in California were treated to one last surprise before the event closed . Sneak peek: A preview from a Star Wars anthology film, Rogue One was screene . Expanding the universe far, far, away: In Rogue One\u00a0'a band of resistance fighters unite for a daring mission to steal the Death Star plans' 18 months away: The film has not yet begun shooting so it's not clear if these scenes will be in the final movie . One attendee managed to capture the preview of Rogue One on their cellphone before uploading it YouTube . Following the release of the trailer to Star Wars VII, Disney's share price rocketed with more than $US2 billion added to the company's value. Star Wars has attracted generations of loyal fans ever since the first film arrived nearly 40 years ago, creating a signature moment in the history of popular culture and launching one of the biggest movie franchises ever. After a second trilogy of prequel films wrapped in 2005, the movie franchise had lain dormant until Disney shelled out $US4 billion To buy creator Lucas\u2019s Lucasfilm in October 2012. Disney soon announced plans for three new films in the series, with acclaimed Hollywood director J.J. Abrams being entrusted with the reboot. The Force isn\u2019t just returning to the big screen, it's also reappearing in video games too. Star Wars Battlefront which was first teased at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in 2013, marks the first title in a 10-year deal between the Walt Disney Co. and Electronic Arts Inc. to create new games. 'For more than 1,000 generations, the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic.\u00a0Before the dark times.\u00a0Before the Empire,' the voiceover reads, as the camera tracks to show a ghostly Death Star hovering in the clouds. Set between the third and the fourth movies in the 'Star Wars' saga, the film will follow a band of resistance fighters who unite to steal the Death Star plans and 'bring a new hope,' referring to the subtitle of the original 'Star Wars.' Gareth Edwards who directed Godzilla debuted a tantalizing concept reel to preview the mysterious film, which is part of a series of films exploring other stories outside of the core 'Star Wars' saga. Gareth is due to start work on the spin-off, starring Felicity Jones as a Rebel fighter, this summer for a December 2016 release. Aside from the storyline, he also unveiled art and a brief sizzle reel for an audience of excited fans at the fourth and final day of the event at the Anaheim Convention Centre.. Gareth was joined onstage by Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy and head of development Kiri Hart who explained: 'We really wanted freedom to do some films that could stand on their own, and tell new stories.' She added that they are describing them as 'anthology films' that expand the Star Wars universe without necessarily using the main characters. Joing the Star Wars characters: Gareth, pictured at the Godzilla premiere in Beijing last June, will start work on Rogue One this summer for a December 2016 release . More to come: The Star Wars website released this Twitter describing the storyline for the film, which is described as an anthology movie adding to the Star Wars universe . Glamour girl: Felicity Jones, pictured at the Oscars in February, will star in Rogue One . According to Gareth, Rogue One is set after Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge Of The Sith and before the original Star Wars, which became Episode IV when George Lucas created the three prequels. Gareth said Rogue One won't have clear-cut villains and heroes, according to the Hollywood Reporter. And the crowd laughed when he joked about the content, saying: 'It's called Star WARS,' putting heavy emphasis on the last word. 'It\u2019s about the fact that god\u2019s not coming to save us, and we\u2019re on our own. The absence of the Jedi is omnipresent in the film. It hangs over the whole movie,' he added. Felicity Jones, who recently garnered an Oscar nomination for her role in 'The Theory of Everything' is the only confirmed cast member for the film, which will shoot in London this summer for a December 2016 release. Edwards said that her character will not just be a stoic soldier, but a complex, fully rounded human. 'We wanted to see fear, warmth, all of those aspects that everybody has,' he said, excited that Jones embodies 'the complete package.' In the world of 'Rogue One,' Edwards said the 'absence of Jedi is omnipresent.' Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy appears on the Cantina set at Star Wars Celebration: The Ultimate Fan Experience held in Anaheim last week . The characters in the film realize that the 'gods are not coming to save us,' he said. 'It comes down to a group of people who don't have magical powers who band together to bring hope to the galaxy.' 'Cinderella' scribe Chis Weitz wrote the screenplay based on an idea from visual effects supervisor John Knoll. Josh Trank, who is set to direct the next, still untitled 'Star Wars' anthology film, did not attend the event although he was originally scheduled to appear. The idea for the film came from award-winning visual effects artist John Knoll, who pitched the idea internally before bringing it to Kathleen Kennedy and Lucasfilm's Kiri Hart. Hart, vice president of development for Lucasfilm, said that the anthology films will vary in 'scale and genre.' She added that they are describing them as 'anthology films' that expand the Star Wars universe without necessarily using the main characters. 'We wanted freedom to do some films that would be able to stand on their own and tell unique stories,' she said. 'They can still feel like `Star Wars' and be `Star Wars.' Meanwhile, it was revealed that the trailer for Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens, which debuted at the event on Thursday, was viewed 88 million times worldwide in the first 24 hours. Directed by JJ Abrams, the movie opens in the US on December 18.",

        "article": "Shelly Sterling has spoken out about her legal victory over her husband's alleged mistress V. Stiviano, saying she took the much-younger woman to court 'for justice'. The billionaire wife of former Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling said she felt vindicated by the judge's ruling this week that Stiviano, 32, must return $2.6 million in sugar daddy gifts. Donald Sterling, 80, had lavished his alleged girlfriend with gifts including a $1.8 million house, luxury cars and stocks - all while hiding them from his wife of six decades. But Shelly insisted on Wednesday she didn't take them to court over the money. Scroll down for video . Vindicated: Shelly Sterling, pictured at a Clippers game last month, will receive $2.6 million from a woman her husband Donald showered with gifts. Shelly has said she took the woman to court 'for justice' 'I did it for justice,' she said. 'I think when somebody harms you in so many ways, justice has to prevail.' Shelly Sterling said she would donate the proceeds to charity. Despite acknowledging marital problems, she also said she and her husband never separated. She said she\u00a0drafted divorce papers last year, but never filed them. The couple testified at trial last month in Los Angeles Superior Court about their love for each other, displaying cards they had exchanged. Still, Donald Sterling is suing his wife and the NBA over the $2 billion sale of the team. A year ago, a recording of Donald Sterling telling Stiviano not to associate with black people led the NBA to ban him for life and fine him $2.5 million. His wife then negotiated a deal to sell the team with ex-Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer after doctors found Donald Sterling incompetent to handle his business affairs. Together: Donald Sterling is pictured with V. Stiviano in 2011 as they watch the Clippers play. He lost the team last year after a recording emerged in which he told Stiviano not to be seen with black people . Shelly added on Wednesday that she mourns the loss of the team. 'It was a horrible thing to go through,' she said. 'They were like my family. To this day I still feel very bad about it.' Her husband's lawyer on Wednesday criticized her lawsuit as a 'pet project' that had extended Stiviano's time in the spotlight. 'The sums spent by Shelly Sterling in pursuing this matter likely exceeds any amount that will be recovered,' attorney Bobby Samini said. 'We remain perplexed that so much time, energy and money have been allocated to litigating with Ms. Stiviano.' Shelly Sterling's attorney scoffed at that statement. 'What do you expect from the lawyer for a husband who was caught red-handed gifting his mistress with millions of dollars of family money,' Pierce O'Donnell said. In court: Stiviano, pictured heading to court last month, accepted gifts worth $2.6 million from the older man and has now been ordered to hand them back over. The exact nature of their relationship was never clear . Shelly Sterling had filed the suit against Stiviano a month before the recording of her husband telling Stiviano not to associate with black people created an uproar and led the NBA to ban him for life. In court, Shelly Sterling's lawyers used other recordings from Stivian's iPhone to show he bought his alleged mistress a house, a Ferrari and other things. Stiviano and the 80-year-old billionaire were heard discussing how to shield gifts from his wife. 'The truth is that everything that I have, you've given me from your heart without me begging or asking or throwing myself all over you,' Stiviano said in snippet played in court. During the course of their two and a half years together, Sterling gave her a Ferrari, a Bentley and a Range Rover, and paid the lion's share of a $1.8 million duplex. Sterling testified that he paid for the house, though Stiviano said she had contributed an unknown amount of money given to her in small bills by family members that she saved in a bedroom drawer. But Judge Richard Fruin Jr. said this claim was 'not believable' and he relied instead on a recording in which she told Donald Sterling: 'I want Shelly to know you bought me the house.' Still smiling: Stiviano, pictured showing off her new braces, was seen out in Los Angeles earlier this month . He ruled earlier this week that Stiviano must now turn over the keys to the $1.8 million house and pay Shelly Sterling some $800,000 that her husband showered on the younger woman in gifts. It was Stiviano who recorded the now-infamous conversation with Sterling in which he berated her for associating with black people and urged her not to bring minorities with her to Clippers games. In the subsequent furor, the NBA banned Sterling from the league for life, and he was ultimately forced to sell the Clippers franchise he had owned for 33 years for a record $2 billion. The recording was leaked weeks after Shelly Sterling sued Stiviano, alleging she was her husband's mistress but the exact nature of their relationship was never clear. Stiviano called him a lover and father figure but said they never had sex. Donald Sterling called her an 'ex-friend' on the witness stand, though he said in recordings that he loved her and wanted to give her everything.",

        "article": "An Ohio police officer who jumped on the hood of a car and fired the final 15 rounds of a 137-shot barrage that killed a pair of unarmed suspects is claiming that he doesn't remember doing it. Michael Brelo goes on trial on Monday charged with\u00a0two counts of voluntary manslaughter for the deaths of Timothy Russell, 43, and Malissa Williams, 30. He is the lone officer among the 13 who fired their weapons that night who is charged criminally because prosecutors say he stood on the hood and opened fire four seconds after the other officers had stopped shooting. A rookie cop told the same investigators Michael Brelo spoke with that the 31-year-old Cleveland officer talked about it in the days after the November 2012 shooting. Brelo's footprints were also found on the hood of the beat-up Chevy Malibu where  Russell, 43, and Williams, 30, died. Scroll down for video . Cleveland officer Michael Brelo is facing charges after two unarmed suspects were killed in this  Chevy Malibu . Brelo faces two voluntary manslaughter charges after firing the final 15 rounds of the deadky 137-shot barrage . Malissa Williams (left) and Timothy Russell (right) were both unarmed when they were killed in November 2012 . The car was strafed by police gunfire and its two unarmed occupants were killed after a high-speed chase over streets and freeways in and around Cleveland. When Brelo was questioned by investigators two weeks after the shooting, he told them he didn't recall what happened. He said: 'It's possible because I was so terrified that I was going to get run over.' 'But I don't recall that, sir.' Rookie officer Brian Sabolik \u00a0who was assigned to the same district as Brelo, told investigators he stopped firing after 'someone' jumped on the hood of the Malibu. Officer Sabolik said he later learned it was Brelo. Asked how he found out, Sabolik said: 'Because [Brelo] was talking about it.' While Brelo claimed not to remember jumping on the hood, prosecutors have evidence to show that he did. Investigators from the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation found footprints on the hood of the Malibu that matched a set found on the trunk and roof of a police car that Brelo had climbed on top of to fire from behind the light bar. Brelo is currently suspended. Photos released by the Office of the Ohio Attorney General show a Cleveland cruiser sitting next to the Chevy . Brelo goes on trial Monday on two counts of voluntary manslaughter for the deaths of Russell and Williams. He is the lone officer among the 13 who fired their weapons that night who is charged criminally because prosecutors say he stood on the hood and opened fire four seconds after the other officers had stopped shooting. A judge - not a jury - will decide whether Brelo is guilty or innocent. He faces a maximum sentence of 25 years if convicted. Brelo's defense team has argued that all 49 rounds Brelo fired that night, including the last 15, were lawful. The threat from the pair didn't end until Brelo reached into the Malibu and removed the keys to prevent the suspects from using the car as a weapon, according to his defense. Russell and Williams were each shot more than 20 times. The chase started with a failed traffic stop on the edge of downtown by a plainclothes detective who never reported to dispatchers that he'd lost sight of the vehicle. Russell then sped past Cleveland police headquarters, where his car backfired. Officers and witnesses standing outside were certain they'd heard gunshots and a police radio call for shots fired triggered an adrenaline-fueled rush by officers to join the chase. Brelo and his partner were two of the first officers to join the pursuit that ultimately included more than 60 police cars, 104 officers and reached at least 100mph. In this forensics picture, bullet trajectories from the deadly shooting are marked off on the Chevy Malibu . After driving into a school parking lot more than 20 minutes after the chase began, Russell turned the car around and tried to flee again - sideswiping a cruiser before coming to a stop. Another officer, who said he feared for his life, opened fire, prompting others including Brelo to do the same. Brelo and his partner fired 15 rounds through their own windshield and told investigators they saw dark objects in Russell's and Williams' hands. Brelo said he left his cruiser because he said he was afraid the Malibu would hit him, even though he then crossed in front of the car to climb on top of another cruiser and open fire again. He told investigators:\u00a0'I had leapt trying to get out of the way of this car so it doesn't run me over and kill me.' Investigators found footprints on the hood of the Malibu (left) that matched a set found on the trunk and roof of a police car (right) that Brelo had climbed on top of to fire from behind the light bar . Investigators eventually concluded that neither Russell nor Williams had a gun. An exhaustive search was conducted along the route of the pursuit, including the use of a dive team to look in bodies of water, but no gun was ever found. Regardless of the trial's outcome, the after-effects of the chase and shooting will likely endure for years to come. The incident helped spur a US Justice Department probe that concluded Cleveland police officers have shown a pattern and practice of using excessive force. The city and federal authorities are negotiating a consent decree to reform the police department that will cost the city millions of dollars to implement and enforce. Cleveland has already paid $3million to the families of Russell and Williams to settle a lawsuit.",

'I want to go one step further and give them a picture of their baby, their boyfriend, or their favourite cartoon character. If that makes them happy, that makes them smile, that's cool.' According to the Mr Yonzon, the biggest challenge he faces is to get the picture etched into the froth before it dissolves and the coffee turns cold.

The maker of Clorox bleach and other products says it was attempting a humorous reference to other emoji symbols for objects like toilets and bathtubs that people use bleach to clean. But the corporate Twitter post hit a nerve when news reports and online discussions were focusing on the new collection of racially diverse faces that have been added to the symbols people can use in emails and text messages. On Twitter, some users blasted the company for what they said was a 'racist' post. Controversy:\u00a0Clorox has apologized  after the company sparked outrage by tweeting 'where's the bleach' in reference to last week's introduction of new 'emoji' cartoons for iPhones that include several faces of people with black and brown skin . @whitleyslilcuz wrote '@Clorox Save yourself the drama trying to defend this racist azz tweet. Just delete it.' '@Clorox racist won't buy your products anymore,' @IamHaydeee wrote. Per CNNMoney, @DriNicole tweeted '@Clorox Why is the tweet still there? You need to clean up your PR person. Put some bleach on your distasteful marketing ideas.' Other users disagreed, expressing their thoughts on social media. WPIX producer Ashley Alese Edwards, under the handle @AshleyAlese, tweeted 'Not sure how the Clorox tweet was racist? People need to stop reaching.' 'If you're offended by Clorox's tweet, just get off of social media and look for actual racism elsewhere. #IHatePeopleSometimes,' @PeytonsHead tweeted. @KyleBalan tweeted '@Clorox this wasn't racist. I agree we need a bleach emoji.' Apology: Clorox later tried to make amends in a different Tweet . Uproar:\u00a0The gaffe is only the latest example of companies like AT&T and Kenneth Cole that have sparked controversy or offense on social media . 'I didn't think it was malicious, but impact negates intent. This is someone being thoughtless, and really not focused on what was trending that day,' said Jazzmen Knoderer, a 29-year-old program coordinator at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. She joined other Twitter users in posting her dismay about the Clorox tweet after it spread online last week. Clorox, based in Oakland, California, tried to make amends with another post that said, 'Wish we could bleach away our last tweet. Didn't mean to offend.' The company also apologized in a statement Saturday that added, 'We did not mean for this to be taken as a specific reference to the diversity emojis - but we should have been more aware of the news around this. The tweet was meant to be light-hearted - about having an emoji shaped like a bleach bottle to represent doing laundry or cleaning - but it fell flat.' The gaffe is only the latest example of companies like AT&T and Kenneth Cole that have sparked controversy or offense on social media.

        "article": "A 116-year-old Arkansas woman passed away on Monday just six days after she was announced as the oldest living person in the world. Last week Gertrude Weaver, who was already the oldest person in America, asked President Barack Obama to attend her birthday party on the Fourth of July. The Silver Oaks Health and Rehabilitation Center in Camden, where Weaver was a resident, confirmed her death and said they were 'devastated by her loss'. Scroll down for video . Gertrude Weaver, the world's oldest person, died at 116 on Monday in Camden, Arkansas . Weaver passed away from complications due to pneumonia, according to KATV. Kathy Langley, the center's administrator, said Weaver was enjoying the spotlight she received in the last week of her life, she told\u00a0Reuters. The staff read Weaver the many news articles written about her after she became the oldest person in the world. Weaver inherited the title last Wednesday, after the death of 117-year-old Misao Okawa in Japan, according to the Los Angeles-based Gerontology Research Group. She attributed her long life to treating others well and eating her own cooking. 'I treat everyone the way I want to be treated,' she told reporters. Weaver, who received a letter from Obama on her 116th birthday, said she wanted to meet the president at her birthday party because she voted for him twice. Weaver attributed her long life to treating others well and eating her own cooking . While living at Silver Oaks, Weaver exercised in her wheelchair three times a week and ate three meals a day at the facility's dining room. Weaver was born on July 4, 1898 in Arkansas. She was the daughter of sharecroppers and worked as a domestic helper. After retiring, she lived with her granddaughter. Weaver moved to Silver Oaks in 2009 when her granddaughter had health problems, according to Langley, who called her an 'absolutely amazing lady'. Weaver became the world's oldest person on Wednesday following the death of Misao Okawa in Japan(left) who died at the age of 117. American Jeralean Talley, 115, (right) is now the world's oldest person . Weaver's 93-year-old son visited her on a regular basis. Jeralean Talley, of Detroit, is now the world's oldest person, according to the Gerontology Research Group. Talley was born on May 23, 1899 and will turn 116 next month. She bowled until she was 104 years old and never smoked or drank alcohol. The only surgery Talley said she ever had was to get her tonsils removed, according to Reuters.

        "article": "Councils are pocketing thousands in change by forcing drivers to overpay for parking\u00a0because their meters  do not accept five or 10 pence coins brought in three years ago. Town halls   have failed to recalibrate some of the 100,000 ticket machines in the UK - making it impossible for drivers to pay the exact cost of parking. In Manchester, where 240 machines are still not upgraded, motorists\u00a0without old-style coins\u00a0must use \u00a31 and two 20p pieces for a typical \u00a31.25 hour's parking - handing the council a 15p profit. Big profit:\u00a0Town hall bosses in Manchester have been accused of pocketing thousands of pounds extra from 240 parking ticket machines in the city because they still do not accept new 5p and 10p pieces . The council also charges \u00a31.85 for an hour and a half and \u00a33.10 for two hours and 30 minutes, meaning that drivers without the right coins must overpay for them too. Nationwide there are 100,000 parking meters yet several councils are still yet to upgrade them to accept the three-year-old 5p and 10p coins. Many local authorities don't use machines that offer change because they could become targets for theft. Experts fear the problem could become even worse when the new 12-sided pound coin is released in 2017. This is because their hourly charges often end in 5p and 10p yet the machines do not accept new five or 10p coins, making it impossible for drivers to pay the exact fee. Manchester drivers have demanded refunds and want to know why the council is yet to upgrade its machines. Darren Edwards, 42, was forced to overpay for his parking as the machine could not take the correct change. He said: 'I know it is not much but if you think how often those parking spots are used, and if everyone is over paying that soon adds up.' Coin chaos: The 5p and 10p pieces introduced three years ago are slightly thicker than the old ones, which means that a considerable number of machines still reject them . The parking machine he used currently charges of \u00a31.25 for an hour's parking, \u00a31.85 for an hour and a half and \u00a33.10 for two hours and 30 minutes. But a sticker says it will not accept the new silver coins. The new thicker nickel-plated steel coins were introduced in 2012 by the Royal Mint and since then, 330million are in circulation while older copper-nickel coins have been steadily recalled. Industry chiefs insist the bill for converting parking meters, vending machines and phone boxes to accept the new \u00a31 coin could be more than \u00a3200million. The 12-sided coin, which resembles a classic threepenny bit, was announced as a way to fight a surge in the number of \u00a31 in circulation - a racket that costs the economy some \u00a345million a year. But roughly 1.2million machines on the market will have to be re-calibrated to fit the new piece, which is set to be introduced in 2017, according to one industry expert. Payphones, parking metres, betting shop fruit machines, launderette washing machines and supermarket trolleys are among the devices that will need to be upgraded. Last year the Royal Mint suggested that the cost of converting these machines would be around \u00a320million. But company chiefs have today disputed the amount - calculating that it could me more than five times as much. Jonathan Hilder, CEO of the Automatic Vending Association, estimated that forgeries make up some 3.03 per cent of the more than 1.5billion \u00a31 coins in circulation. He said that increasingly sophisticated technology meant that coins were easier to fake - and that 50 per cent of these counterfeit coins successfully passed through vending machines. The new coin  will be made from two types of metal, like the current \u00a32 coin. A Freedom of Information request to Manchester council revealed the town hall made \u00a314.8m from car parking in 2013/14. Coun Luthfur Rahman, the council's assistant executive member for environment, said: 'We are in the process of re-calibrating all the pay and display machines to accept the new 5p and 10p coins. 'This will be completed by the end of the month. 'There is also an alternative payment method - Pay by Phone - which doesn't require correct change as the tariff is charged directly to the customer's credit or debit card via their mobile phone. 'This cashless method also allows customers to purchase further parking time, up to the maximum permitted, with no need to return to the pay and display machine, as well as providing text reminders when their parking time is about to expire.' In recent years drivers have complained about similar problems in towns and cities all over the UK. Councils in Sheffield, Brighton, Telford, Hull and in Edinburgh are among many who admitted to problems. The vending industry said updating machines could local authorities as much as \u00a3100million to modify parking meters and called the coin charges 'a disaster'. Because of the cost of changing machines, or having machines able to give change, councils are encouraging people to pay in other ways. A spokesman for the British Parking Association said: 'Mobile phone technology is beginning to revolutionise the way parking is paid for and offers more flexibility than static coin machines. 'Parking providers are already offering other cashless payment methods including credit cards and pre-booking. Some smart phone apps allow motorists to scan QR codes on signage instead of feeding a machine, all of which cut time, offer variety and ease of payment'.",

        "article": "A former TV pitchman in Utah known for his over-the-top personality pleaded guilty to harassing a barn owl in flight while on a motorized paraglider. Dell 'Super Dell' Schanze, 45, was sentenced to one year of probation on Friday after pleading guilty to\u00a0two misdemeanor counts, knowingly using an aircraft to harass wildlife and pursuing a migratory bird, according to the Salt Lake Tribune. His admission of guilt follows a plea deal that fell through on Thursday after he refused to admit to the 2011 crime which he said makes him look like an evil, horrible person. However, he returned to a federal court on Friday to plead guilty. Schanze was scheduled to go to trial on April 20 and would have faced a maximum of one year in federal prison and more than $100,000 in fines if convicted. Dell 'Super Dell' Schanze arrives for a court appearance at the federal courthouse on Thursday, April 9, 2015 in Salt Lake City where a plea deal fell through because he refused to admit to the 2011 crime. On Friday, he returned to the court to plead guilty . On Friday, Schanze pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor counts, knowingly using an aircraft to harass wildlife and pursuing a migratory bird . 'There was no plea agreement, and federal prosecutors made no concessions to Schanze as a part of his guilty plea to both counts,' according to a statement from the U.S. Attorney's Office, KSL reported. The charges, filed in October 2014, came after a federal investigation into a video that surfaced online in 2013. It appeared to show a paraglider near Utah Lake kicking a soaring owl and boasting about it. In a statement released from the attorney's it said Schanze will forfeit an orange parasail as a substitute asset for the paraglider involved in the illegal conduct. 'Judge Benson also ordered him not to land a paraglider in a federally designated Wilderness Area or in any area closed to motorized access by a federal agency,' the statement said. On Thursday, Schanze who is known in Utah for his shrill, hyperactive TV commercials for his Totally Awesome Computers retail chain, yet again turned a court hearing into a spectacle. It started when he arrived about five minutes late and entered court wearing dark sunglasses, a tight-fitting black turtleneck, tennis shoes and a fanny pack. When U.S. District Judge Dee Benson began reading through the plea deal, Schanze answered 'yes sir' to the first few questions but then balked after Benson asked him if it was true that he knowingly harassed the owl in 2011. Schanze was sentenced to one year of probation and has to forfeit an orange parasail as a substitute asset for the paraglider involved in the illegal conduct (above Schanze pictured in May 2006) Schanze responded 'No sir.' 'I'm going to go out on a limb here, what part isn't true?' Benson said. 'Pretty much all of it, but I'm willing to plea to it if we can finish this today,' Schanze said. The judge explained to Schanze that he could not accept a plea deal without an admission to the facts. His attorney, Kent Hart, spoke with him several times and the judge at one point brought both attorneys to the bench. 'Do you not see the conundrum?' Schanze told the judge. 'I'm not an evil, horrible guy and I'm not going to lie.' Schanze never budged refusing to accept the facts, and\u00a0Benson ended the hearing and ordered the case to trial beginning on April 20 before he pleaded guilty on Friday. Thursday was also not the first time Schanze has made a sideshow out of a court hearing. At his initial appearance in December, he was handcuffed and briefly held in contempt after being disruptive and combative with a federal judge. During that hearing, he was placed in handcuffs in a Salt Lake City courtroom after he stood up and interrupted a judge at another man's hearing. U.S. Chief Magistrate Judge Brooke Wells had told that man he would have to surrender any weapons as part of his release. Speaking loudly from the front row, Schanze declared it was unconstitutional to take the man's guns. Wells ordered U.S. marshals to handcuff Schanze and escort him out. Charges against Schanze came in 2014 after a federal investigation into a video that surfaced online in 2013 and appeared to show a paraglider near Utah Lake kicking a soaring owl and boasting about it . Schanze is known in Utah for his shrill, hyperactive TV commercials for his Totally Awesome Computers retail chain . In 2006, Schanze shut down his Totally Awesome Computers stores amid sinking sales and legal troubles. He has since run for political office, including a Libertarian bid for governor. Schanze's paragliding has run afoul of the law before. In 2006, he was charged with disorderly conduct after flying low near Interstate 15 at rush hour. He kissed the feet of a fan who paid his $300 fine in the case. Five years later, Schanze was arrested in Oregon after allegedly jumping off the 125-foot-tall Astoria Column. He said outside the jail the government was stifling his creativity. His other legal troubles include a 2005 conviction for lying to officers after prosecutors said he brandished a gun at Draper residents angry that he'd sped through their neighborhood. Four years later, Schanze was sentenced to ten days in jail after police stopped him for weaving in and out of traffic. Prosecutors say his children weren't wearing seatbelts, and Schanze was carrying a loaded gun in his fanny pack without a permit.

So, when a woman is granted Victoria's Secret Angel wings, she's deemed something special and the future begins to look pretty bright. The lingerie giant this week added ten new Angels to its coveted roster and one lucky Brit made the cut. So who is Stella Maxwell and how did she make the transition from diplomat's daughter to one of the world's sexiest women? Scroll down for video . Stella Maxwell, who is Irish but now splits her time between Los Angeles and New York, was this week unveiled as one of ten new Victoria's Secret Angels . Stella, 24, was born to Northern Irish parents Stella Maynes and Maurice Maxwell, who worked as a diplomat. She was born in Belgium and was raised there until she was 13. In one of her many moves, her family relocated to Canberra, Australia, then Wellington, New Zealand thanks to her father's job. The 5ft 9in beauty was discovered at Otago University and started her modelling career. She has since gone on to land coveted campaigns for the likes of ASOS, Alexander McQueen, H&M, River Island and Urban Outfitters, as well as Vogue and ELLE editorials. Stella was born to Irish parents Stella Maynes and Maurice Maxwell, who worked as a diplomat, and has lived all over the world thanks to her father's job . Stella, left, on the pink carpet of the 2014 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show in December 2014 in London and, right, on the VS runway in the world famous show . Stella was born in Belgium and was raised there until she was 13 before she moved around the world . Speaking to V magazine about her career to date, she said: 'The VS show was such a big show for me and my career. It was really cool to be involved. It's kind of wild to check out the scene. Walking Marc Jacobs was pretty cool, too. And I always love walking for Jeremy Scott.' The young model, who now splits her time between New York and Los Angeles, loves racket sports, hiking and travel. When she isn't keeping fit or modelling, she spends her time hanging out with best friend Barbara Palvin (who was rumoured to be dating One Direction's Niall Horan), and global megastar, Miley Cyrus. Stella and Miley Cyrus, left, travelled to Las Vegas together last month - and Stella documented the trip, which included private planes and pool parties, on her Instagram account .

Speaking to V Magazine about the friendship, Stella said: 'We met through mutual friends via Instagram. It's been a trip to hang out and see a little of their world. Felt very organic and right.' Despite her high-profile friendships, the Irish Independent reports that Stella's favourite things are the 'simple' ones in life, such as roadtrips with friends, vintage clothing and playing scrabble on her iPhone. The young model, who has over 500k followers on Instagram, told Vogue: 'Victoria\u2019s Secret - they are a privilege to work for; they appreciate your beauty. I think they are one of the few companies that celebrate the girl for being the girl, they really use you as a brand and show you off. 'Your personality counts for a lot and how you are to work with. Once you get to know them, it gets really comfortable - after all, at the end of the day, you are in your underwear.' The well-connected star is good friends with Blurred Lines model and Gone Girl actress Emily\u00a0Ratajkowski .

        "article": "A man has made the infamous shepherds pie-trifle combination of custard, jam and meat immortalised in popular TV show Friends. On the show hapless character Rachel decided to treat her loved ones to what she mistakenly thought was 'a traditional English trifle' layered with all the trimmings - including\u00a0ladyfingers, jam, custard, beef saut\u00e9ed with peas and onions, a little more custard, bananas and some whipped cream. Now one brave Mancunian has whipped up their own version of the unusual concoction - replacing the beef with the far more traditional lamb. Scroll down for video . Neil Killham made the infamous shepherds pie-trifle combination immortalised on Friends 16 years ago. It features sponge, jam, custard, lamb, peas, onions, whipped cream and is garnished with sprinkles . Neil Killham, a 32-year-old software engineer from Manchester, announced his plans on Twitter with a picture of his clashing ingredients with the caption: 'It's finally time. I'm making The Trifle Out Of Friends.' Giving a running commentary on the social media site, Neil proudly showed off the finished masterpiece which actually looked very respectable - until he cut into it. He told his followers that while it does not taste like feet - as characters on the show claimed - it was still 'f****** horrible'. He added: 'But with enough nice trifle stuff that we keeping eating more of it.' The trifle-shepherds pie combination did not look quite as appetising once it had been sliced into . Friends character Rachel Green (played by Jennifer Aniston) accidentally made the disgusting dessert . Neil posted this picture of a friend attempting a second go at the trifle pie - it doesn't appear to have improved . 'I thought I'd be able to compartmentalise the clashing flavours, but I cannot.' When MailOnline asked how it tasted, Neil, who shared the dish with friends, said: 'It tasted terrible of course - but not so bad that I couldn't finish my slice. 'It's the way you sometimes think you've got lucky and got a nice pure trifle bite and then pow! Lamb!' He said in the last year he has made curry flavoured cupcakes, a chilli cheesecake and a pancake pizza, among other things. 'Usually they kind of work, so I figured it was time to try something that definitely wouldn't,' he said. 'Although when I tried sprouts in marmite that didn't work either, but it wasn't as bad as this. 'A couple of people tried it with me last night and agreed it was terrible.\u00a0Opinions were mixed on whether the lamb or the onion was the biggest problem. 'Then a couple of people at work also tried it and came to similar conclusions. 'Except for one guy who said \"it wasn't that bad really. Not good, but not the worst\". 'I'm not sure I can trust him any more.' The trifle looked distinctly unappetising when dished up on a plate - and apparently tasted even worse . In the show the dessert was described as half trifle, half shepherd's pie after two pages in the English cookery book Rachel was using stuck together - but the creators mistakenly used beef instead of the lamb which is traditional in the pie. Towards the end of the season six episode the penny finally drops and Rachel says: 'I wasn't supposed to put beef in the trifle!' If for some reason you would like to recreate this Heston Blumenthal-esque clash of flavours and textures, the recipe would appear to be: A layer of sponge, layer of jam, layer of custard, layer of raspberries, another layer of sponge, layer of lamb saut\u00e9ed with peas and onions, a bit more custard, banana, and a topping of whipped cream garnished with hundreds and thousands .",

        "article": "Neil Robertson revealed a new practice repertoire which he hopes will lift him among the game's all-time greats after storming into the second round of the Betfred World Championship. The 2010 champion rattled in an opening break of 133 as he reeled off the three frames required to turn a 7-2 lead into a 10-2 victory over Welshman Jamie Jones in Sheffield. Robertson has committed more hours to the game than ever before and he believes it will help him finally fulfil his potential and become a multiple winner of the sport's major crowns. Australia's Neil Robertson plays a shot during his  match against Wales's Jamie Jones at The Crucible . 'I have put in more hours for this tournament than any other in my whole career,' the 33-year-old Australian said. 'Before I played my first-round match I potted 300 balls without missing - that's the stuff (Stephen) Hendry used to do. Hendry used to not miss for six or seven frames, and that's what you have to do if you want to dominate matches. 'If you were to stop my career and look back, I would definitely have a feeling of 'what if I had practised more?'. I think I could do more so I've left no stone unturned coming into this tournament. 'It would be harsh to say I have under-achieved, but I think I could have won a lot more if I'd sacrificed a little bit more.' Barry Hawkins found himself the reluctant star of another Crucible epic after clinging on to beat qualifier Matthew Selt in a final-frame decider. The 2013 finalist looked set to ease through to the last 16 after resuming on Monday with a 7-2 overnight lead which he extended to 9-4 to move within one frame of victory. Robertson celebrates winning in his World Snooker Championship first round match against Wales's Jones . But Selt responded by reeling off five frames in a row - including back-to-back centuries - before a cool clearance from Hawkins saw him into the second round with a 10-9 win. Hawkins - who fought off a similar fightback from Dominic Dale in last year's quarter-finals, admitted: 'I can't keep putting myself through that. 'There's nothing worse than when someone is coming back at you like that and you can see your lead disappearing. Robertson contemplates a shot during his World Snooker Championship first round match at The Crucible . 'You're telling yourself it's only one frame but you can see him growing in confidence and potting long balls so it is a horrible place to be.' Ding Junhui's dismal record at the Crucible looked set to continue as he lost the first four frames of his first-round match against veteran Mark Davis. The world number three looked distinctly out of sorts in the early stages, but clawed his way back to reduce the deficit to 3-4 overnight.",

Smokey Da Lamb has been turning heads in some of the city's coolest neighborhoods ever since restaurant owner Sandy Dee Hall, 34, and his girlfriend Maxine Cher, 24, adopted him. But now the couple - and Smokey's impressive legion of fans - have been left devastated after city officials demanded he is taken out of the metropolis. Scroll down for video . Happy family:\u00a0Restaurant owner Sandy Dee Hall, 34 (R), and his girlfriend Maxine Cher, 24 (L), adopted Smokey Da Lamb after he was abandoned by his mother . Lamb and the City: Smokey has made dozens of friends during his month-long stay in New York, however city officials are now demanding that he be sent back to live on the farm . At home: The young lamb has been living with Sandy in his Lower East Side apartment, and the couple have been providing him with round-the-clock care and attention . 'Unfortunately Smokey has got to go back to the farm \u2013 we're not allowed to keep a lamb in the city,' Maxine said. 'I'll be sad to see him go because he's so loving but we're officially adopting him which means he will never end up on a dinner plate. 'We'll visit as often as we can \u2013 Sandy has even taken lamb off the menu at his restaurant The Black Tree, in tribute to Smokey. 'Smokey has caused a few disasters while he's been here but he's a farmyard animal so it's to be expected. 'We're still going to miss him hugely.' Devotion: Maxine (pictured) and Sandy bottle-feed Smokey three times a day and have to burp him after he has eaten . Friendly face: Smokey has been growing quickly since arriving in the city - and is much more confident than he was when he first moved into Sandy's apartment . Accidents do happen: Maxine admitted that Smokey is a bit like a 'dog which has not been potty trained' She added: 'Everybody should own a lamb \u2013 he is great and so loving. 'I guess he's like a dog which has not been potty trained.' Smokey was born at Violet Hill Farm in upstate New York but was abandoned by his mother and would have likely died in the cold. Fortunately Sandy, who runs Manhattan-based restaurant Black Tree, agreed to take him in when contacted by the farmer and Smokey was smuggled into his tiny apartment in the city's Lower East Side . 'Sandy told me that he had adopted a lamb and I said he was crazy \u2013 we couldn't look after a lamb,' Maxine explained. Something for everyone: The couple believe that everybody should get the chance to own a lamb . Crazy: When Sandy first told Maxine that he had adopted a lamb from a farm in upstate New York, she admits she thought the idea was ridiculous . Change of heart: 'When I saw him my heart melted,' Maxine admits . Keep clean: In addition to his regular bottle feeds, Maxine and Sandy have to bathe Smokey regularly, ensuring that they only use water so that his fleece doesn't shrink . 'But when I saw him my heart melted - he was so cute. 'He must have been around 3 or 4 pounds and was wearing a little diaper with his tail sticking out. He was so sweet and loving.' Smokey is bottle-fed three times a day and needs to be burped like a baby after he has had his formula. He needs regular baths and can only be washed with water so his fleece does not shrink. Maxine added: 'We take him out for regular walks in the park \u2013 he really loves that. Restaurant revolution: Since adopting Smokey, Sandy has removed all lamb dishes from the menu at his Manhattan restaurant,\u00a0Black Tree . Take a seat: Often Smokey will spend time with restaurant-goers, keeping them entertained while they wait for their food . Fan club: The people of New York have quickly fallen in love with Smokey's charming personality . Let me take a selfie! Smokey has quickly become a social media star; almost everyone who meets him wants to snap a picture with the popular pet . 'Smokey never needs a lead because he just likes to follow us around. 'In many ways he's better than a dog but I've never known a dog that needs to be bottle fed \u2013 or who poops and pees so much. 'Whenever I stay at Sandy's apartment I will sleep in the bed and Sandy will sleep in the living room with Smokey. 'We can't let him in the bedroom because he will make a big mess in there. 'People in the city love him, it's hard to get too far when you have Smokey with you. They'll do double takes then run back to stroke him and take pictures \u2013 he's so popular.'",

That is after Crystal Palace, managed by Alan Pardew, beat Manchester City 2-1 at Selhurst Park on Monday night, the English manager's ninth win  in South London since leaving his role at Newcastle at the end of December. His former club have since plummeted in the Premier League while Palace now find themselves threatening the top half, and combining his records at both clubs this season would see 'Team Pardew' sit in eighth place, just five points behind Southampton. Alan Pardew could be a candidate for manager of the year with his record at Newcastle and Crystal Palace . The Premier League table with Team Pardew in - as well as a team complied from pre/post Pardew results . Newcastle fans were calling for Pardew's head for many years, seen as owner Mike Ashley's puppet, and were sitting in 10th place when the 53-year-old returned 'home' to Crystal Palace. The Eagles were in the relegation zone along with Burnley and Leicester City, struggling to pick up points following Neil Warnock's sacking. But while John Carver has picked up just nine points in his 12 games in charge at St James' Park, Pardew's Palace now have 39 points and are comfortably above the drop zone. A team compiled with Newcastle and Crystal Palace's stats pre/post Pardew would be sitting in 19th (albeit with 22 Premier League clubs now technically involved). A top-half finish is now the aim for Pardew and his men, as Toon supporters still fear relegation following a 1-0 derby defeat to Sunderland on Easter Sunday. Pardew celebrates with his Newcastle team and Moussa SIssoko after his goal against QPR in November . Newcastle fans hold a banner calling the removal of Pardew in a Premier League game at Stoke in September . John Carver's Toon side are not safe from relegation yet after a 1-0 defeat at the hands of Sunderland . It all started with a 4-0 win at Dover Athletic in the FA Cup and now Crystal Palace have won four in five, most recently beating the champions. His stock will continue to rise with this table, which would put him just six points adrift of Liverpool in fifth. Pardew has recently insisted he would perform at a top club, better than Monday's counterpart Manuel Pellegrini at least, while he is definitely a contender for Premier League Manager of the Year award.

Elena Klimova managed to track down the social media accounts of many of her trolls, and has posted their vile messages along with candid photos of each sender (pictured) to a Russian website called VKontakte .

'You f*****g animal, delete your f*****g LGBT group,' one man wrote to Elena, which she rather poignantly posted with a photo of said man holding an outstretched cat (pictured) 'As beautiful people write to me often, this album will be continually updated,' Klimova wrote on her VKontakte page, according to\u00a0Buzzfeed. 'It was created for the enjoyment of contrasts and the diversity of life.' The name of Elena's group, Children 404, is a reference to the 'page not found' online error notice and Russia\u2019s law banning 'gay propaganda' among minors. One of the website's slogans is 'LGBT Teens: We Exist.' Another message, this time from a man named Dmitry, referred to homosexuals as 'libidinous f****** perverts'. In Dmitry's photo, he is seen with his arm affectionately around the shoulders of a female companion. This woman (pictured) wrote, 'Hello, Lena. My f*g brother... is one of your friends online. He will never be accepted by anyone in our family as a f*g, so he can sit and shut up' Elena dubbed the album, 'Beautiful People And The Things They Say To Me' Another message (pictured), this time from a man named Dmitry (right), referred to homosexuals as 'libidinous f****** perverts' Another troll wrote: 'You think you\u2019re helping anything with this holy crusade?? Go and f****** kill yourself before they come for you!!! People like you should be locked up!' Several people called Elena 'disgusting' and said she would 'burn in hell' for supporting the rights of the LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) community. Although homosexual relationships in Russia were decriminalised in 1993, discrimination still runs rampant. In June 2013, Russian lawmakers in Moscow passed a new law banning the 'propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships' to minors.

The radical group of women boisterously shout religious slogans, praising Islam and re-iterating their devotion to jihad . The women appear to struggle with the weight of their machine guns and make a number of basic rifle mistakes. One of the women is filmed hurriedly running up to a mound of sandbags, her burqa blowing heavily in the strong breeze. With the magazine of the machine gun incorrectly resting unevenly on a pile of old sandbags, the female jihadi fires off five rounds before being ushered away to allow another woman to practice. Many of the women also seem surprised by the powerful recoil of the rifle, taking just a couple of shots before returning to the group. Standing awkwardly in a group, many of the women appear to carelessly place the rifle butt on the ground whilst others appear to be leaning on their weapons.

Most of the women appear to be wearing white sports shoes or unflattering\u00a0sandals\u00a0and shoes. Standing to attention, the unit of female jihadis sloppily hold their rifles by their sides, awaiting the commands of their self-appointed officer. Many of the women seem surprised by the powerful recoil of the rifle, taking just a couple of shots before returning to the group. The training group are filmed from different angles, including close up shots of the female fighters. Formed up in an informal parade square, the group stand to attention, lazily holding their guns down by their side. One of the women, who seems to be the enthusiastic leader of the group stands at the front, leading the loud call and response chants in Arabic. They\u00a0boisterously\u00a0shot religious slogans, praising the  Islamic State and re-iterating their devotion to jihad.

Marie Hunt of Spring Green, Wisconsin, had to drop out of school after completing eighth grade when she found herself unable to get to her local high school,which was located six miles away from her home. Now a resident at Meadows Assisted Living and Memory Care in Spring Green, the\u00a0centenarian was presented with an honorary degree by\u00a0River Valley High School, 87 years after her fellow classmates graduated. Never too late: 103-year-old Marie Hunt received an honorary high school diploma 87 years after she would have graduated . 'I was born in 1911, and there was no way that country kids six miles away could go to high school,'\u00a0she said, adding that instead she stayed at home and helped to take care of her eight younger siblings. When she expressed that she always regretted not graduating, her hospice nurse contacted the local high school to see if they could make Ms. Hunt's dreams come true. 'It's something I always wanted, and I didn't have the opportunity to go. And now, a hundred years later, here I am,' she told ABC's WKOW\u00a0on her graduation day,\u00a087 years after her classmates graduated in 1928.

A different time: Born in 1911, Ms. Hunt didn't have easy access to transportation to commute to school . Friends, family, and fellow residents at her assisted living center were on hand to watch her walk in her black cap and gown as the traditional graduation song 'Pomp and Circumstance' played. River Valley High School's principal, the school board president and the district's superintendent were also in attendance to award the school's first honorary degree of its kind; before giving one to Ms. Hunt, the school had only ever issued honorary degrees to veterans. 'It is my great honor, as a high school principal, to be presenting you with your honorary high school diploma,' principal Kimbert Kaukl told her during the ceremony. School of life: Ms. Hunt was presented with a diploma after her hospice nurse contacted the local high school . Ceremonial rituals: Supportive friends and family laughed and applauded as Ms. Hunt moved the tassel on her graduation cap from the right to the left sides, signifying that she had graduated . Ms. Hunt, who has lived in Spring Green her whole life, did not share whether she had designs on higher education, but she did say that she 'might have been college material,'\u00a0had she graduated when she was supposed to,as three of her siblings went on as three of her siblings went to college.

        "article": "Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany insists that UEFA\u2019s Financial Fair Play regulations protect elite clubs rather than helping teams avoid going bust. The Premier League champions were last year deemed to have breached FFP regulations, before being fined \u00a350million and ordered to operate with a \u00a349m transfer kitty this season. City are debt-free, mainly thanks to the vast wealth of owner Sheikh Mansour\u2019s heavy personal investment, whereas Manchester United were able to splash out \u00a3150m on new talent in the summer, despite being in the region of \u00a3400m in the red. Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany has slammed FFP for protecting the established order of clubs . Ahead of the Manchester derby on Sunday, Kompany has hit back at the FFP rulings, claiming they prevent other teams challenging the established sides at the upper echelons of the game. 'Just who is FFP protecting?' Kompany told the Sunday Mirror. 'For me, it is protecting those few clubs who were already geared up to be successful. \u2018Just because a club is part of the established order doesn't mean they should be guaranteed success forever,\u2019 he added. 'I just look at it in terms of the established order protecting themselves.\u2019 'When I first came to England seven years ago, it was the same four clubs always in the top four. That has changed. Our owners have invested to build a successful club. That in itself will bring in more fans and create more revenue. Is that so bad? Kompany and his City team-mates react after losing to Crystal Palace over the Easter weekend . Glenn Murray holds off a challenge from Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany at Selhurst park . The Belgian international has guided City to pick up two Premier League titles, a FA Cup and the Capital One Cup in the past four seasons, having joined the club just 10 days before Sheikh Mansour bought the club. Kompany praises the impact of the owners on aspects that aren\u2019t just beneficial to the club and claimed such a takeover and transformation would be impossible with FFP in full swing. \u2018Look at what this club has done for the community and the city of Manchester \u2013 and don't forget that we pay a lot of tax in the UK as well, so that helps the economy,\u2019 said Kompany. 'If City's owners hadn't invested like they did five years ago, it might have been too late for them to create a top club.' 'What has been introduced denies clubs like Leeds, Nottingham Forest and others with big fan-bases the opportunity to ever get to the top level again.'

        "article": "Picture the scene: You come home after work feeling too exhausted to cook - only to find a delicious meal worthy of a Michelin-starred restaurant waiting for you. It sounds like a fantasy, but it could be about to come true thanks to a robot chef developed by British scientists. They have come up with a set of robotic arms so sophisticated that they are capable of cooking meals from scratch. Scroll down for video . New hospitality: British scientists spent almost 18 years developing the robotic 'chef' hands . Scientists at the Shadow Robot Company spent almost 18 years developing the hands, which are each governed by 24 motors, 26 micro-controllers and 129 sensors. According to its creators, the arms can chop, stir, whisk and baste well enough to recreate almost anything you would care to eat, whether it is a simple home-cooked supper, or an elaborate concoction designed by a world-class chef. The hands move a little slowly, hovering strangely above the work surface whenever they are not busy, but they imitate human movements closely enough that they can do things such as wipe a spoon on the edge of a pan to prevent drips. The device will be sold from as early as 2017 as part of a purpose-built high-tech kitchen, priced at around \u00a310,000 ($14,000), which includes an oven, hob, dishwasher and sink. Engineers at the Shadow Robot Company spent almost 18 years developing the hands, which are each governed by 24 motors, 26 micro-controllers and 129 sensors. Working from a small workshop in Islington, North London, they used to sell a few dozen devices a year, primarily to other scientists who used them for their own research. Even Nasa is understood to have ordered a pair to \u2018inspire\u2019 its engineers. According to its creators, the arms can chop, stir, whisk and baste well enough to recreate almost anything you would care to eat, whether it is a simple home-cooked supper, or an elaborate concoction designed by a world-class chef. The hands move a little slowly, hovering strangely above the work surface whenever they are not busy, but they imitate human movements closely enough that they can do things such as wipe a spoon on the edge of a pan to prevent drips. But last year, after Russian engineer Mark Oleynik from Moley Robotics approached the team with the notion of turning the hands into an everyday household gadget, the concept of the robot chef was born. Kitchen revolution: A robot in the Robotic Kitchen prototype created by the Shadow Robot Company cooks a crab  soup at the company's booth at the world's largest industrial technology fair, the Hannover Messe . Working away: The robotic hands are each governed by 24 motors, 26 micro-controllers and 129 sensors . Even if there are a few splatters, it shouldn\u2019t matter - the gadget will load the dishwasher and wipe down the work surfaces afterwards. The arms will tuck up out of the way when not in use, making space for their owners to get their own hands dirty. Mr Oleynik, who is spearheading the project, said: \u2018All the things which are possible with the hand are possible here. There is no limitation. The \u00a310,000 ($14,000) device will be sold from as early as 2017 as part of a purpose-built high-tech kitchen which includes an oven, hob, dishwasher and sink . Bon app\u00e9tit: Chef Tim Anderson checks crab soup prepared by the 'robot chef' at  the Hannover Messe, in Hanover earlier today . \u2018A lot of people want to go to Michelin-starred restaurants, but they are quite expensive and may be quite far from the home. This is an opportunity for people to enjoy very good food, and for a reasonable price.\u2019 The only cuisine that is off the robot\u2019s menu at the moment is sushi, which requires exceedingly steady pressure and nimble fingers to make, but the team plan to conquer that as well by the time it goes on sale. By that point, they claim, users will be able to order meals from an iTunes-style library of recipes devised by professional chefs, making it possible to tuck into Michelin-standard food on a daily basis. People will also be able to train the robotic arms to cook their own favourite family recipes, by demonstrating them a few times while wearing high-tech gloves and wrist-bands. Users will be able to \u2018order\u2019 dinner on their way home, or breakfast for when they wake up, using an app on their smartphone, picking recipes depending on the ingredients they have in stock. They will also be able to choose dishes based on their nutritional content. And just in case, the unit has emergency equipment if there\u2019s a fire.",

A church treasurer accused of murdering his wife deliberately veered his 4x4 off the M1 causing it to explode as it hit trees, a court heard today. Leicester Crown Court was told that two dogs and suitcases were also thrown out of the pick-up truck being driven by Ian Walters as it crashed into a line of trees near Markfield, Leicestershire. Yesterday the court was told that his wife,\u00a0Tracy Walters, died after making a flurry of calls to police about sex-obsessed husband in the days leading up to the M1 crash, including one that morning. Prosecutors allege that Walters, a driving test examiner, deliberately steered his Mitsubishi L200 off the motorway after his wife said she wanted a divorce and made allegations of domestic abuse. Walters, 51, denies the murder of his wife, who died in hospital two days after the high-speed crash. A jury of nine women and three men was told yesterday that Walters, of  Swindon, was returning home with his wife from a 'make-or-break' week away in North Yorkshire which ended in an argument. Giving evidence to the second day of Walters' trial, several witnesses described how passing motorists went to aid the couple, both trapped in the wreckage of the 4x4. The first witness, Robin Goss, told jurors the driver of the pick-up appeared to have made a 'conscious, deliberate' decision to steer towards the hard shoulder. Mr Goss, a 39-year-old training consultant from Buckinghamshire, told jurors he was up to 150 metres behind the L200, doing around 70mph in the inside lane. 'Everything was normal,' Mr Goss told the court. 'Then all of a sudden I saw this car just swerve violently across to the left. 'It completely disappeared and I remember looking into the hard shoulder. Then I saw what looked like a little explosion. 'Bits of tree and bits of plastic came out in front of me. When I saw the dogs, I started to put together what had happened.' Child protection worker Gary Donald, who was driving a Kia Picanto on the southbound carriageway, also gave evidence to the court about the crash on March 21 last year. He told jurors he saw the pick-up veer sharply from right to left - performing 'almost a straight turn' - and move towards a line of trees. The couple, who were said to have had a 'troubled' relationship, had married in Cyprus in 2012 but their relationship is alleged to have become abusive soon afterwards, jurors heard . 'The canopy of all the trees shook - I would use the word 'imploded' - and there was luggage, bits of car, and parts of tree flying into the air,' Mr Donald said. Under questioning from defence QC Christopher Millington, Mr Donald agreed that time-lapse CCTV footage of the L200 showed a 'rather less dramatic' veer than he had described to the court. Witness Steven Prince, a passenger in a Range Rover which stopped at the scene, told how he attempted to reassure Mrs Walters before she was cut free. Giving his recollection on the aftermath of the crash, Mr Prince told the jury panel he did not witness the moment of impact but had seen a cloud of dust. 'I looked left and I saw two dogs out where they shouldn't be and I saw the car that was already in the tree.' After the crash, the metalwork of the vehicle had to be 'unpeeled' from around Mrs Walters by emergency crews, the court was told . The Mitsubishi L200 veered onto an embankment near junction 22 of the southbound carriageway in March last year. Pictured: Emergency services at the scene of the crash . Prosecutors allege that Walters, a driving test examiner, deliberately steered his Mitsubishi L200 off the motorway after his wife said she wanted a divorce and made allegations of domestic abuse . After getting out of his mother's car, Mr Prince said, he ran along the hard shoulder towards the crashed vehicle. 'The car was a hell of a mess,' Mr Prince added. 'I didn't bother looking at the driver's side because I thought whoever was in there was going to be squashed.' The court heard that the witness then made his way to the passenger side of the vehicle, where he saw a hand sticking out of the wreckage. He said: 'She said she was dying. I told her she would be alright and that I wasn't going anywhere, just to calm her down and make her feel at ease as much as I could.' Prosecutor Charles Miskin QC asked Mr Prince if Mrs Walters, who was aged 48, had said anything else. 'No, other than that she couldn't breathe,' Mr Prince replied. 'She kept on telling me that and she kept on saying that she was dying.' The trial, which may last for up to a month, was adjourned until next week.

        "article": "Kevin Pietersen has thrown his support behind former team-mate Michael Vaughan as the right man to 'change the brand of cricket currently being played' in England. Ten years on from his career-defining captaincy in the 2005 Ashes, Vaughan is the hot favourite to be appointed as director of England cricket, a streamlined version of the managing director's job which was abolished with Paul Downton's sacking on Wednesday. The 40-year-old has previously kept his distance from a formal role with the ECB, preferring to focus on his burgeoning media profile and business interests, but has declared himself open to discussions about the new post. Former England batsman Kevin Pietersen believes Michael Vaughan is the right man to lead England Cricket . Pietersen received the lion's share of attention during a photocall for his new club Surrey . The controversial star and Vaughan were England team-mates before Pietersen was axed by the ECB . Vaughan would be a pioneering presence, having spoken with passion and candour about the need to accept England's failings and press for change at all costs. That may yet prove good news for the exiled Pietersen. The controversial batsman has largely kept his counsel on the demise of Downton, whose first act in the job was to sack Pietersen last February. But he did tell BreatheSport that his 2005 Ashes captain Vaughan had the credentials to replace him. 'He (Vaughan) is close enough to the game to make changes which need to happen for the good of English cricket,' Pietersen said. 'The way he captained shows he'll change the brand of cricket currently being played, which we need.' Vaughan has previously concentrated on his media duties but is believed to be open to the role . The former England captain speaks with Stuart Broad during last summer's Test series with India . Vaughan holds the urn after England famously reclaimed the Ashes against Australia in 2005 . Pietersen may not have played international cricket for well over a year but his shadow looms large over the current turmoil surrounding England. Downton's troubled reign was defined by the decision to martyr Pietersen after the 2013/14 Ashes. The ECB board met at Lord's on Thursday, but there was no official word on the recruitment process. Instead a short statement merely confirmed that Giles Clarke's move from chairman to president had been rubber-stamped, with Middlesex deputy chairman Ian Lovett nominated as vice-chairman. Clarke will become the first ECB president on May 14, a role that carries responsibility for ICC business, while his old post will go to Colin Graves. Graves was the man who gave new legs to Pietersen's mooted comeback when he appeared to suggest a blank slate policy would take root when he arrived at Lord's. Graves hinted that a prolific run in county cricket could see him reinstated, which led to the 34-year-old extricating himself from his Indian Premier League contract and re-signing with Surrey. Downton's exit removed one significant obstacle and should Vaughan be handed the new position, that would strengthen his hand yet further. Former director of England Cricket, Paul Downton, was sacked after the nation's dismal World Cup . Another former England captain Alex Stewart has also put his hat into the ring for the vacancy . Surrey chief Alec Stewart, another former England captain who has indicated he would be open to talks with the ECB, is a confirmed Pietersen supporter - but another possible applicant, Andrew Strauss, is unlikely to be as effusive. Strauss' relations with Pietersen deteriorated badly in his final days as England captain, and an X-rated slip of the tongue during a commentary stint last summer suggested those wounds have not healed. There was no news from the board meeting on the future of national selector James Whitaker, who appeared vulnerable after Downton's dismissal. He looks set to continue in the role for the time being and is due to join the senior side in the West Indies for the second Test in Grenada and third in Barbados.",

The seal cull even takes place during the animals' breeding season - meaning that some cubs are being left to fend for themselves when their mothers are shot dead. Farmers say the seal killings are essential to stop the animals from destroying fish stocks off the coast of Scotland and northern England, but campaigners insist there are more humane methods of protecting fish. Warning: graphic images . Killed: This picture shows two seals shot in Crovie, north-east Scotland in an attempt to protect fish stocks . Shot: A seal killed near Blackpool; it is legal to cull seals without a licence in England . The practice of seal clubbing in Canada has long been regarded with revulsion around the world - but many Britons may be unaware that the animals are also being killed in the UK. Supporters of the practice claim that seals threaten farmed salmon, wild fish around the coasts and fish which are kept for sporting purposes. Figures from the Scottish government show that 205 seals were legally killed in Scottish waters last year by farmers, fishermen and angling firms. Some campaigners suggest that the real number of dead seals is much higher, as the official figure only includes those which were recorded to the authorities by people who had previously obtained licences. Fishermen have been given licences to kill more than 800 seals this year, although typically marksmen kill only around a quarter of the seals which can legally be culled. Trussed up: Two dead seals which have been thrown in the back of a van after being culled . Disposal: A van winches away the body of a seal after it was shot dead in Crovie to protect fish . Marksman: A gunman waits for the appearance of seals which could threaten stocks of salmon . Activists have called on consumers to more careful about buying Scottish salmon in supermarkets and fishmongers, encouraging them to investigate the origins of their fish. 'People who are horrified by what's happening in places like Norway and Scotland don't realise this is happening on their own doorstep,' said Andy Ottaway of the Seal Protection Action Group. 'The shooting tends to go on in remote locations, so it's not something most people tend to come across. Unlike in some countries, seals are not hunted in the UK for their skin, fur or meat. However, fishermen and farmer are allowed to kill seals which they believe are threatening fish stocks. In Scotland, they must get a licence which restricts the number of animals they can legally kill. But in the rest of Britain, there are no legal restrictions on culling seals, meaning people are free to do as they please. 'It's very simple - ask your retailer before you buy Scottish salmon whether seals were shot in the production of that salmon. 'Not every fish farmer is shooting seals, it's perfectly possible to protect fish without shooting seals.' He insisted that there is no need to cull seals in order to keep them away from fish stocks, saying that acoustic deterrents and strong nets can protect salmon just as well. Around three quarters of farms where seals are killed are certified by the RSPCA as 'Freedom Food' farms, Mr Ottaway added, saying that the animal protection charity should do more to crack down on the practice. He also called on the Scottish government to toughen up its licensing regime, which states that seals should only be killed as a 'last resort'. Mr Ottaway said: 'It's not the last resort if they're not using the best possible deterrents and the best possible nets. 'They recognise the value of seals as a tourist attraction, but have no problem with shooting them.' Threatened: British seal pups could starve if their mothers are shot dead (file photo) Protection: You need a licence to kill seals in Scotland but not in other parts of the UK (file photo) Because there are no restrictions on when farmers can kill seals if they have a licence, breeding mothers are likely to die, leaving their cubs unable to fend for themselves. Outside Scotland, it is legal to kill seals without any need for a licence - meaning that there is no way of measuring exactly how many die every year. The Scottish salmon industry, which produces annual export of \u00a3285million, insists that it is necessary to kill seals in order to protect farms. Scott Landsburgh of the Scottish Salmon Producers' Organisation told the Daily Mirror: 'We have championed deterrence techniques that are designed to keep seals away from our fish, and shooting is always last resort. 'When a determined seal attacks fish in our pens it can kill and damage large numbers and it is important that we do whatever we can to reduce the chances of this happening.' A spokesman for the Scottish government said: 'Scottish seals are now better protected than ever before. Since 2011 it has been illegal in Scotland to shoot a seal except as a last resort under strict licensing conditions, and the number of seals shot under licence has more than halved since then.'",

        "article": "(CNN)Governments around the world are using the threat of terrorism -- real or perceived -- to advance executions, Amnesty International alleges in its annual report on the death penalty. \"The dark trend of governments using the death penalty in a futile attempt to tackle real or imaginary threats to state security and public safety was stark last year,\" said Salil Shetty, Amnesty's Secretary General in a release. \"It is shameful that so many states around the world are essentially playing with people's lives -- putting people to death for 'terrorism' or to quell internal instability on the ill-conceived premise of deterrence.\" The report, \"Death Sentences and Executions 2014,\" cites the example of Pakistan lifting a six-year moratorium on the execution of civilians following the horrific attack on a school in Peshawar in December. China is also mentioned, as having used the death penalty as a tool in its \"Strike Hard\" campaign against terrorism in the restive far-western province of Xinjiang. The annual report catalogs the use of state-sanctioned killing as a punitive measure across the globe, and this year's edition contains some mixed findings. On one hand, the number of executions worldwide has gone down by almost 22% on the previous year. At least 607 people were executed around the world in 2014, compared to 778 in 2013. Amnesty's figures do not include statistics on executions carried out in China, where information on the practice is regarded as a state secret. Belarus and Vietnam, too, do not release data on death penalty cases. \"The long-term trend is definitely positive -- we are seeing a decrease in the number of executions (worldwide),\" Audrey Gaughran, Amnesty's Director of Global Issues, told CNN. \"A number of countries are closer to abolition, and there are some signs that some countries will be abolitionist by 2015. (There are) signals of a world that is nearing abolition.\" While the report notes some encouraging signs, it also highlights a marked increase in the number of people sentenced to death in 2014. At least 2,466 people globally are confirmed to have been handed the sentence last year, an increase of 28% compared with 2013. The report notes that the spike in sentencing is attributable to mass-sentencing in countries including Egypt and Nigeria, \"against scores of people in some cases.\" The organization found \"positive developments\" worldwide, with most regions seeming to show reductions in the number of executions. Opinion: Sharp spike in death sentences . Sub-Saharan Africa, for example, saw a 28% fall in reported cases, and executions recorded in the Middle East and North Africa were down 23% compared to 2013. \"Even though we've highlighted some of the negative developments... I think we would always highlight that there are positive developments,\" Gaughran said. \"Across the board, with the exception of Europe and Central Asia there were fewer reports of executions in every region.\" The resumption of the use of capital punishment in Belarus -- the only country in Europe and Central Asia to execute people -- after a two year hiatus spoiled an near-universal decrease in countries using the death penalty by region. The United States has the dubious distinction of being the only country in the Americas to conduct executions, but the number of convicts put to death here fell slightly, from 39 in 2013 to 35 in 2014. The state of Washington also imposed a moratorium on executions last year. The U.S. remains one of the worst offenders for imposing capital punishment, with only Iran (289+), Iraq (61+), and Saudi Arabia (90+) executing more people in 2014. While figures are not available, Amnesty estimates that China also executes \"thousands\" of prisoners each year, \"more than the rest of the world put together.\" The report also highlights the imperfections in the judiciary processes that lead to many sentenced to death. \"In the majority of countries where people were sentenced to death or executed, the death penalty was imposed after proceedings that did not meet international fair trial standards,\" the report stated. \"In 2014 Amnesty International raised particular concerns in relation to court proceedings in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, China, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Sri Lanka.\" The United Nations Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, last year stressed the need to move toward abolition of capital punishment. \"The taking of life is too irreversible for one human being to inflict it on another,\" he said, in marking World Day against Death Penalty in October. \"We must continue to argue strongly that the death penalty is unjust and incompatible with fundamental human rights.\" Amnesty estimates that at least 19,094 people were believed to be on death row at the end of 2014.",

        "article": "The pizza delivery driver who is accused of stabbing and strangling his roommate then having sex with her corpse seemed to revel her talking about the pain he inflicted on her, prosecutors revealed today at the first day of his trial. Bryan Santana of Orlando, Florida, who is accused of killing\u00a0Shelby\u00a0Fazio and her dog last October, was described by prosecutors as 'delighting' in the pain he allegedly caused the young woman. 'He delights in every moment of telling explicitly what he had done to Shelby,' Assistant State Attorney Mark Interlicchio told jurors during opening statements. Jurors also heard the after allegedly wrapping a belt around Fazio's neck and stabbing her in the throat with a pen, Santana then reportedly had sex with her corpse, killed and mutilated her dog and wrote messages in blood on the wall. One of those messages read: 'I'm not sorry for what I did.' Scroll down for video . Bryan Santana (left) of Orlando, Florida has been charged with murder in the death of his former roommate Shelby Fazio (right) He is also charged with attempted murder for allegedly attacking their third roommate with a knife and killing Fazio's dog (above), and using its blood to write messages on the wall . The Orlando Sentinel\u00a0reports that jurors also heard that Santana even messaged a friend and forewarned what was to come, claiming he was going to 'gut' someone, and then saying; 'I have zero money to pay my $400 rent so I'm going to do what I want. I will fulfill my deepest desires.' Orange County Sheriff's Deputy Charlie Murphy also took the stand on Wednesday, describing the grizzly scene he discovered when he arrived at the residence Fazio and Santana shared. 'I noticed a body laying on the ground, the door hit the left leg of the body,' he said. 'She was naked. I remember she had a belt around her throat and some type of pen or pencil shoved into her neck.' This came just days after Santana's lawyer argued that he is not competent to stand trial following an incident where he smeared feces all over himself and tried to hit a corrections officer at the courthouse during opening statements in the case. 'He has now soiled himself and smeared himself in feces and smeared the wall,' said Judge Renee Roache after the incident, according to\u00a0WKMG. 'I've ordered security to clean him up and bring him up here in full restraints.' And while she allowed two doctors to examine the young man, she has made it clear that she has no time for this\u00a0behavior. 'He certainly knows how to behave himself in the courtroom. He behaved himself very well yesterday. Now that the train is coming down the tracks at full speed, we are seeing some other behavior,' she said. 'I will not tolerate disruption in this courtroom. If I have to gag him, I will. If I have to remove him I will.' In earlier court documents, Santana confessed to the\u00a0strangling, stabbing and sexual intercourse. He is now claiming he has multiple personalities, including one named 'Michael.' In court documents, Santana (right) admitted to strangling and stabbing Fazio (left), a Disney World employee, to death, and then having sex with her corpse . Fazio, 23, had moved in with the young man to begin a job at Disney World. The two had a third roommate who Santana also allegedly tried to kill, and for which he faces an\u00a0attempted\u00a0murder charge. That roommate claims Santana pepper sprayed him and came at him with a knife. 'He came at me, pepper sprayed me, I tried to knock the knife out of his hand and was successful in doing that,' said John Heermance. 'And then we wrestled in the living room area.' Heermance then testified on Wednesday that at this point Santana told him to go into his room and everything would be fine. After the incident, Santana is believed to have taken Fazio's car and tried to go to a Walmart to buy a toy gun in hopes that he would be shot dead if he pointed it at police, a jury heard. He also went and got a haircut. Friends say the young man no longer wanted to live. Laura Ramirez, a friend of Santana, said on the stand: 'He just said he was going to fulfill his fantasies.' She then added: 'He said he was going to gut her.'",

        "article": "Whatever caused small space rocks to lump together billions of years ago, magnetism is unlikely to be the reason. Scientists announced today that measurements made by the European space probe Philae, which landed on comet 67P in November, show the comet's core isn't magnetised. Some astrophysicists have suggested that magnetism might have been responsible for aligning and then binding together rocks into larger boulders during the early stages of planet formation. A composite of 18 images showing off the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko activity from different angles as seen between 31 January (top left) and 25 March (bottom right), when the spacecraft was at distances of about 30 to 100 km from the comet . But in a paper published online by the journal Science, the team led by Hans-Ulrich Auster at the Technical University of Braunschweig, Germany, said their data \u2014 which benefited from three unexpected bounces that allowed Philae to collect more results than planned \u2014 don't support this theory. 'If the surface was magnetised, we would have expected to see a clear increase in the magnetic field readings as we got closer and closer to the surface,' said Auster. 'If comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is representative of all cometary nuclei, then we suggest that magnetic forces are unlikely to have played a role in the accumulation of planetary building blocks greater than one meter (3 feet) in size.' Allan H. Treiman, a senior scientist at the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston, Texas, who wasn't involved in the study, said the results credibly suggest other forces were responsible. Magnetic  data before (top) and after (bottom) the cliff collision at between the first and second touchdowns. Height above the surface is plotted on the x-axis and magnetic field strength on the y-axis. The measurements (crosses) are compared with a hypothetical model (solid line) assuming a slightly magnetised surface . data collected by the Rosetta Plasma Consortium fluxgate magnetometer on board the orbiter (top) and the Rosetta Lander Magnetometer and Plasma Monitor on board the lander (bottom) have been used to investigate the magnetic properties of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko . Studying the properties of a comet can provide clues to the role that magnetic fields played in the formation of Solar System bodies almost 4.6 billion years ago. The infant Solar System was once nothing more than a swirling disc of gas and dust but, within a few million years, the Sun burst into life in the centre of this turbulent disc, with the leftover material going into forming the asteroids, comets, moons and planets. The dust contained an appreciable fraction of iron, some of it in the form of magnetite. Indeed, millimetre-sized grains of magnetic materials have been found in meteorites, indicating their presence in the early Solar System. This leads scientists to believe that magnetic fields threading through the proto-planetary disc could have played an important role in moving material around as it started to clump together to form larger bodies. 'Auster did not find any magnetic field, with a very sensitive instrument, so it seems unlikely that magnetism in the solar nebula was significant for the collection of meter-sized objects,' Treiman said in an email. 'At that scale, it seems likely that electrostatic or gravitational attraction would be stronger.' The findings are part of a series of scientific results obtained by scientists analyzing data collected by the Philae lander and its mothership Rosetta, which is flying alongside the comet on its elliptical orbit around the sun. Magnetic data providing an estimate of the final landing region. Initially, Philae was seen to rotate slowly during the descent to Agilkia. It landed and then bounced, rotating significantly faster as the momentum of the internal flywheel was transferred to the lander . Some astrophysicists have suggested that magnetism might have been responsible for aligning and then binding together rocks into larger boulders during the early stages of planet formation.

He is the Pensions Minister who famously said we should be free to blow our life savings on a Lamborghini. But after liberating a nation to spend their money as they wish, Steve Webb has now urged people to take their time rather than make rash decisions. Yesterday the biggest pension reforms in a century were launched, allowing over-55s to cash in their pension pots rather than being forced to buy a fixed monthly income. But as Pensions Freedom Day finally arrived, the Government appealed for caution, perhaps fearing that some people will quickly exhaust their funds and be forced to rely on the State. Mr Webb said over-55s \u2018don\u2019t have to rush this\u2019 and insisted there was \u2018a case for waiting and seeing\u2019. He said April 6 was the \u2018starting gun\u2019 and not a \u2018deadline\u2019, adding: \u2018We want people to make informed choices. This isn\u2019t a mad scramble rush to do something this morning.\u2019 Asked about his flippant remark last year that people should be able to buy a Lamborghini with their pension, he admitted \u2018you will pay a hell of a lot of tax\u2019 if you do. While the first 25 per cent of any withdrawals from pensions are tax-free, savers will have to pay income tax on the remainder. Those who withdraw their pension in one go face hefty bills if they are pushed into a higher tax bracket. Official forecasts show that the Treasury is set to receive an additional \u00a3370million of income tax in the next year as a result of the changes. Scroll down for video . Mr Cameron has a bit of lunch with Lilli Docherty and her daughter Dakota as they eat lunch in the garden with people who have benefited from tax and pension changes that came into force today . And documents published alongside the Budget suggest this could reach \u00a33.8billion by 2020. Research by consumer group Which? shows that buying a \u00a3228,000 Lamborghini Aventador would incur a \u00a3126,000 tax bill if you withdrew the cash in one go \u2013 enough to buy a Porsche 911 Turbo. But a study by insurer Aegon found that a third of over-55s were unaware of the tax implications of withdrawing all their money at once. Spokesman Kate Smith said: \u2018People could lose out on thousands of pounds of their hard-earned savings.\u2019 Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg - who was out campaigning with the Energy  Secretary Ed Davey in Surbiton, London, today - has hailed the pensions reforms . And yesterday Dr Ros Altmann, the Government\u2019s champion for older workers, warned that people who withdraw their cash could be hit with a \u2018triple tax whammy\u2019 \u2013 on their withdrawal, on any new investment and because the money no longer had tax-free status. She urged caution, and said that right now she would advise pensioners to \u2018do nothing\u2019. The new reforms will allow 2.1million over-55s to withdraw all or part of their funds rather than being required to buy an annuity. Studies show many will use at least part of their money to go on holiday, pay off debts, renovate their homes or help their family financially. However it could take time for people to get their hands on their pension pot. While all firms must allow people to take their entire lump sum, many will not allow partial withdrawals. This means many customers will have to switch companies, incurring exit fees and involving time-consuming paperwork. Michelle Cracknell, of the Pensions Advisory Service, said she would advise pensioners \u2018not to book the cruise right now\u2019.

The 2013 finalist looked set to ease through to the last 16 after resuming on Monday with a 7-2 overnight lead which he extended to 9-4 to move within one frame of victory. But Selt responded by reeling off five frames in a row - including back-to-back centuries - before a cool clearance from Hawkins saw him into the second round with a 10-9 win. Barry Hawkins celebrates after qualifying for the second round of the World Snooker Championship . Hawkins kept his composure to win 10-9 after Matthew Selt's impressive comeback at the Crucible . Selt won five frames in a row to launch a comeback, however he was unable to progress to the second round . Hawkins said: 'I can't keep putting myself through that. There's nothing worse than when someone is coming back at you like that and you can see your lead disappearing. 'You're telling yourself it's only one frame but you can see him growing in confidence and potting long balls so it is a horrible place to be.' Hawkins, who will play either Mark Allen or Ryan Day in the second round, is no stranger to Crucible drama having fended off a famous comeback from Dominic Dale in last year's quarter-finals. And the 35-year-old from Kent believes his close call against Selt will help give him the impetus he needs after a largely frustrating season by his own standards. Hawkins added: 'It's not been the best season but it's partly my own fault because I had a bad attitude in the middle of the season and I wasn't enjoying it. 'I've played a lot of snooker over the last couple of years and I think I just got fed up with it and my attitude stunk, I suppose. 'But there's nothing like getting kicked up the backside a few times and getting beaten to get the motivation back.' Former champion Neil Robertson wasted no time wrapping up victory over Jamie Jones to move into the last 16. Resuming like Hawkins with a 7-2 overnight advantage, Robertson did things the easy way with an opening break of 133 setting him up to reel off the three frames required for a 10-2 win.

In a photo album that spans over China, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, extraordinary images portray the crop's full cycle from the primitive sowing of seeds to the distribution of millions of tonnes for consumption. The pictures were taken by professional photographer Scott Gable, 39, who spent four months travelling across the region documenting the labour and threadbare equipment used to harvest the carbohydrate-rich food. Scroll down for video . Majestic: A farmer wades through the mud with a stick as late morning rain falls on top of Dragonsbone terraces in Longsheng County, China . Rice is a staple food for more than one-half the world's population, but for many consumers, its origin remains somewhat of a mystery. The crop accounts for one fifth of all calories consumed by humans and 87 per cent of it is produced in Asia. It is also the thirstiest crop there is - according to the UN, farmers need at least 2,000 litres of water to make one kilogram of rice. Mr Gable said he\u00a0was determined to capture every stage of production with his Rice Project - from the planting to the harvesting all the way down to the shipping of the food. After acquiring some contacts from experts at Cornell University in New York and conducting his own research, he left for China last May and spent the next four months traveling. He said: 'The images were taken over a four month period from April to July last year across Asia. I visited China, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia as part of my Rice Project.

'The project is one part of a larger three part project on global food staples - rice, corn and wheat. I am currently in the process of shooting the corn segment. 'The industrialisation of our food and mono-culture food staples have interested me for some time so that's probably what inspired me to do this project. 'I shot the whole project using a Canon SLR and GoPros. The actual shooting took four months and then post production took another four more months. 'The reaction to my work has been incredibly positive - I was able to secure a solo gallery show and create quite a bit of interest online which has been great.' Family crop: A Hani woman in traditional clothing sits on top of her family's rice store in Yunnan Province, China . Arduous labour: Employees of Taiwan's state-run rice experimental station are pictured beating rice husks by hand as the sun shines on them . Mr Gable spent months learning Mandarin Chinese in preparation for his trip, but the language barrier was still his greatest challenge. In an interview on photographic blog  Slate, he added: 'I had enough Chinese that I could get around in the big cities, but once I got into the highlands or mountains they don't speak Mandarin. 'There are so many different languages in China. That was very difficult. There's no iPhone translation for these dialects.' Mr Gable is already working on a new related project documenting corn production and after that, he plans to do a similar investigation of wheat. The three projects together form part of his mission to inspire people to think about food and its origins in an enlightened way.

According to Facebook, the family is part of a band called 'Matthew 24 Now' (they are also go by 'Busking in the Son' back in Idaho). The name refers to a Biblical passage dealing with the end of times. The remaining members of the Gaver family have been jailed, including an 11-year-old and 15-year-old who were sent to a juvenile detention facility. On duty: Cottonwood Police Sgt Jeremy Daniels, 31 (pictured), was shot in the leg during the attack but is expected to make a full recovery. One of the suspects, David Gaver, was shot in the abdomen but has since been released from hospital . The Arizona Department of Public Safety, who are investigating the shooting, said it was sparked when a few members of the Gaver family went into the Walmart to use the bathroom, and one of the store employees followed them into the restroom. At least one member of the Gaver family shoved the female employee, which led to the store calling 911. When police arrived on the scene to investigate the incident, they found the Gavers in the parking lot where they had been living out of a large SUV for the past few days.

        "article": "Claim: Murder suspect Dmitri Kovtun says that Alexander Litvinenko killed himself by mistake . One of the men accused of killing Alexander Litvinenko claimed today that the Russian spy's death may have been an 'accidental suicide' after he inadvertently handled polonium. Dmitri Kovtun, who is wanted for the dissident's murder, insisted that he was not involved in Mr Litvinenko's death and suggested that he had poisoned himself without knowing it. The suspect, a former KGB agent, has agreed to give evidence at the inquiry into Litvinenko's death as long as he is given the right to examine secret evidence put forward by the police. If Kovtun testifies, he will have to do so by video link, because he will be arrested on suspicion of murder if he tries to travel to Britain. Mr Litvinenko met with Kovtun and Alexander Lugovoi, another former spy, in London shortly before he fell ill with radiation poisoning in November 2006 and died at the age of 43. At a press conference in Russia today, Kovtun asserted his innocence and blamed Mr Litvinenko for his own death - saying he was carrying around polonium rather than being given it by Kovtun and Lugovoi, as has been previously claimed. He described the death as an 'accidental suicide', adding: 'I am more than sure that he was dealing with polonium without knowing it. 'Maybe there was some kind of polonium leak and it was gradually accumulating in his body. 'I don't know if he had it with him or if somebody gave him something that he carried with him. Where he got the polonium from, that is the question.' Scroll down for video . Killed: Litvinenko died of radiation poisoning in November 2006 after meeting Kovtun and Alexander Lugovoi . Denial: Kovtun told a press conference today that he had no involvement in Litvinenko's death . The inquiry has previously heard that Mr Litvinenko ingested polonium-210 when he drank a cup of tea during a meeting with the two ex-KGB men at the Millennium Hotel in central London. But Kovtun said this was impossible, adding: 'Litvinenko told me that he would not eat anything because the night before he got terrible poisoning, was throwing up all night, and called an ambulance. 'That proves our total innocence, that he had already come into contact with polonium, perhaps several days before our meeting.' He insisted that the reason he and Lugovoi left a trail of polonium around London during their visit to the city was because they had been contaminated by their meeting with Mr Litvinenko. Polonium is exceptionally rare, and experts have previously said that the amount ingested by the victim could only have been produced in a government-run facility. Suspects: Kovtun, left, and Lugovoi, right, have previously refused to co-operate with the public inquiry into Litvinenko's death . Meeting: Litvinenko fell ill after going to see Kovtun and Lugovoi at the Millennium Hotel in London, pictured . The two suspects had refused to co-operate with the public inquiry currently under way into Mr Litvinenko's death, saying that it would be biased against them. But last month, Kovtun dramatically changed his mind, and said that he would give evidence only if he is given 'core participant' status. At today's press conference, he told reporters: 'If I don't get this status, I will not participate.' Chairman Sir Robert Owen has issued Kovtun with a list of conditions which he must fulfil in order to be given the status, including issuing a full witness statement and disclosing all relevant documents. However, even if he is allowed to become a core participant he will not be given access to restricted material. Family: Litvinenko's son Anatoly and wife Marina outside the inquiry at the Royal Courts of Justice . The inquiry has set aside three days in late July for Kovtun to give evidence over video link. Mr Litvinenko accused Russian president Vladimir Putin of being responsible for his killing in a statement issued from his deathbed. The spy fled Russia and sought refuge in Britain in 2000, after he spoke against Putin, who he claimed had ordered him to kill tycoon Boris Berezovsky. The inquiry was shown video footage of Russian special forces using a photograph of Mr Litvinenko as target practice, as well as a picture of him looking gaunt and weak hours before he died.",

        "article": "A catalogue of failings have been uncovered at two NHS hospitals after seven babies and three mothers died there in the space of just eight months. Independent investigators were called into Royal Oldham after the deaths of four babies and two mothers, and North Manchester General after the deaths of another three babies and one mother. Lisa Parkisson, 35, died at Oldham Royal 48 hours after giving birth in April this year, while newborn Thomas Beaty died at the same hospital in June after doctors pushed him back into the womb during birth. Lisa Parkisson, 35, (left with son Zac) died 48 hours after giving birth at Oldham Royal in June last year. Thomas Beaty (right) died from  at the same hospital after doctors forced him back into the womb . A summary of the investigation, which was kept secret from the families of the dead until now, has been seen by MailOnline and found 'notable absence of clinical leadership' in the maternity wards, and\u00a0a 'failure to adequately plan care' in a number of cases. A team of independent investigators also found risk management was 'below standard' in some cases - though there were no apparent 'deficiencies in care' in the deaths of the three mothers. The report noted that several of the mothers were obese or morbidly obese, which can lead to complications, but that national guidelines for treating overweight people were not followed. Officials also criticised the hospital's own investigations, saying the root cause of the deaths was not always identified, opportunities to learn lessons were not always picked up, and that some recommendations were too general and difficult to measure. All of the deaths are believed to have occurred between December 2013, and July last year. In one case mother Lisa Parkisson, 35, also died 48 hours after giving birth to her son Zac in June this year. In another case newborn Thomas Beaty died from head injuries in April after medics forced him back into the womb during birth. Doctors had also tried and failed to remove him from the womb five times using forceps, despite national guidelines only recommending three attempts. While his death was not included in the review, staff at North Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust, which controls the two hospitals, have asked investigators to look into it. Martin Beaty, the father of Thomas, said: 'Ten deaths in eight months is sickening. But I'm not surprised. Independent investigators found failings in care and hospital leadership at Oldham Royal following the deaths of four babies and two mothers there in eight months . The report, which also looked into the deaths of three babies and another mother at North Manchester General, found that national guidelines for treating obese mothers were also not followed . 'The standard of care we received during and after Thomas died gives me zero confidence in their organisation, structure and accountability. 'I'm angry we were not informed [about the report], even if out of courtesy. It feels like they're trying to cover each other's backs. 'But I'm fully behind any action that makes sure this sort of thing is prevented in the future.' Pennine Acute is in the process of producing an action plan based on the recommendations from the findings. They include strengthening clinical leadership and risk management, making sure enough staff are on duty to ensure safety and reviewing the process for employing temporary locum doctors. Royal Oldham Hospital's new maternity unit, children's unit and neonatal intensive care unit opened in December 2012. The \u00a344m facility became one of three specialist Greater Manchester neonatal centres as part of a controversial \u00a3120m shake-up which saw maternity units shut in Bury, Rochdale and Salford. Gill Harris, Chief Nurse at Pennine Acute, said: 'The Trust is always keen to learn and to improve care. We commissioned a review by experts from outside the Trust to look at the details of a small number of maternity cases at our hospitals. 'We are now considering that report and are developing a number of actions as a result to make some improvements to ensure we continue to provide the best quality of care for our patients. 'We deliver 10,000 babies each year and would like to reassure families about the safety of maternity services at our hospitals, but if any expectant mother has a concern they can contact their designated midwife to discuss this.' A spokeswoman for the Care Quality Commission, the health regulator, said: 'CQC is aware that Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust has recently initiated an external review into its maternity services and we are in close liaison with the trust, NHS England and local CCG regarding the review findings.'",

They host Rangers on Tuesday with Sherwood admitting he does not have the players to grind out results. Victory would move Villa five points clear of the Barclays Premier League drop zone but they will return to the bottom three if QPR, three points behind with a better goal difference, win. And Sherwood underlined the magnitude of the game ahead of the showdown. Tim Sherwood (from left to right), Les Ferdinand and Chris Ramsey during their time at White Hart Lane .

'This is without doubt the biggest game of the season for Villa and possibly one of the biggest in a number of years. 'This is the biggest (of my managerial career).' But the boss believes he must instil a different mentality into his players as he tries to keep them in the top flight. 'We've got different types of players, you look through QPR's side and they've got a lot of players who are men - with a lot of experience in there,' he said. 'We've got a few men in there - but we've got a lot of pretty much icing-on-the-cake players and I'm trying to get that mentality into them to forget about digging out results. It's not what we're cut out to do. 'I haven't identified many players who can't cope with the pressure, but you don't know until they get out there.' Sherwood is without Alan Hutton, Ashley Westwood and Scott Sinclair while Tom Cleverley, Kieran Richardson and Aly Cissokho are doubts. Sherwood faces his friend and former Tottenham assistant, QPR boss Chris Ramsey, for the first time since they both left Spurs last summer. Sherwood and Ramsey forged their friendship at Tottenham and remain close ahead of their showdown . The bond between the two remains strong even if Sherwood is blocking Ramsey's mobile phone calls for now . Sherwood hinted that if Ramsey's tenure at Loftus Road ends, then he would ask to bring him to Villa Park . Ramsey has admitted his job at Rangers could be under threat if they get relegated and, while he admitted Ramsey may prefer to be a manager, Sherwood left the door open for a reunion at Villa. He added: 'If there was ever an opportunity for me to work with him again I would do that. 'I would have to speak to the club about whether we could find a role for him here. 'Listen, I know I am biased - he has been good for me and I have been good for him. But he is up there with the very best coaches I have ever seen.'

Many firemen have not been trained in basic first aid \u2013 yet they are being left to care for seriously ill elderly patients for hours while they wait for an ambulance. The Fire Brigades Union say the practice is irresponsible and dangerous but is becoming increasingly common because the ambulance service is so overstretched. The ambulance service is becoming increasingly reliant on firemen to attend life-threatening emergencies . The Fire Brigade Union say the practice is irresponsible and dangerous and becoming more common . Senior union officials say fire engines are routinely being turned into makeshift ambulances to ferry patients to A&E. They normally carry a few blankets, oxygen masks to protect against smokes and a defibrillator \u2013 to restart the heart. In one case earlier this year an elderly lady is feared to have died because she was left in the hands of fire crews for nearly 40 minutes while paramedics were delayed. The ambulance service is facing unprecedented demand from the rising and aging population and in some areas 999 calls are up by 15 per cent on last year. Paramedics are also having to respond to rising numbers of non-urgent calls from patients frustrated that they cannot get an appointment with their GP. They are also having to waste much of their time queued up outside A&E units which cannot accept their patients because staff there are also very busy. This has all led to the ambulance service increasingly relying on firemen to attend potentially life-threatening emergencies. The Fire Brigades Union yesterday warned that South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue were sending firemen with no medical training to 999 calls instead of ambulances. It pointed out that only a third of firefighters at this branch had any medical training \u2013 and even this only consisted of a four day course of basic first aid. Yet in one case they were left to help an elderly lady who had stopped breathing for 45 minutes whilst they waited for the ambulance to arrive. Senior union officials say fire engines are routinely being turned into makeshift ambulances to ferry patients to A&E . In another, they tended to a pensioner who had fallen and banged her head for two hours before they were forced to leave her on her own \u2013 to attend a fire. The practice is occurring across the country and last July, firemen took a 16-year-old girl with suspected bleeding on the brain to A&E in Warrington, Cheshire . In December, crews were sent to a care home in Ryde on the Isle of Wight where an elderly woman had a stroke and were ordered to cut the rings off her fingers which were turning blue because of poor blood flow. Ian Murray, vice-president of the Fire Brigades Union \u2013 which represents 44,000 firemen \u2013 said: 'We know only a small percentage of firefighters are trained to give basic first aid. 'It is irresponsible and dangerous to put untrained firefighters in the position of attending incidents to assist the ambulance service, with the knowledge that it is highly unlikely one will arrive for some considerable time.' In January, a woman of 84 from Doncaster is feared to have died because firemen were sent to her home rather than an ambulance. Paramedics did not show up for 40 minutes after which time her pulse had stopped. Last month the Mail revealed how London Ambulance Service had resorted to flying half way round the world to Australia to hire 225 paramedics because it is so overstretched.",

In a report issued to the Herald Sun, Victoria police revealed that there is a distribution network of speed, ice and marijuana operating in the trucking industry and one in every 12 truckies tested positive for drugs while out on the road. Speaking to the publication, a former Melbourne truck driver said his colleagues were taking drugs regularly, and  meeting areas were often set up between drivers over radios using codes, where drugs were then handed out. Scroll down for video . A new report has shown that truck drivers in Victoria are dealing drugs from the behind the wheel of 60-tonne rigs, using secretive codes over their radio systems . 'Yes, some people take speed and ice but there is \u00adalways going to be rampant drug use if truckers are \u00adrequired to work these long hours,' the truck driver said. 'Do you think these people are dancing and raving in their trucks? No, it's not for fun they are using, it as a tool to do their jobs.' 156 truck drivers tested positive for drugs on Victoria's roads in the past year alone and it was revealed that they are using their log books to roll out lines and smoke ice. Detective Inspector Bernie Rankin, head of Victoria Police's transport investigations unit, said these flippant drivers were treating other motorists like roadkill and are risking\u00a0everyone's\u00a0lives. 156 truck drivers tested positive for drugs on Victoria's roads in the past year alone and it was revealed that they are using their log books to roll out lines and smoke ice . 'There are various ways these distribution networks are working. Often it's from a geographical location, they might know a driver who is involved in the industry, a pick-up point or there might be a loading area where there will be someone with illicit substances,' Inspector Rankin said. The news comes after a worrying video has appeared online in February exposing a truck driver snorting drugs from behind the wheel of a heavy vehicle before taking to the road. The shocking footage shows that many drivers are rorting the system so they can drive for up to 16 hours a day. One truck driver filmed himself\u00a0lighting\u00a0up a pipe filled with Ice (methamphetamine) and taking to the Hume Highway in an\u00a0A Current Affair report. A worrying video appeared online in February exposing a truck driver (above) snorting drugs from behind the wheel of a heavy vehicle before taking to the road . The driver was embarking on a 12 hour shift on the Hume Highway, which is an 807km road between Melbourne and Sydney . 'And yep\u2026 Fatigue about to be managed. Get it into ya,' the driver says in the clip, where he documented how and when he took the substances, telling viewers that he snorted the drug off his log book and also used a pipe. The horrifying part is that the trucker is behind a 40-tonne truck and is just about to embark on his 12 hour shift on the Hume Highway, which is an 807km road between Melbourne and Sydney. When cornered by Martin King from A Current Affair, the driver denied his involvement in the video and refused to comment. However, Simon Green, a former employee of the same company where the 'lunatic truckie' works said drugs are rampant in the trucking industry. Mr Green, who used to take part in recreational drug taking while he was a truck driver, now admits that it was dangerous and stupid but claims it is easy to get around the police and it is cheaper than you would think. The shocking footage comes after it has emerged that one in 12 truckies are high on illicit substances when they are pulled over by Victorian police and many are rorting the system so they can drive for up to 16 hours a day . One truck driver (pictured) has filmed himself lighting up a pipe filled with Ice (methamphetamine) and taking to the highway in a new A Current Affair report . When NSW police busted Mr Green for driving while under the influence of drugs, he lost his licence for a year and is now clean. He said the general public would be stunned if they knew the extent to which illicit substances are used by truckies out on the road in their rigs. 'I'd say at least 10 per cent of the drivers out there are doing it right now,' Mr Green said. However, speaking to the program, Inspector Bernie Rankin said he had underestimated the figure, claiming one in 12 heavy vehicle drivers test positive for drugs when they are pulled over. The horrifying part is that the trucker is behind a 40-tonne truck and is just about to embark on his 12 hour shift on the road . one in 12 heavy vehicle drivers test positive for drugs like Ice (pictured) when they are pulled over. Mr Green said he knew his limits when it came to taking the drug, but Inspector Rankin claims that is 'absolute nonsense'. 'A multitude of medical studies done throughout the world all reach the conclusion that ingesting these type of substances impacts critically on your ability to drive, observe what's going on around you and the ability to even control the vehicle you're in,' he said. According to the law, heavy vehicle drivers are supposed to only drive for a maximum of 12 hours a day. The diver acted innocent and denied his involvement in the video when he was confronted by A Current Affair . The shocking video shows a man inhaling a drug through a pipe while telling viewers that he is heading north on the Hume Highway . However, drivers have now worked out that they can manipulate their log books through a loophole and they can actually work a 16.25 hour day in 24 hours. Speaking to the Herald Sun, Inspector Rankin said they are concerned that illicit drug taking is contributing to the amount of truck crashes on the road each year . 'This manipulation of their work diary gives regulated heavy vehicle drivers the opportunity to drive in excess of their prescribed hours four times in a seven-day period and be non-prosecutable,' he said. Inspector Bernie Rankin from The Victoria Police Transport and Investigation section (pictured right) claimed one in 12 heavy vehicle drivers test positive for drugs when they are pulled over .",

They have until May 1 to appeal the decision and, should they choose to, that could have ramifications with an ultimate decision likely to be taken after the season has finished. Rotherham manager Steve Evans has seen his side deducted three points by the Football League . On-loan Derby defender Farrend Rawson (third right) played in the 1-0 win over Brighton on Easter Monday . Rawson (right, pictured playing for Derby's Under 21 side) wore the Rotherham shirt four times . Rotherham were on 44 points (left) but are now just one point above the relegation zone after the deduction . A Football League statement read: 'Rotherham were also fined the sum of \u00a330,000, half of which will be suspended until the end of the 2015-16 season. The club must also pay the costs of the hearing and the Football League.' The Football League set a precedent for penalties this time last year after slapping AFC Wimbledon with a three-point deduction and \u00a35,000 fine after playing Jake Nicholson when he wasn\u2019t registered correctly. Blackpool were fined \u00a330,000 earlier this season after starting on-loan Donervon Daniels once his 28-day youth loan had expired but escaped the loss of points because they lost at Millwall on August 30. Top QC Jim Sturman unsuccessfully defended Rotherham, who will feel the full force of financial relegations should they are to drop into League One. The punishment means they are now only one point ahead of the Championship relegation zone with two games left. Rotherham drew 1-1 with Fulham last Wednesday, which left them four points above the relegation zone . Rotherham\u2019s scenario has set-up a tantalising end to the campaign, bringing two teams who appeared doomed back into play. Wigan lie on 39 points, Millwall 40 and Rotherham 41 before this Saturday\u2019s fixtures. Steve Evans\u2019 side have a tough trip to Norwich, while Millwall host Derby and Wigan play Wolves at the DW Stadium. All three opponents still have things to play for in the final two weeks of the season. Derby can secure a play-off place on Saturday, with Norwich still gunning for automatic promotion and Wolves retaining an outside chance of a top-six berth.",

        "article": "A senior Secret Service supervisor has been placed on indefinite administrative leave and is not allowed to enter the office after a female employee accused him of assaulting her at agency headquarters. The female agent alleged that she was attending a party with Xavier Morales, her boss, in a Washington, D.C. restaurant when he said he loved her and  wanted to have sex with her. After the two employees returned to the office from the party, Morales, 48, tried to kiss the woman and grabbed her arms when she resisted, according to two people briefed on her statement. Secret Service supervisor Xavier Morales, 48, has been placed on indefinite administrative leave after a female employee accused him of assaulting her at agency headquarters . The woman alleged that Morales did not relent until after a brief struggle, according to the Washington Post. The party, held on March 31 at the Capitol City Brewing Company, was being thrown in Morales' honor to celebrate his recent assignment to head the Louisville Secret Service field office. Morales, who was a manager in the agency's security clearance division, was due to start his new position this week. Instead, he had to turn in his gun and badge and had his security clearance suspended after Secret Service internal investigators began a preliminary review and conducted interviews in regards to the female agent's complaint, according to agency spokesman Brian Leary. Secret Service Director Joseph P. Clancy released a statement to the Washington Post saying the 'allegations as reported are very disturbing'. 'The Secret Service is an agency that demands that our employees conduct themselves with the highest level of integrity,' he said. 'Any threats or violence that endangers our employees in the workplace is unacceptable and will not be tolerated.' Clancy had his investigators refer the case to the Department of Homeland Security's inspector general, due to Morales' high rank. D.C. police have also been contacted due to the criminal nature of the allegations. The incident has come barely a month after two Secret Service employees crashed a government car into a White House barricade after drinking at an agency retirement party nearby. Morales, who is married to a longtime special agent, was responsible for determining which agents should lose their security clearance or jobs because of misconduct or other reason. The new position he was meant to start this week is considered a major stepping stone within the agency. The female agent (not pictured) alleged  she was attending a party with Morales (pictured at a Hispanic American Police Command Officers Association event ) when he said he loved her and wanted to have sex .",

        "article": "Poppy Smart complained to police after accusing builders of sexual harassment for wolf-whistling . When Poppy Smart was wolf-whistled at by builders on her walk to work, she at first tried to ignore it. But as the whistles and accompanying sexist comments turned into a daily ritual, the 23-year-old began to get upset. Finally, after a month of unwanted attention from the men on the building site, the marketing co-ordinator decided she'd had enough \u2013 and called the police. Miss Smart, who recorded the constant whistling using her smartphone's video function, also contacted one of the construction companies working at the site to complain of sexual harassment. She compared the wolf-whistling to racial discrimination and said it made her walk to work in Worcester city centre an 'awful experience'. One of the workers even approached her on the pavement, blocking her way, before saying 'Morning love' after she had ignored a cacophony of whistling, Miss Smart said. 'He was probably 18 or 19 and got right in my face, standing next to an older man. He didn't touch me but they were in my personal space in the pavement, in my way, even though I literally blanked him. It is incredibly intimidating. I'm quite a nervous person and this has made my anxiety worse. 'The whistling went on for a month. I eventually contacted the building company and the police on the same day when it got so bad. I even considered changing my route to work but thought, 'Why should I do that?' West Mercia police confirmed they had followed up Miss Smart's complaint as a possible incident of anti-social behaviour but had not taken further action. A spokesman said: 'After consultation with the woman who reported the behaviour it was decided that the employers would deal with those said to be responsible.' Although wolf-whistling is not a specific offence, workmen who repeatedly make obscene comments to passers-by could be convicted of a breach of the peace. Miss Smart, from Worcester, was first whistled at in the middle of February when she started a new job. Ms Smart recorded one of the occasions she walked past the building site. There is no suggestion any of the men pictured in the mobile phone footage (shown left and right) were involved in the alleged wolf-whistling . The builders concerned were working on the expansion of the Bolero restaurant. Miss Smart said she had not seen the men responsible since she complained to the building company, Fimeca. The firm's boss was 'shocked and annoyed' at his staff's behaviour and asked her to contact him if there was a repeat, she said. Fimeca Building and Maintenance, of Pershore, Worcestershire, said the matter was being dealt with by the firm's solicitors but refused to comment further. Miss Smart said she had been targeted on other occasions in Worcester, not just near the building site.

'Disrespectful': The 23-year-old marketing co-ordinator (pictured) claimed builders at a construction site wolf-whistled at her every morning as she walked to work in Worcester city centre . 'Men will lean out of their cars or vans and shout comments about my appearance or whistle and I have seen this happen to others as well. I don't think such comments, even if they are considered complimentary by the perpetrators, are appropriate. It makes walking through town an awful experience.' In 2012, David Cameron insisted wolf-whistling would not be made illegal in Britain despite signing the UK up to the Council of Europe's convention on violence against women, which pledges to outlaw 'verbal, non-verbal or physical' sexual harassment. At the time, Mr Cameron's official spokesman said: 'We have harassment laws in this country. We are not proposing to criminalise wolf-whistling.' Sarah Green, of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said wolf-whistling represented 'everyday sexism' which should be stamped out. 'Sexual harassment in the street is too often regarded as trivial when the reality is that many women feel humiliated, insulted and sometimes intimidated by it,' she said. 'Men who respect women do not do it.' Wolf-whistles, which originated among sailors, have now been banned by a number of building firms.

        "article": "It has been 40 years since the historic evacuation of the of Saigon as the North Vietnamese army descended upon the city, and among the many stories of heroism and bravery is that of a father who piloted a military helicopter to fly his family to safety. Ba Van Nguyen was able to fly a CH-47 Chinook, the largest helicopter in the South Vietnamese army, with his three young children and wife out of the city and into the South China Sea where they were all ultimately saved by the USS Kirk. This after Nguyen somehow managed to pilot the helicopter while getting out of his flight suit and jumping into the ocean just seconds before it crashed - all on his own. Scroll down for videos . Histo4ric:\u00a0Ba Van Nguyen piloted a military helicopter (above) on his own to save his family during the fall of Saigon on April 30, 1975 . Saved: He flew towards the USS Kirk which was too small to allow the helicopter to land, and so he hoovered over as his family (daughter circled in red) safely jumped out . Helping hand: Sailors on the ship caught the family (above) as they jumped out . In an interview with CNN, some members of the family are revealing what happened on that historic day, and their lives in the years after. They were also part of the PBS special, The Last Days of Vietnam. On April 29, 1975, Nguyen moved his family to his mother-in-law's house, telling them he would be back the next day in the Chinook, and that they would hear him coming when he was close. 'If you hear a Chinook coming, get ready,' Nguyen told his wife. When he arrived later that morning, his family and a few friends got on - as gunfire from the communist forces grew louder and louder as they came closer to the city - and flew out towards the water. Shortly after however, they realized they were running low on fuel, and that is when Nguyen reached out to the Kirk asking for permission to land. 'I must land or crash into the sea,' Nguyen said. 'Please help us.' Bravery: Nguyen then flew back out to sea (above) and jumped from the helicopter . Safe: He managed to avoid the large amounts of shrapnel (above) when the plan crashed . Heading back: A motorboat soon grabbed him from the sea (above) as he wore just a shirt and his boxers . The Kirk however was not large enough to withstand the force of such a large helicopter, which would likely sink the ship and cause the death of everyone onboard. And so it was decided that Nguyen would at least try and save his family. He hoovered over the ship as every passenger jumped onto the deck and were caught by sailors, including his wife and three young children. That is when he went back out to sea and managed to do the impossible and somehow pilot alone, get out of his suit and jump into the water seconds before the helicopter crashed and sent shrapnel flying everywhere. Seconds later, he appeared in the water, wearing nothing but his boxer shorts and a shirt. Hos one possession, some gold he had in his pocket, had fell out and sunk in the South China Sea. 'We couldn't figure out how he did it; he was a Houdini,' said Hugh Doyle, the chief engineering officer. A motorboat was sent out to retrieve him, and moments later he was reunited with his family. The Nguyen family would be part of the 30,000 South Vietnamese refugees ultimately rescued by the Kirk. 'It was a happy ending to a shi**y war,' said\u00a0Kent Chipman, one of the sailors on the Kirk. Unbelievable: Nguyen somehow managed to operate the plane and it's intricate system (above) alone after everyone jumped . Over: 'It was a happy ending to a shi**y war,' said Kent Chipman, one of the sailors on the Kirk of Nguyen's (above) feat . That was just the beginning for Nguyen though, who now had to start over in America and try to support his family. He did not know the language and he had no money, but he was able to eventually land a job as a technician at Boeing in Seattle. According to his children he was strict, but also self-sufficient and proud, getting the family off government assistance after just a few months and encouraging hard work above all else. 'Your mother and I came to the United States with nothing but my drawers,' he would tell his children. 'Look at where we are today. We are not wealthy. But we are not poor.' He was reunited with the crew from the USS Kirk in 2009, finally revealing his identity after keeping it secret for years, and awarded an air medal for bravery. 'He was staring at me and I was staring at him. He knew and I just knew,' said Chipman of the emotional reunion, this despite the fact that Nguyen was already in the throes of Alzheimer's. It was then that his children were able to see just what their father had accomplished as footage of the day was shared by some of the men who had filmed the incident. Then, three years later, following a remarkable life, Nguyen passed away. He was 73-years-old.",

Fighters from 100 nations \u2013 more than half the countries in the world \u2013 have joined militant groups such as Al Qaeda and Islamic State, according to research by the United Nations. Worryingly, the report warned if IS was defeated in the war-torn region then the barbarous foreign fighters could be scattered across the world. Scroll down for video . More than 20,000 foreign fighters from more than half the countries in the world have joined militant groups such as Al Qaeda and Islamic State, according to a report by the United Nations . The number of foreign fighters worldwide soared by a staggering 71 per cent between the middle of 2014 and March 2015 after IS gained significant territory. Syria and Iraq were by far the biggest destinations, with over 20,000 foreign fighters travelling to the region to fight for mainly IS but also the Al-Nusra Front. The panel said the thousands of foreign fighters who travelled to both countries are living and working in \u2018a veritable \u201cinternational finishing school\u201d for extremists\u2019 as was the case in Afghanistan in the 1990s. Afghan security forces estimated in March \u2013 three months after British troops withdrew - that about 6,500 foreign fighters were active in the country. And it said hundreds of foreigners are fighting in Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, around 100 in Somalia, and others in the Sahel countries in northern Africa, and in the Philippines. The panel of experts monitoring UN sanctions against Al-Qaeda said in the report that the scale of the problem has increased over the past three years and the flow of foreign fighters \u2018is higher than it has ever been historically\u2019. The number of foreign fighters worldwide soared by a staggering 71 per cent between the middle of 2014 and March 2015 after IS gained significant territory . The overall number of foreign terrorist fighters has \u2018risen sharply from a few thousand ... a decade ago to more than 25,000 today,\u2019 the panel said in the report to the UN Security Council. A military defeat of the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq could have the unintended consequence of scattering foreign terrorist fighters across the world, the panel said. It noted that the \u2018watch list\u2019 in Turkey - a key crossing point to Syria and Iraq - now includes 12,500 individuals. And while governments are focusing on countering the threat from fighters returning home, the panel said it\u2019s possible that some may be traumatised by what they saw and need psychological help. Others may be recruited by criminal networks. The number of countries the fighters come from has also risen dramatically from a small group in the 1990s to over 100 today, including some that have never had previous links with Al-Qaeda associated groups, the panel said. It cited the \u2018high number\u2019of foreign fighters from Tunisia, Morocco, France and Russia, the increase in fighters from the Maldives, Finland and Trinidad and Tobago, and the first fighters from some countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Syria and Iraq were by far the biggest destinations, with fighters mainly travelling to the region to fight for  IS but also the Al-Nusra Front (pictured, a fighter from the Al-Qaeda linked militant group) The panel said the fighters and their networks \u2018pose an immediate and long-term threat\u2019 and \u2018an urgent global security problem\u2019 that needs to be tackled on many fronts and has no easy solution. With globalised travel, it said, the chance of a person from any country becoming a victim of a foreign terrorist attack \u2018is growing, particularly with attacks targeting hotels, public spaces and venues\u2019. But the panel noted that a longstanding terrorist goal is \u2018generating public panic\u2019 and stressed that the response needs to \u2018be measured, effective and proportionate.\u2019 It said the most effective policy is to prevent the radicalization, recruitment and travel of would-be fighters. The panel noted that less than 10 per cent of basic information to identify foreign fighters has been put in global systems and called for greater intelligence sharing.",

        "article": "(CNN)If I had to describe the U.S.-Iranian relationship in one word it would be \"overmatched.\" We're playing checkers on the Middle East game board and Tehran's playing three-dimensional chess. Iran has no problem reconciling its bad and contradictory behavior while we twist ourselves into knots over our tough choices, all the while convincing ourselves that America's policy on the nuclear issue is on the right track. Iran isn't 10 feet tall in this region, but by making the nuclear issue the be-all and end-all that is supposed to reduce Iran's power, the United States is only making Tehran taller. Consider the following: . The U.S.-Iranian relationship is not symmetrical. It's not as if we both are doing terrible things and are looking for a fair and equitable compromise to stop our respective bad behaviors. Iran is about to try a U.S. citizen and Washington Post reporter and we have made a judgment that even while we protest, we will keep the nuclear issue separated not just from this case but from Iran's serial abuse of human rights, including  the behavior of its Shia militias in Iraq. I can only hope there is a carefully orchestrated behind-the-scenes plan to have Iran release Jason Rezaian. If not, we're legitimizing a bad regime and compromising U.S. values and interests  in the process by not ensuring that all Americans being held by Iran come out as part of the nuclear deal. America is alienating some of our closest allies because of the Iran deal, and Iran is picking up new ones and bolstering relations with old ones who are growing more dependent because they see Iran's power rising. Our friends aren't perfect, particularly the Saudis and even the Israelis. But we need them precisely because Iran is rising. Sadly, the administration is sending signals that cutting a deal on the nuclear issue takes precedence over their priorities. In the meantime, Iran's allies, Bashar al-Assad's Syria, Hezbollah and now the Houthis -- not proxies, but instruments of convenience -- see what's happening and are willing to play and cooperate even more in the Iranian game. The Russians, too, realize that the nuclear issue gives them cover to sell sophisticated missile defense systems and soon to export even more to gain influence and hard currency. We're  losing friends; Iran is gaining them. And in one of the cruelest ironies, Iran's way back into the global economy is as a result of the very issue that made it such a pariah: the nuclear issue. As the Arab world melts down and lacks a traditional epicenter of strength and power, (Egypt, Iraq, Syria), Iran is rising. The argument here is not that Iran is taking over the Middle East. But in its zone of influence, a zone critical to the United States -- Syria, Iraq, the Gulf, Yemen, Lebanon -- it is expanding its influence, not contracting. Washington doesn't play this kind of game well. It is tripping all over itself trying to figure out how to combat ISIS in Syria and yet not empower al-Assad (no answer), how to combat ISIS in Iraq without favoring the Shia-dominated government and alienating Iraqi Sunnis (no answer)and how to backstop the Saudis in Yemen without enabling them to make matters worse through their airstrikes (no answer). Iran has a much easier time managing contradictions. Indeed, it can use the threat of ISIS to keep the Americans away from weakening their ally al-Assad as well as expand its influence in Iraq under the guise of fighting a battle of mutual interest. Battle group naval assets to the Gulf of Aden notwithstanding, the United States is being outfoxed, not outgunned. Don't expect U.S. ships to stop those of Iran. As State Department spokesperson Marie Harf said, \"There are reports about these U.S. ships that have been moved and I want to be very clear just so that no one has the wrong impression. They are not there to intercept Iranian ships. The purpose of moving them is only to ensure that the shipping lanes remain open and safe. I think there was some misreporting and confusion on this. I just want to be very clear that the purpose is not to do anything in terms of those Iranian ships.\" It clearly makes sense to try to use diplomacy as a way to constrain Iran's nuclear program. But we should have no illusions about two things. First, we won't end Teheran's nuclear weapons pretensions, and two, we are and will be enabling its rise in the region because of this nuclear diplomacy, not constraining it.  One of the reasons the United States won't strike al-Assad is for fear of emboldening ISIS, but the other is that we don't want a proxy war with Iran in Syria. As the Russians have made clear in their recent S-300 deal, the nuclear negotiations are only making Iran a more acceptable business partner. And the real fruits of the diplomacy haven't even begun yet. Sanctions relief will make the mullahs more secure and give them the resources to buck up, not tamp down, their regional aspirations. We've made our bed, apparently, and now are going to have to find a way to sleep. A nuclear deal will avert a crisis over the nuclear issue for now. But unless it really does change Iran's behavior, we've only bought ourselves a bigger one down the road.",

Twice the teenage winger visited the national stadium to cheer on his boyhood club in 2010 but Villa lost both times, to Manchester United in the League Cup final and Chelsea in the FA Cup final four. Grealish, 19, was handed his first Premier League start by Tim Sherwood in the 3-3 draw with Queens Park Rangers and is hopeful of retaining his place for the April 19 date. Jack Grealish made his first Premier League start for Aston Villa against QPR on Tuesday night . Grealish saw Villa lose twice at Wembley in 2010 - in the League Cup final and in the FA Cup semi-final . \u2018I went twice to Wembley as a fan, the Man U game and Chelsea game five years ago,\u2019 said Grealish. \u2018Unfortunately we didn\u2019t win either of them, hopefully this time we can go and get a result. \u2018It would be brilliant to stay in the team for Wembley but at the end of the day the gaffer will pick who he thinks he will win. I go with the flow. \u2018To start for my boyhood club was a dream come true. I hope towards the end of the season I can play more of a part and help the team stay in the division.\u2019 Wayne Rooney scores for United as Villa were beaten 2-1 in the 2010 League Cup final at Wembley . Frank Lampard finds the target during Villa's 3-0 defeat by Chelsea in the FA Cup semi-final in 2010 .

        "article": "A young woman who ate just 10 calories a day while in the grip of anorexia has spoken of how she fought her way back from the brink of death. Beth Hall, 24, from Cambridge, plummeted to a tiny 4st 13lb after battling the horrific eating disorder since her teenage years - while working in a chocolate shop. Tormented by bullies at school, she began a strict diet regime at the age of 16, living off nothing more than black tea and coffee. Determined to lose weight, she would often go for up to three days without eating a single thing. But after years of turmoil, she was finally admitted to an eating disorder clinic. And after making a full recovery, she is now a healthy size 8 and studying graphics at university. Scroll down for video . Beth Hall, now 24, from Cambridge, plummeted to a tiny 4st 13lbs (left) after being bullied at school. She has now gained weight to be a size 8 (right) At the height of her anorexia, Miss Hall would live on just 10 calories a day - or go three days without eating a single thing . Miss Hall said: 'I'm so relieved that I have managed to maintain a healthy weight after battling anorexia. 'It didn't matter how many pounds I dropped, I would always see a fat pig when I looked in the mirror. 'I would ditch my lunch at school and when my mum was diagnosed with skin cancer in 2008 I was able to disguise my eating habits as she was having treatment in hospital.' She admits she would go up to three days without eating a single thing - but remained adamant there was nothing wrong with her. 'I lived on black coffee and tea which is around 10 calories per day, I was starving my body so badly that I couldn't even think straight,' she recalled. Miss Hall was forced to drop out of university in 2009 after her eating disorder took control of her life and she struggled to cope with the work load. She added: 'I couldn't focus on anything but food, my illness was completely out of control and I was getting thinner and thinner by the day. 'I eventually got a job as a sales assistant, ironically in a chocolate shop but I was so weak and I didn't know how much more my body would take.' Then in 2011, she developed a kidney infection, leading doctors to warn she was risking her life by starving her body. Beth said: 'The doctor told me he could feel all my organs underneath my skin and that I would end up killing myself if my eating didn't improve. 'I suddenly realised that I needed help and at just 4st 13lbs, I was admitted to an eating disorder ward once my kidney infection cleared up. She said:\u00a0'I lived on black coffee and tea which is around 10 calories per day, I was starving my body so badly that I couldn't even think straight'. Miss Hall is pictured now at a healthy weight . It was only when a doctor warned he could feel all of her organs underneath her skin - and that she would end up killing herself if she didn't eat - that she sought help . 'I hated having to gain weight and eating the meals they had given me but I knew I needed to be there.' This, combined with daily group therapy sessions, saw her begin to make progress - and after four months at the eating disorder clinic, she was allowed home. 'I was finally in control of my own meals again and could attend the therapy sessions as an outpatient,' said Miss Hall. Despite suffering a relapse one year later she is now back at university and working part-time. She said: 'I'm now studying graphic design at Anglia Ruskin University in Cambridge. 'I did suffer a relapse, but the therapy sessions gave me the coping skills I needed to get my eating habits back under control.' She added: 'My whole family, including my younger sister, Georgina, were so worried about me when my weight dropped so drastically. 'It has been a massive relief for everyone that I have been able to get my weight under control and that I'm a healthy size 8. 'I know my illness will always be there but I know how to deal with it all now. 'I hope other girls who read my story are able to gain hope from everything I have achieved. 'There is always help available and, despite how isolated you feel, things will get better and you can overcome an eating disorder.' Miss Hall said:\u00a0'I hope other girls who read my story are able to gain hope from everything I have achieved.

Argentinian con-artist Sofia Davila posted raunchy pictures or herself online and then flirted with unsuspecting men she had contacted on the social network, suggesting they meet up for sex. But after meeting her victims, the 21-year-old from Buenos Aires, would spike their drinks and wait for them to fall unconscious, before ransacking their homes. Buenos Aires thief Sofia Davila, 21, would start chatting to men over Facebook before suggesting that they meet up. When they did, she would spike their drinks and rob their homes after they fell unconscious . The 21-year-old posted raunchy pictures of herself on Facebook and flirt with strangers she added on the network. She was caught after trying to trick police that she was an innocent bystanders in the robberies . Diego Escalante, from Tigre, Buenos Aires, said he had been robbed after falling victim to the ploy. The 39-year-old said: 'We had been flirting with each other for about two weeks and then she suggested we get together. 'We went to a hotel and had a good time and when she suggested we meet again I didn't think anything was suspicious. 'The next time we met she came to my place and said she'd like to drink her own alcohol and poured me one too. I then began to fill ill and passed out. 'When I woke up my feet and hands were tied and there were two men in my flat taking my TV, stereo and other things.' After carrying out the ruse Davila went to the police station herself to report the robbery - claiming she had been forced to leave the flat by the men, and had been powerless to stop them. The thief has been nicknamed the 'Black Widow of Facebook'. She is now awaiting trial after admitting tricking 15 men and robbing them. Two of her accomplices will also appear in court over the crimes . But a spokesman for the police said they were suspicious, having received numerous calls from men who had been stolen from after they spent the night with a woman they met over the internet . He said: 'The problem with her statement was that we had already received a dozen complaints from other men saying they had been robbed after meeting a woman over Facebook. 'This was the first time the woman had actually shown up herself though, but because she matched the description we already had we decided to hold her for questioning. One of Davila's victims said the pair hit it off at a hotel, and he didn't think have any suspicions when they met up again at his home. He said she drugged him and he woke up with his feet tied and two men stealing his TV . 'As soon as we spoke to the victim we knew she was the woman behind the robberies and it only took a little while before we had a full confession. We also found that the man had been drugged.' Davila admitted to bedding and robbing more than 15 men and is now awaiting trial along with her two accomplices. Argentinian news website DiarioVeloz.com\u00a0said Davila, who worked in PR for a bowling alley, told police she was forced to commit the crimes to pay off her debts to a drug dealer .",

        "article": "Antarctica has experienced its highest temperature on record, according to meteorologists. Sensors at Argentina's Esperanza Base on the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula recorded a temperature of 17.5\u00b0C (63.5\u00b0F). According to meteorologists this is potentially a new record for the warmest temperature measured on the frozen continent. The new temperature record was measured on the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula (pictured) where the ice shelf covering the sea has declined considerably in recent years and glaciers are thought to be receding . Over a two day period last week temperatures reached 17.4\u00b0C (63.3\u00b0F) and 17.5\u00b0C (63.5\u00b0F). However, the heatwave on the coldest continent on Earth has still to be officially certified by the World Meteorological Organisation. Antarctica's icy edge is disappearing in warming ocean waters, with the last decade seeing the rate of ice loss increase dramatically. This is according to a new study that has combined 18-years worth of ice shelf thinning data from three different sets of satellites. The researchers claim that some ice shelves in West Antarctica have lost as much as 18 per cent of their volume in the last ten years. Satellite data from 1994 to . 2012 clearly shows the accelerating decline which could hasten the rise in global sea levels, . scientists say. The findings come amid concern among many scientists about the effects of . global climate change on Earth's vast, remote polar regions. The previous hottest temperature recorded in Antarctica - which is usually the coldest place on Earth - was in April 24 1961 when the temperature reached 17.1\u00b0C (62.8\u00b0F). Writing for website Weather Underground, meteorologist Dr Jeff Masters said: 'A new all-time temperature record for an entire continent is a rare event. 'This week's record temperatures were made possible by an unusually extreme jet stream contortion that brought a strong ridge of high pressure over the Antarctic Peninsula, allowing warm air from South America to push southwards over Antarctica. 'At the surface, west to east blowing winds over the Antarctic Peninsula rose up over the 1,000-foot high mountains just to the west of Esperanza Base, then descended and warmed via adiabatic compression (without transfer of heat) into a warm foehn wind (a warm dry wind that blows down a slope).' Antarctica is known as the coldest place on Earth where temperatures have dropped to -93.2\u00b0C (-135.8\u00b0F) on the East Antarctic Plateau. The graphic above shows rates of thickness change around the Antarctic coastline with areas of most loss in the past 18 years indicated by red circles and areas where ice has increased shown by blue circles . However, the Antarctic Peninsula is one of the fastest warming spots on Earth. While most of the continent has experienced an increase in ice sheet mass, nearly 10,000 square miles of ice has been lost from the ice shelves off coast of the Peninsula. Glaciers extending out from the fjords of the Antarctic Peninsula have also been retreating, according to researchers. Climate scientists have blamed the changes happening there on human-generated global warming. The collapse of the Larson B shelf (shown above) on the Antarctic Peninsula is one example of the changes that have been taking place on the continent in recent years and have caused concern among some scientists . Marine sediment cores suggest the changes happening in the area are unprecedented at least in the past 10,000 years. Dr Masters said last week's heatwave matched a trend occurring around the world. He said that in 2015 five nations or territories have now set all time records or matched their records for hottest temperatures in history. He added that 46 nations or territories, out of 235, have set or tied all time heat records since 2010. However, despite the new record temperature, climate scientists are urging caution about drawing conclusions from it. This graphic shows how warm water from the ocean may be increasing the flow of glaciers from the Antarctic ice sheet as they cause melting from below while fresh snow accumulates on top of the ice sheet . Gavin Schmidt, a climate scientist with Nasa's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York, told National Geographic that last year Antarctica also logged a record cold temperature. He said that long term climate changes in Antarctica are complex and still have not been complained properly. The new record will also depend on what scientists regard as being Antarctica. Currently the World Meteorological Society records the warmest temperature on the continent as being at Vanda Station on the opposite side Antarctica on 1 May 1974 when temperatures reached\u00a015\u00b0C (59\u00b0F).",

Benedict Cumberbatch, who played Turing in the Oscar-nominated The Imitation Game, said:\u00a0'Alan Turing was a war hero, who broke the Enigma code helping to bring an end to World War II, the father of modern computing science, and a gay icon who lived in a time of intolerance and tragically committed suicide as a result. 'His impact on our everyday lives is enormous, and the thought of holding a manuscript by him is thrilling.' The notebook was among the papers he left in his will to friend and fellow mathematician Robin Gandy. Turing (left) wrote the notes at the Bletchley Park code-breaking headquarters in 1942 and they paved the way for computer science. The notes are believed to be the only extensive Turing manuscript (right) known to exist, the auctioneer said . Pages of notes show the inner workings of Turing's thoughts as he helped break codes and decipher tests . The notes, which are highly personal, show Turing working through different equations and considering different results . Gandy gave the papers to The Archive Centre at King's College in Cambridge in 1977. But he kept the notebook, using its blank pages for writing down his dreams at the request of his psychiatrist. Bonham describes Gandy's entries as highly personal; the notebook remained in his possession until he died in 1995. At the beginning of his journal, Gandy writes: 'It seems a suitable disguise to write in between these notes of Alan's on notation, but possibly a little sinister; a dead father figure, some of whose thoughts I most completely inherited.' In a statement through Bonhams, Turing scholar Andrew Hodges said the notebook sheds more light on how Turing 'remained committed to free-thinking work in pure mathematics.' Benedict Cumberbatch, who played Turing in the Oscar-nominated The Imitation Game (left), said: 'The thought of holding a manuscript by him is thrilling' In some Turing elaborates on his conclusions, writing that one result 'is too subtle and makes an inconvenient definition' He added: 'Alan Turing was parsimonious with his words and everything from his pen has special value.' Turing committed suicide in 1954. He was gay at a time when homosexuality was illegal in Britain and was convicted of indecency in 1952. He agreed to undergo hormone treatment as an alternative to imprisonment to 'cure' his homosexuality. It will be sold by Bonhams in New York on Monday. It said the seller wished to remain anonymous.

But that iconic photo\u00a0opportunity has been consigned to history after a Swiss town bans selfies with the giant rescue\u00a0dogs. Zermatt in the Upper Valais area of Switzerland has imposed the ban after a report from an animal welfare charity alleged the dogs were kept in 'miserable conditions'. Scroll down for video . Posing with dogs like these St Bernards has now been banned by the Swiss town of Zermatt . According to the Swiss Animal Protection Agency, the St Bernard dogs are being kept as tourist props by a company in the town that treats them very badly. The organisation has carried out investigations into the conditions the dogs were being kept since 2012 and published a report earlier this year. The report said said when they were not being taken out on excursions with tourists, the dogs \u00a0were being kept locked up in confined conditions in an unheated condemned building for long periods of time. It claimed the dogs are left without food or water in foul smelling conditions and are not given enough exercise. When they are put on show, \u00a0the dogs are kept in the cold for long periods of time and quickly grow tired while posing for photographs, sometimes with children riding on their backs. The organisation has been calling for the town council of Zermatt to ban the use of the dogs for many years. In a statement, SAP said the town's decision showed it 'loves the animals'. Zermatt, under the shadow of the Matterhorn is a popular tourist desitnations . It said: 'SAP rejoices that the town of Zermatt has now taken action to ban taking pictures of St Bernard dogs in its territory. 'Zematt has shown that it loves the animals and it will put an end to the contemptible and dangerous shows these dogs were made part of by being used as tourist props. 'For several years, the SAP, and its section working in the Upper Valais have criticised the conditions in which these animals are kept, and time and time again, has complained about those who keep the animals in captivity, for their violation of laws on the protection of animals. 'The SAP will continue to do all its can to make sure these dogs, which at the moment are housed in a condemned building in miserable conditions flout animal protection rules, are kept in comfortable conditions that meet their needs. 'The SPA is offering its help on the condition those holding the owners decided to put these dogs in better accommodation after they have been used purely as objects for hire.' The mayor of the town, Christophe B\u00fcrgin, told Swiss radio station Walliser Bote: 'No Saint Bernard dogs will be used for photo shoots with tourists on the peaks of Gornergrat and Sunnegga. 'We have been able to convince providers that it is not right to continue to offer pictures in that way.' He said over the summer a few dogs might be found because of long-term contracts with tour operators but the practice will be stamped out by next winter. In March the association filed a legal complaint against the St Bernard owners, claiming that the dogs\u2019 living and working conditions were abusive.

Leila Alavi had taken out an apprehended violence order against her ex-husband Mokthar Hosseiniamraei . Her body was found by a distressed colleague inside her Holden Astra with initial examination suggesting Ms Alavi had suffered a knife wound to the throat. A spokeswoman for the advocacy group SOS Women's Services, Roxanne McMurray, told the Sydney Morning Herald that Ms Alavi would likely have been able to survive the violence if she was given access to a refuge at the time of her search.

        "article": "Baghdad, Iraq (CNN)Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri, a former top deputy to Saddam Hussein and more recently a key figure in Sunni extremist groups battling the Iraqi government, has been killed in a security operation in that country, Iraqi state-run television reported Friday. Al-Douri was the highest-ranking member of Hussein's regime to evade capture -- the \"King of Clubs\" in a deck of playing cards used by American troops to identify the most-wanted regime officials. He also was a man thought to have led the post-Hussein Sunni extremist group Naqshbandi Army. Military analysis website Globalsecurity.org says the Naqshbandi Army supports ISIS, which has taken over parts of Iraq and Syria. Al-Douri was killed in an operation by Iraqi security forces and Shia militia members in the Hamrin Mountains between Tikrit and Kirkuk, Iraq, Shia militia commander Hadi al-Ameri said. That militia is a predominantly Shiite fighting group that worked with Iraqi troops earlier this month to liberate the Iraqi city of Tikrit from ISIS. The death of al-Douri was also reported by the governor of Salahuddin province, Raid al-Jubouri, who spoke by phone on Iraqi television. Al-Douri's body arrived Friday in Baghdad, where DNA samples were taken to confirm the identity, said the spokesman of another Shiite militia called Hashd Shaabi in an interview with state-run Iraqiya TV. DNA test results could be available in 48 hours, Hashd Shaabi spokesman Yousuf al-Kilabi told the outlet. The U.S. military is aware of the media reports but doesn't have further information to evaluate them, said Col. Patrick Ryder, spokesman for U.S. Central Command. While officials are aware of al-Douri's role in the Hussein regime, Ryder declined to comment about whether the United States or the coalition was targeting any specific individuals. Al-Douri was a military commander and vice chairman of the country's revolutionary command council in Hussein's Sunni-dominated regime -- effectively Hussein's No. 2 man. Hussein's regime fell during a U.S.-led invasion in 2003. The U.S. military had said that after the Iraqi leader's fall, al-Douri helped finance a Sunni insurgency with money he transferred to Syria before the government collapsed. A month before the invasion, al-Douri presided over a military parade in Mosul, an event covered by CNN, and his participation became one of the last times he was seen in public, covered by CNN. Al-Douri saluted troops from the reviewing stand as they marched by. Then, just days before the U.S. invasion, al-Douri addressed an emergency summit of the Organization of the Islamic Conference to discuss ultimately unsuccessful ways to avert the war. Al-Douri accused the United States of aggression and blamed Kuwait for his country's suffering, calling leaders of the neighboring Gulf state \"traitors\" for cooperating with the United States and Israel. That comment prompted the Kuwaiti representative to stand up and protest, to which al-Douri countered, \"Shut up, sit down you small agent [of the U.S.], you monkey!\" Kuwaiti television cut away from the heated exchange and rejoined the conference later. Al-Douri's efforts were all in vain. The United States invaded Iraq on March 19, 2003, ousting Hussein, al-Douri and the entire regime. In subsequent years, several claims asserted that al-Douri was either killed or captured during the war and its aftermath. At the same time, a man claiming to be al-Douri released a number of audio messages over the years taunting Iraqi and U.S. officials. In 2012, a series of videos appeared online purporting to show al-Douri deriding the Shiite-led government that took over Iraq after Hussein's ouster. CNN couldn't independently verify the authenticity of those videos on YouTube or the identity of the man speaking, though he bore a striking resemblance to al-Douri. In the clips, the man who claimed to be al-Douri wore an olive military uniform and sat behind a desk with an Iraqi flag in the background. He derided Iraq's Shiite-dominated government, led by then-Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, as well as what he described as meddling by neighboring Iran. Al-Maliki's Dawa party, says al-Douri, \"has announced Iraq as the Shiite capital.\" At that time, nine years had passed since the invasion and, al-Douri claimed that Iraq was still in peril. \"Everyone can hear the sounds of danger echoing daily and threatening the country,\" he said. The videos were posted on what was the 65th anniversary of the Arab Socialist Baath Party, a political party founded in Syria that later provided the political basis for Hussein's now outlawed Baath Party.

        "article": "Arizona officials who botched an investigation into the rape of a 13-year-old girl - allowing her rapist to continue to assault her for four years - have agreed to pay her $3.5 million. The payout by Maricopa County, which was revealed on Wednesday, comes after it emerged that Patrick Morrison continued to assault the mentally-disabled girl, his niece, and even got her pregnant when detectives failed to properly investigate the case. Her rape was among more than 400 sex-crime cases that were inadequately investigated or not looked into at all by Sheriff Joe Arpaio's office over a three-year period ending in 2007. Morrison, from Mesa, first raped his niece Sabrina Morrison in March 2007, and after she told a teacher the following day, authorities performed a rape kit on her. Payout: Sabrina Morrison, pictured left in an interview in 2012, will receive $3.5 million after sheriff's deputies failed to arrest her uncle, Patrick Morrison, right, after he raped her when she was 13 . Even though the kit showed traces of semen, the sheriff's deputies did not collect a blood sample from Patrick Morrison - as requested by the lab - and left him walking the streets. Sabrina's mother, Vikki Morrison, said her daughter was known to make up stories, so when sheriff's deputies told her the rape kit had shown no evidence of a rape, she believed them. 'I was told straight to my face there was no evidence of any trauma or any sexual assault, so we thought she was lying the whole time,' she told\u00a0CBS5AZ in a 2012 interview. It meant that for the next four years, Morrison continued to rape his niece and even got her pregnant in 2009. But because of physical complications, the baby was aborted. He threatened to kill her if she told anyone about the assaults, Sabrina said as she spoke out about the ordeal in 2012. Her family said she was acting out so badly, that she was sent to live in a group home. Finally, four years after the initial attack, the case was re-opened and deputies gathered the blood sample from Morrison. The following year, he was arrested. Victim: Sabrina, pictured as a child, told a teacher she had been raped when she was 13 but authorities falsely said there was no evidence of the attack. It meant her uncle continued to rape her for four years . Locked up: The case was re-opened in 2011 and Morrison, pictured in court, was sentenced to 24 years . He pleaded guilty to one count of child molestation and two counts of attempted child molestation and was sentenced to 24 years in prison. 'That slipped through the cracks, we did due diligence after the fact that we found out, and we acted on it,' Sheriff Joe Arpaio explained at a Wednesday press conference. But the family was outraged. 'How do you feel when you find out your daughter's been telling you the truth and you didn't know it the whole time?' Vikki Morrison asked in the CBS interview. Sabrina's family filed a lawsuit against the department. The lawsuit alleged that the subsequent attacks on the girl could have been avoided if Arpaio's office arrested the suspect after he first abused her in March 2007. 'An eighth-grader could have solved this case,' attorney Charles Surrano said. 'They sat on the evidence, closed the case and never obtained the sample necessary to have the DNA testing done.' The decision to resolve the lawsuit marks the latest in a long string of legal settlements against Arpaio's office. Anger: Sabrina's mother, Vikki Morrison, said the sheriff's department had told her a rape kit showed there was no trace the teenager had been attacked, so she thought her daughter was lying . The county had previously paid more than $68 million in judgments, settlements and legal fees for the sheriff's office during Arpaio's 22-year tenure. Some settlements resolved lawsuits filed over the treatment of inmates in Arpaio's jails and the sheriff's failed corruption investigations of political foes. The settlement Wednesday applies only to Sabrina Morrison's lawsuit. It's unknown whether other victims in the botched investigations have filed similar lawsuits. The sheriff reflected on the legacy of the botched investigations at a Wednesday news conference, which was called to discuss a recent jail beating. 'We're talking about old history, but sometimes you learn from old history,' Arpaio said of the bungled cases. 'You try to do everything you can to hope that it never happens again.' He said he hopes the settlement money will go toward helping the victim and characterized the case's resolution as a good business decision, considering the girl's family had sought $30 million. Hot water: Her rape was among more than 400 sex-crime cases that were inadequately investigated or not looked into at all by the office of Sheriff Joe Arpaio (pictured) over a three-year period ending in 2007 . The sheriff apologized in December 2011 for the bungled cases, and his office has since said it has moved to clear up the investigation and taken steps to prevent the problem from happening again. An internal review attributed the failures to understaffing and mismanagement. A former supervisor says her investigators were pulled away from time to time to help with training efforts and Arpaio's immigrant-smuggling squad. But Maricopa County Supervisor Steve Gallardo said the sheriff failed to apologize to Sabrina Morrison as the settlement was reached, Fox10 reported. 'It's unconscionable that a mentally challenged girl be raped for four years\u2026 and law enforcement failed to act,' he said. The sheriff rejected the claim. '[Gallardo has] always been blasting me for the last five years, you don't think he'll say \"thank you Sheriff for rescuing all the animals,\" or \"Sheriff we feel sorry for your detectives\",' said Arpaio.",

        "article": "Hillary Rodham Clinton took aim at Republicans on Monday for latching on to a new book that details sweetheart deals she\u00a0allegedly made between foreign governments and the U.S. State Department in exchange for speaking fees and donations to her family foundation. 'It is, I think, worth noting that the Republicans seem to be talking only about me,' she told reporters in the liberal New Hampshire bastion of Keene. 'Hopefully we'll get on to the issues.' Clinton dismissed the swirling questions as little more than political attacks from Republicans eager to gain an early advantage in the 2016 presidential contest. And campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination, she pushed back hard. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . IT'S ME: Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton's chief complaint about Republicans is that they can't stop talking about her . DINING WITH THE 1 PER CENT: Clinton hobnobbed with Democratic officials last night in Concord at the home of a former state Senate president . 'We will be subjected to all kinds of distractions and attacks,' she told reporters after a roundtable event at a children's furniture factory. 'I'm ready for that. I know that that comes, unfortunately, with the territory.' She is making her first campaign visit this year to New Hampshire, a state beloved by the Clinton family for giving both her faltering 2008 effort and her husband's struggling 1992 campaign a second wind. She also took issue with economic views expressed by members of her own party, offering a dark assessment of a 'stalled out' U.S. recovery, a judgment at odds with President Barack Obama's brighter view of what the nation has achieved on his watch. 'It's not enough just to tread water,' she said. NOT READY FOR HILLARY: A lone protester vented his spleen at the New Hampshire Technical Institute while Clinton held a roundtable inside . In a traditional Democratic stand, she voiced her strong support for Social Security, a program some Republicans are eager to trim back, describing it as 'not a luxury' but 'a necessity.' Standing in front of wooden pallets and boxes of furniture parts, Clinton was asked by reporters about Peter Schweizer's coming book, 'Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich.' The book argues that the Clinton family got speaking fees and donations in return for favors to various foreign interests doled out while she was secretary of state. Sen. Rand Paul, a 2016 GOP candidate, said that would make people 'question whether she ought to run for president.' Republicans have spent months talking about financial dealings of the Clinton Foundation to raise questions about Hillary Clinton's character. She stepped down from the organization's board within hours of announcing her campaign. The foundation has come under scrutiny for accepting foreign contributions, including from Middle Eastern nations that deny equal rights for women. Some also are on the front lines in the fight against terrorism. Last week, the foundation revised its policy to permit donations from six U.S. allies in Europe, Australia, and North America but to bar giving from other nations. The charity supports public health, climate change and anti-poverty programs. Clinton campaign aides and supporters moved quickly to discredit Schweizer after word of his book emerged, casting him as a Republican operative working to defeat her. SCOOBY SIGHTING: Clinton's campaign van made an appearance in Concord, NH on Tuesday morning . A FEW TAKERS: Clinton shook hands with staffers at Kristin's Bistro and Bakery on Monday in Keene, NH \u2013 but some kitchen workers didn't want to come out to meet her . Schweizer is president of the Government Accountability Institute, a conservative organization, and has advised Republican politicians on foreign policy. 'He's cherry picked information that's been disclosed and woven a bunch of conspiracy theories about it,' Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta said on PBS. Though nearly two dozen Republicans are competing for their party's nomination, the GOP candidates have largely focused their criticism on Clinton. In New Hampshire on the weekend, they mocked her campaign stops, charged her with being overly secretive and even brought up her husband's affair with a White House intern.",

        "article": "Wojciech Szczesny must use his current spell out of the Arsenal side as a catalyst to come back a stronger goalkeeper, according to former club legend David Seaman. Szczesny has found himself demoted to the substitutes' bench in recent months due to a combination of poor performances and the form of David Ospina since the new year. Gunners boss Arsene Wenger has benefited from competition for places brought by the \u00a33.2 million signing of Colombian Ospina from Nice last summer, as eight consecutive wins have lifted his side to second in the Premier League. Wojciech Szczesny hasn't played a Premier League game since the 2-0 defeat to Southampton in January . David Ospina boasts the highest win ratio of any Premier League player to make more than 10 appearances . Szczesny is expected to line up in goal for Arsenal in Saturday's FA Cup semi-final against Reading at Wembley, and Seaman believes the Poland international can make the number one jersey his own once more. 'With Wojciech, it must be hard for him now to be number two, coming off the back of a season where he was a regular and had been playing at his best, but it is totally just because he had a couple of bad mistakes and Ospina has gone in and done his stuff,' Seaman said. 'Either of them could be Arsenal's number one, it is about who is on form - and if Ospina keeps his form, then he is going to stay there.' Former Arsenal goalkeeper David Seaman was speaking as an ambassador for the 'Know the Score' campaign against bowel cancer to Press Association Sport. Szczesny compounded his indifferent on-field performances by being caught smoking in the showers after defeat at Southampton on New Year's Day - the last time the 24-year-old started a league game for the North Londoners. But Seaman has every faith in the 6ft 5in deposed keeper, believing that if Szczesny takes the positives from a spell on the sidelines, he can emerge a far better goalkeeper in the years to come. The 51-year-old continued: 'It is not a difficult situation, but it keeps you on your toes to know that there is quality behind you. 'It is not just the games which make you play better, it is the training. 'The goalkeepers train together, and you see the other guy, you think \"I want to be better than him\" or \"I am going to show him how good I am\". That is day to day and is good because it brings the best out of you and tests you, so you become a better goalkeeper.' David Seaman is a former English goalkeeper who joined Arsenal from Queens Park Rangers in 1990 for \u00a31.3m, a then British record transfer fee for a goalkeeper. He spent 13 seasons at the Gunners, winning the old First Division Championship and the Premier League twice. Seaman also won four FA Cups, a League Cup and the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup during his time at Highbury. In all, he\u00a0made 564 appearances for the Gunners between 1990 and 2003, before joining Manchester City on a free transfer. A return of 11 wins from 12 starts has turned Ospina into a fans' favourite at the Emirates, but Seaman is only too aware of how quickly things can change in football, and has urged Szczesny to think carefully before making a decision on his future. 'Wojciech has a big choice now, but he has still got loads of time, I did not join Arsenal until I was 26,' said Seaman, who left Arsenal for Manchester City in 2003 after leading the Gunners to FA Cup glory over Southampton at the Millennium Stadium. 'It is about how he reacts, and what does the player want - does he want to play as a number one? Or is he happy being at a big club as a number two? 'It is all about his ambition. If he wants to be a number one somewhere, then how long is he going to have to wait? 'But if he leaves Arsenal, then it won't be the same level, because it is not until after they go, that all these guys realise how good Arsenal is.' When did Ospina join Arsenal? Arsenal signed Ospina from Ligue 1 side Nice last summer. The 26-year-old made close to 200 appearances for the French club during six seasons. How much did Arsenal pay for him? Originally signed as back-up and competition for Wojciech Szczesny after the Gunners No 2 Lukasz Fabianski joined Swansea, Ospina cost a paltry \u00a33million. Is he of international calibre? Ospina had won 52 caps for Colombia and impressed during their run to the World Cup quarter-final in Brazil last summer. When did Ospina make his first appearance for Arsenal? Ospina made his debut for Arsenal in a 2-1 defeat by Southampton in the third round of the\u00a0Capital\u00a0One\u00a0Cup back in September and only made one further appearance in the Champions League before 2015. When did he displace\u00a0Wojciech Szczesny as No 1? Ospina was recalled to the starting line-up as Arsenal beat Hull 2-0 in the FA Cup third round in January after Szczesny was at fault for both goals during a 2-0 defeat by Southampton. It later emerged that the Poland goalkeeper was caught smoking in the showers after the game. Ospina kept his place for the league game the following week and has played every Premier League match since. Did you know... Ospina is brother-in-law to Real Madrid midfielder and Colombia team-mate James Rodriguez. The former Monaco star married Ospina's sister Daniela in 2011.",

Mother-of-two Kelly Parsons, from Morden, south west London, has already enabled two couples to have twins and another woman give birth to a boy, thanks to her willingness to go through the painful donation procedure. In the space of 11 months, the 35-year-old's eggs have become twin girls, twin boys and a baby boy. Kelly Parsons, 35, from London (pictured with daughters Emily, four, (left) and 11-year-old Charlotte (right) has donate 50 of her eggs to help childless couples conceive . Kelly said: 'Despite the pain, it was worth it to bring joy to families that would never be able to have kids naturally. 'To have the urge to have kids and not be able to have them must be heartbreaking. I'm only a little part of making these babies. 'I am sure the parents will probably curse me in the middle of the night when they have to do bottle feeds.' Kelly and her train dispatcher husband Dean, 41, had a daughter, Charlotte, now 11, in 2003. After eight years of trying and three heartbreaking miscarriages, Kelly gave birth to daughter Emily in January 2011. Kelly then decided to start donating her eggs to other childless couples, in a bid to help as many families share the joys of children. Kelly and her husband Dean, 41, (second right) struggled for eight years to conceive Emily, with Kelly suffering three heartbreaking miscarriages . She said: 'I wanted the eggs to go to a husband and wife so that the kids would be raised in a similar environment to our family - after all, these eggs could have been my children. 'Dean wasn't totally on board but because I have supported him through so many crazy things, he knew it was my turn. 'You can only donate your eggs until you are 35, and because I was 33 at the time I felt like the clock was ticking.' Kelly injected herself twice a day with drugs to stop her period and stimulate her ovaries, and after a few months she will have stored up enough for them to be harvested. She said: 'After the first time I donated eggs I was knackered but so happy I'd done it. Kelly injected herself twice a day with drugs to stop her period and stimulate her ovaries . In all, the nurse has donated eggs three times, leading to three successful pregnancies - twin boys, twin girls, and a baby boy . 'A week later I got a call to say five of them had been fertilised and two had been implanted into the mum-to-be. 'They'd also frozen the others so they could have more kids in the future. 'From then on I was on tenterhooks, hoping her body would accept the embryos. 'Although I knew nothing about the couple, I really felt a connection to them.' In all, Kelly has donated eggs three times, leading to three successful pregnancies. Also, a number of her eggs have been frozen for future use. Controversially, Kelly has told her 11-year-old daughter that she has brothers and sisters. Controversially she has told her daughter Charlotte that she has brothers and sisters out there - and she has elected for her egg donor kids to be able to contact her daughters when they turn 18 . She also chose for the kids to be able to contact her daughters when they turn 18 - as she wants her girls to know their half siblings. She added: 'I would love to see if they look like me and am curious to meet them when they grow up. 'Charlotte is so excited by the thought she might get to meet her brothers and sisters one day. 'She even wants to donate her eggs because she thinks what I've done is amazing. 'The people that I've helped have babies have been through the menopause or cancer meaning they could never conceive naturally.

        "article": "Britain is likely to face a second election shortly after May 7 because of a knife-edge outcome, political experts have warned. The likelihood of another coalition lasting five years has been dismissed as miniscule by a leading academic. A second election swiftly after polling day is 'extremely likely', Professor Paul Whiteley of the University of Essex said. Britain is likely to face a second election shortly after May 7 because of a knife-edge outcome, political experts have warned . 'I don't see another coalition government lasting five years,' he said at a briefing by polling experts on the latest election forecasts. Other experts also warned that a 'messy and unstable' left-wing alliance was likely to be in power even if the Conservatives won more seats or a greater share of the vote. Mr Whiteley predicted a repeat of the disastrous Left-wing Lib-Lib pact of the 1970s. It ended with Labour Prime Minister James Callaghan losing a vote of no confidence. 'That was not very successful. It had to go to the IMF for a bail out and there were huge industrial problems.' The disastrous pact led to the rise of Margaret Thatcher and the Tories held on to power for another 18 years. Experts said the likeliest outcome at the general election would be the Conservatives winning the most votes, but a left-wing alliance forming to keep them out of power. Oxford academic Stephen Fisher said there was a high chance Labour would form either a minority government or coalition with the help of the SNP, Liberal Democrats, Greens or other minor parties. There was 'only a 42 per cent chance of a Conservative-led government, even though there is a two-thirds chance of the Tories being the largest party, on votes or seats.' He added: 'The single most likely outcome is\u2026a seriously hung parliament with the Conservatives as clearly the largest party but a majority on the left, including the SNP and Liberal Democrats.' David Cameron answers questions from 02 employees  in Leeds this afternoon ahead tonight's 'Challengers' television debate . Labour leader Ed Miliband addresses supporters during a visit to Crouch End  in north London this morning . This would be a 'messy and unstable situation' and it was 'not clear that this diverse group of parties would be able to sustain a stable government'. The Conservatives would probably turn to the DUP first and then the Lib Dems to try and form a government but they were still likely to be short of a majority, he added. The SNP's surge in Scotland was likely to be hugely damaging for Labour but Ed Miliband could still walk into Number 10 propped up by an alliance of left-leaning parties. A massive landslide to the SNP was inevitable, with the party winning at worst six times more seats than it currently holds or at best nine times more. Labour's disastrous performance in the Scottish polls could mean the party only has one safe seat: the Glasgow seat of Willie Bain. John Curtice, professor of politics at Strathclyde University, said the SNP vote surge was nothing new. Some 45 per cent of Scots had voted for the SNP in the 2011 Scottish parliamentary elections, 45 per cent voted in favour of independence during last year's Scottish referendum and the polls were now showing 45 per cent supported the SNP. But for the first time Scottish voters were voting the same way at a Westminster election as they would for the Scottish parliament.",

The famous Tiger Temple just outside of Bangkok, popular with tourists for being able to interact with the big cats, has been forced to shut due to keeping the animals without permits. Wat Pa Luangta Bua Yanasampanno has been told that their 147 tigers must be handed over to the Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation by Friday or they will be seized. The news will no doubt please animal rights activists who have been\u00a0campaigning\u00a0against the mistreatment of the\u00a0big cats at the sanctuary. End of Tiger Temple! The temple, just outside of Bangkok, has been told all animals must be handed over by Friday as the monks do not have permits for them . The Bangkok Post reported that the National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation's Department Chief, Nipon Chotiban, had issued the closure following a raid in February. The investigation was launched following\u00a0multiple\u00a0complaints of trafficking endangered species, illegally selling animals and possible mistreatment of the animals. Although the results of the raid have not revealed to the public, the chief has said the temple did not have permits for the cats. Chotiban says that the tigers are to be moved to the Khao Pra Thap Chang Wildlife Breeding Centre in Chom Bung district and Khao Son Wildlife Breeding Centre in Suan Phung district in Ratchaburi province. Animal rights activists have been complaining against the treatment of the tigers for years . The carnivores at the temple are hand-raised from an early age by monks in an attempt to control their aggressive behaviour . Having a picture with tigers is a popular tourist attraction at the\u00a0Kanchanaburi \u00a0sanctuary . Thai Visa News reported the Wildlife Conservation Office director, Tuanjai Nujdamrong, said: 'As Wat Pa Luang Ta Bua does not have proper cages and clear animal nurturing facilities, we can see that the temple has no intention to open as a public zoo. 'Therefore, they did not receive a reply when they sought a licence extension from the department and their [former] licence is no longer valid.'

        "article": "Lewis Hamilton dominated qualifying for the Bahrain Grand Prix \u2013 taking pole position under the lights at Sakhir by four-tenths of a second from Sebastian Vettel of Ferrari. Hamilton\u2019s Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg, who took pole here in the previous two years, was third six-tenths of a second behind Hamilton, a disappointment for the German on a track where he had hoped to rekindle his championship fight. The truth is that nobody can live with Hamilton at the moment. He has got pole in every race this season and been impressively quick in each race. Lewis Hamilton waves after qualifying on pole position for the Bahrain Grand Prix on Saturday and is flanked by Sebastian Vettel (left) and team-mate Nico Rosberg who qualified second and third respectivley . Hamilton made it four poles out of four this season under the lights at the\u00a0Sakhir circuit . Rosberg shook Hamilton\u2019s hand afterwards but kept his helmet on for longer than usual at the end of the session, no doubt contemplating how a Ferrari got between Hamilton and him. The last few minutes were dramatic. First Vettel set the fastest time, Rosberg failed to match it, before Hamilton swept to the front commandingly. The double world champion\u2019s smile was broad as he posed for pictures after taking his first pole in Bahrain. Rosberg was disconsolate. Qualifying proved that Ferrari are now in the championship fight, changing the dynamic for Hamilton and particularly Rosberg. Yes, it was pleasantly warm here but not sweltering hot, proving that Ferrari are not only fast in high temperatures. Hamilton in action during Saturday's qualifying session in Bahrain as he takes pole again . Jenson Button\u2019s misery continued. His McLaren broke down with him having done just one sector of one lap. His car was pushed away and he walked back through the paddock. He will start 20th and last \u2013 no place to start his 100th race for the team. \u2018It was a power cut,\u2019 said Button. \u2018I don't know where it came from. It's a shame because after practice we thought the car was doing pretty well.\u2019 Back in the garage Ron Dennis, the McLaren chairman, shrugged his hands in disappointment. There was a twist of embarrassment to his reaction, too, given that the team\u2019s biggest shareholders are the Bahraini royal family.

Jannik Andersen, a student at the University of Colorado, was hit by the train in the 45000 block of Pacific Street in Indio, four miles north-east of Coachella's grounds, shortly after 3am on Saturday. He was pronounced dead less than 40 minutes later. Police have launched an investigation into the incident. It remains unclear why Andersen was on the train tracks instead of at the music festival. Tragic: Jannik Andersen (pictured), an attendee at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival was struck and killed by a freight train just a few miles away from the event's California site, police said on Monday . Farewell: On Monday night, Mac DeMarco, a performer at the festival, took to Twitter to pay his respects to the fan, who was struck by a Union Pacific train. He told his 78,000 followers: 'RIP Jannik Andersen' Speaking to the Daily Camera, \u00a0Sergeant Deborah Gray, of Riverside coroner's office said it was too early to determine whether alcohol or drugs were involved in the Boulder student's tragic death. On Monday, friends were paying tribute to Andersen, who was  a non-degree seeking Continuing Education student from San Diego. They described him as a 'genuine' and always 'happy' man. Zac Hoffman, who also attends the university in Boulder, told the news site that the student was the 'happiest dude in the world', while\u00a0Cody Cooper said he was 'the most genuine and energetic' friend. Cooper added that Andersen had previously attended Coachella, and was especially excited to be joining the tens of thousands of people watching AC/DC and Mac DeMarco at this year's event. 'He had the wildest and strangest taste in music, but they were always great tunes,' he said. Festival: Andersen, a student at the University of Colorado, was hit by the train on tracks in Indio, four miles northeast of Coachella's grounds, shortly after 3am on Saturday. Above, crowds at the festival on Sunday . Use that big smile to guide others': Twitter user Jackson Moore posted a photo of Andersen beaming and drinking soda in the snow to the social network, writing: 'Only met a couple times but u were full of love' Friend: A young man named Ryan Douglas, who appears to have been one of Andersen's friends, also took to the site to express his sadness at the college student's death. He thanked others for reaching out to him . Flying over: Douglas is among many of Andersen's friends to be flying to San Diego for his funeral this week . On Monday night, Canadian singer Mac DeMarco himself took to Twitter to pay his respects to the fan, who was struck by a Union Pacific train. He told his 78,000 followers: 'RIP Jannik Andersen'. At around the same time, Twitter user Jackson Moore posted a photo of Andersen beaming and drinking soda in the snow to the site, writing: 'Only met a couple times but u were full of love. He added: 'Use that big smile to guide those you left behind.' Andersen's many friends, who live as far away as Australia and Britain, are said to be planning to fly to San Diego for a funeral for the student, who graduated from Torrey Pines High School in 2009. Scene: The Riverside coroner's office said it was too early to determine whether alcohol or drugs were involved in Andersen's death. Above, the 45000 block of Pacific Street, near where the crash occurred . The service is expected to be held near Andersen's home later this week.

        "article": "A mother was removed from a train and taken away in a police van because she took home a clothes horse she had found 'abandoned' in a carriage. Aimee Craven, of Hull, East Yorkshire, had claimed the Tesco product worth \u00a320 and taken it home after spotting it on a train the previous week - because she thought it had been left by its owner. But British Transport Police officers trawled through CCTV footage to track down the 32-year-old care worker before taking her off a train as she travelled to work in Brough. Police investigation: Mother-of-one Aimee Craven, of Hull, East Yorkshire, was accused of trying to shield the \u00a320 Tesco clothes horse from CCTV as she walked off the train in Brough (above) with it . Miss Craven - who is now waiting to see if she will be charged, but has been told it is likely she will receive a caution for theft - said: \u2018I was the first person to get on the train and I spotted it. \u2018I know the right thing to do would have been to hand it in but I thought, \u201cI\u2019ll have it\u201d. It was a spur of the moment, stupid decision, which I am sorry for. \u2018But I don\u2019t think what I did justifies everything that then happened. The police got on the train, asked me to step off it and I had no idea what it was about. \u2018Everyone was looking at me. I was absolutely traumatised, it was awful. They asked me if I\u2019d taken it and I told them the truth. They said it was theft.\u2019 Police insisted to MailOnline that she was not arrested - and told how the victim was on the train at the time of the theft, and had placed the clothes horse behind her seat while travelling. After being taken off the train, Miss Craven was driven home in a police van and asked how long she had lived at her address and whether she owned the property. Facing a caution for theft: Miss Craven was asked by British Transport Police to go for questioning at their offices at Hull Paragon (above), where she was given a solicitor, paid for by legal aid . She was also said to have been asked where she worked, how long she had worked there, which shifts she did and what time she finished. Miss Craven was then made to take her wet clothes off the airer she had been using for a week, while police waited to confiscate the item. The mother-of-one, who cares for the elderly, was then allegedly asked to attend a police station for questioning where she had her DNA taken from a mouth swab and was fingerprinted. She said:\u00a0\u2018When I got home and went in and said the police are here for the clothes horse my boyfriend thought I was joking. \u2018He said, \u201cOh very funny, April Fools\u2019 was ages ago\u201d. Then when I started taking the clothes off he said, \u201cAimee I think you are going too far now\u201d. He just didn\u2019t believe me until he saw me giving it to the police.\u2019 The officers then asked Miss Craven to go back for questioning at their offices at Hull Paragon, where she was given a solicitor, paid for by legal aid. She was accused of trying to shield the item from CCTV as she walked off the train in Brough. Miss Craven, who has no convictions, said: \u2018They made me feel like I was Hull\u2019s most wanted. It really has been the worst experience of my life. With all the questions and them prying into my life I was petrified. \u2018My solicitor said even if you found something in a skip and took it you could be done for theft and so he advised me to admit theft to get a caution, otherwise it would go to court. \u2018The whole thing is ridiculous, it\u2019s cost a lot more than the price of the clothes horse. I\u2019d have happily bought her a new one. It\u2019s a complete waste of their time and taxpayers\u2019 money. \u2018I\u2019ve had to admit theft to get a caution, which I don\u2019t agree with and I\u2019ve now got a criminal record.\u2019 A British Transport Police spokesman told MailOnline: \u2018Following the alleged theft of a clothes horse from the 7.10am Hull to King's Cross service on April 9, a 32-year-old woman from Hull was interviewed after she voluntary attended Hull police station. 'The rightful owner of the clothes horse had placed it behind her seat and discovered it was missing when the train arrived at Brough station approximately 15 minutes later. She contacted police after seeing a woman walking along the platform carrying it. 'The woman was identified after officers reviewed CCTV from the station and undertook an anniversary visit. The item was recovered and has been returned to its owner. She has thanked officers for their actions. 'British Transport Police treats all reports of theft reported to us seriously, regardless of the item stolen, and will investigate every offence thoroughly.'",

        "article": "When Pele and Bobby Moore embraced, yielding perhaps the most famous of all images of sportsmanship on a football pitch, the final whistle had already blown. That was in 1970, at the end of a wonderfully hard-fought World Cup group match between England and Brazil, which the South Americans won 1-0. So loudly did the football world applaud such an exhibition of mutual respect between two giants of the game that all these decades later, the applause still resounds. That image of them is frequently flourished as a perfect example of what the game was, and is used to compare, unfavourably, with what it has become. Newcastle keeper Tim Krul  congratulated Sunderland striker Jermain Defoe on his goal at half-time . Bobby Moore's famous hug with Pele in 1970 is often held up as the peak of sportsmanship . And so the Stadium of Light on Sunday afternoon. Tim Krul and Jermain Defoe are lesser stars than Moore and Pele, of course, and the Newcastle United goalkeeper\u2019s instinctively friendly gesture towards the man who had just scored a brilliant goal past him took place with 45 minutes yet to play. But was it really so different to that celebrated business in Guadalajara, Mexico, for which we don\u2019t only continue to congratulate the England colossus and the Brazilian legend for their integrity and values, but also ourselves, somehow, for knowing and loving the game when it still had a place for common decency? Sportsmail\u2019s Jamie Carragher, among many others, has lambasted Krul for an inappropriate show of brotherhood towards a fellow professional. On Match of the Day 2, Danny Murphy agreed. The Dutchman, they say, was out of order. The implication is that, as he walked off the pitch at half-time, he should have been so lost in his own despair, or anger, or disappointment, or fierce resolve to get back on terms, that if he\u2019d noticed Defoe at all, the only acceptable form of communication should have been a muttered oath, or at best a hard stare. Krul smiles at Defoe shortly after the striker's goal gave the Black Cats the lead in the Wear-Tyne derby . Sportsmail's Jamie Carragher criticised Krul for his half-time actions while speaking on Sky Sports . Any form of friendliness could at the very least have waited until after the game was over, they reckon. Meanwhile, for some of Krul\u2019s critics on social media, the fact that it was an intense local derby puts his behaviour almost beyond the pale. How unutterably depressing. Has football really become so leeched of humanity that one decent pro can\u2019t turn to another and say \u2018well played\u2019? Nobody thinks that Krul would have complimented his opponent had it been a scuffed shot through his legs from two yards. But it was a wondrous strike, and, derby or not, half-time or not, a game that has no room either for an acknowledgment of a great piece of technique, or for a simple, impulsive act of sportsmanship, is a game that has become entirely detached from its roots. Defoe (left) hit a stunning volley on the cusp of half-time to give Sunderland the lead against Newcastle . Defoe celebrates his strike which helped the Black Cats to victory in the Wear-Tyne derby . Others insist otherwise, saying only someone with \u2018no passion\u2019 for football could commend Krul for doing what he did. That\u2019s rubbish. I am a passionate Evertonian and naturally I have asked myself how I\u2019d feel if, let\u2019s say, Tim Howard congratulated Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard in the tunnel after just being beaten by him, stupendously, from 30 yards. Would I consider it disrespectful to shell-shocked fans? Or assume that by so publicly fraternising with the \u2018enemy\u2019, Howard wasn\u2019t quite up for what remained of the fight? Of course not. On the contrary, I\u2019d be pleased to have a grown-up on my team. Moreover, there is another dimension to all this. The sub-text in at least some of the excoriation of Krul\u2019s back-slapping is that he is one of the Premier League\u2019s foreign imports, and either doesn\u2019t fully understand the ferocious tribalism that flavours the Tyne-Wear derby, or being a highly-paid mercenary, chooses not to inhale it. Newcastle came up short against their rivals yet again, but Krul's gesture was not the problem . Defoe's strike was a goal worthy of winning any game, and congratulating him was the decent thing to do . But that\u2019s rubbish, too. Some of us might have wistfully fond memories of an age when English football was overwhelmingly populated by players from the British Isles, but we kid ourselves if we think that the modern domestic game is divided by passports into those who give their all and those who don\u2019t. And yet, let\u2019s be brutally honest, would the condemnation have been quite so swift and quite so loud if the boot had been on the other foot on Sunday, if it had been Defoe walking down the tunnel at half-time slapping Krul on the back for denying him seconds earlier with a truly breathtaking, world-class save? In fact, would there have been any condemnation at all? Or would it have been held up as a heart-warming example, even in the intense heat of competition, of a typically honest English footballer doing the decent thing?",

However, others have defended Krul's actions, citing the importance of sportsmanship and the fact that Defoe's goal was a brilliant piece of technique that deserved recognition. The incident has sparked a debate about the role of sportsmanship in football and whether it is still valued in the modern game."

        "article": "Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola blamed his team's Champions League quarter-final first-leg defeat by Porto on injuries. Porto take a two-goal advantage to Munich next Tuesday for the return leg of the last-eight clash after punishing a sloppy Bayern with two early goals from Ricardo Quaresma and a second-half effort from Jackson Martinez. Guardiola said: 'We have players who were out a long time with injuries ... their legs don't last very long. It's a tough result to take into the second leg, but we'll give it a go.' Pep Guardiola says his side suffered with the injuries they are currently contending with in the squad . Porto manager Julen Lopetegui said his side can now dream of reaching the semi-finals, but they will need to be 'perfect' in the second leg. 'Now we have produced a situation for ourselves where we can dream, knowing that we will need to give everything we have got to get through,' Lopetegui, a former Barcelona team mate of Guardiola, told reporters. 'We will need to produce a perfect performance in Germany next week to progress.' Julen Lopetegui says reaching the Champions League semi-final would be a dream come true . Ricardo Quaresma (7) gave Porto an early lead from the spot but Manuel Neuer was lucky to be on the pitch . Lopetegui said the return from injury of goalscorer Martinez, who had been out since early March with a hamstring problem, was one of the reasons for Wednesday's victory. 'With him back in the attack, we were able to press Bayern with some force and give them real problems,' he said. Martinez, who capitalised on an error by Jerome Boateng in the 65th minute to round Bayern keeper Manuel Neuer for Porto's third goal after Thiago Alcantara had reduced the arrears, said he was not yet 100 percent fit. The striker was a constant menace for Bayern's defenders and his tenacious harrying was rewarded after three minutes when he robbed Xabi Alonso before being brought down by Neuer for a penalty that Quaresma converted. Jackson Martinez (right) rounds Neuer to slot home Porto's third goal and put them in control . Martinez troubled Bayern throughout and tackled Xabi Alonso (right) in the build up to the penalty . It was a similar story for Porto's second goal when Quaresma picked the pocket of Dante before beating Neuer with a clever finish on 10 minutes. 'It was fundamental that we tried our best to impose ourselves on Bayern and not give them a chance to settle,' Martinez said. Quaresma also sought to heap praise on Porto's team ethic, saying hard work had proved the difference between the two teams. 'There are no stars here. We all work hard for our results,' the forward said. 'The win is more important to us than the display. We have all worked extremely hard to get this win to give ourselves something to defend in the second leg.' Quaresma scores Porto's second inside 11 minutes as they took advantage of a depleted Bayern Munich .",

But there's a new superfood on the block, which is thought to\u00a0enhance your mood, renew skin and even help with menopause symptoms. Reaping with beauty and health benefits, experts say it's time to replace coconut oil with pumpkin seed oil, which is being touted as the the new must-have - and, of course, health aficionado Gwyneth Paltrow is already a fan. Health gurus are touting pumpkin seed oil as the next big thing - and say it can help enhance your mood, renew skin and even reduce menopause symptoms (just ask Gwyneth Paltrow, who features it in many of her recipes in her book, It's All Good) Much like coconut oil, pumpkin seed oil is thought to help boost shiny locks. Pumpkin seeds are rich in vitamins A, K and E, as well as vital minerals and fatty acids, which can help strengthen hair and even help boost hair growth. When applied to the lengths of your locks,\u00a0PowerHealth, who supply the health produce, say it  hydrates hair follicles giving shiny and lustrous strands. It also apparently has similar skin-boosting benefits. With high amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids and natural antioxidants, pumpkin seed oil helps promote normal cell structure and retains moisture, which ensures skin is hydrated and youthful. Zinc and vitamin E from the pumpkin seed can also improve the skin\u2019s healing process, helping to fight off acne, beat scarring and maintain skin renewal. Pumpkin seeds, left, are rich in vitamins A, K and E, as well as vital minerals and fatty acids, which can help, strengthen hair. The oil, right, can be drizzled onto food or applied directly to skin and hair to help boost your beauty and health . Studies have even found that pumpkin seeds are a mood-boosting food. Pumpkin seeds and chia seeds topped a top-ten list of mood-boosting foods compiled by dietitian Sarah Schenker and food psychologist Christy Fergusson. One of the richest sources of tryptophan, pumpkin seeds increase production of serotonin, a hormone that can help improve people\u2019s mood and help us feel relaxed. With a high zinc content, which plays a central role in boosting the immune system and cell division, pumpkin seeds can increase brain power by enhancing memory and focus, claim nutritionists. The potent seeds are also thought to help beat menopausal symptoms. The little seeds are said to be rich in natural phytoestrogens, which can decrease blood pressure, headaches, hot flushes, joint pain and other menopausal symptoms. Pumpkin seeds, pictured, topped a top-ten list of mood-boosting foods compiled by dietitian Sarah Schenker and food psychologist Christy Fergusson . Nutritional therapist Angela Falaschi told The Telegraph: 'Hot \ufb02ushes are one of the most common and distressing symptoms of the menopause, with extreme highs and lows in temperature causing episodes of profuse sweating. 'I often recommend supplementing the diet with iso\ufb02avonoids (naturally occurring compounds) by incorporating chick peas, soya, lentils and pumpkin seeds into your meals.' Gwyneth Paltrow, who penned cookbook It's All Good, loves to use the nutrient-rich seeds in her healthy recipes. Lorna Driver-Davies, Nutritionist at NutriCentre, said: 'Pumpkin seed oil is high in the polyunsaturated fatty acid (a longer chain fatty acid) omega 6, which is beneficial for the skin and hormone support in women. I also recommend pumpkin seed oil to men due to the zinc content. 'But we must be careful to not use too much omega 6 oils in our diet as we need less of them than we do omega 3. A source of omega 3 would be oily fish. When using any nutritional oils, we should all be aware that balance is key and use a wide variety of sources; coconut, pumpkin and fish, for example.'",

        "article": "All eyes were again on Jimmy Anderson as England on Thursday night began their push for victory here but instead the limelight was seized by Chris Jordan with his second stunning catch of the first Test. A day that featured a fourth Test century in only his ninth match for Gary Ballance ended with the leader of England\u2019s attack still waiting for the wicket that will bring him level with Sir Ian Botham\u2019s Test record. So well did Ballance and England bat that Alastair Cook was able to set West Indies a target of 438 in just over four sessions that would even surpass their own world record successful Test chase. Yet so solidly did West Indies begin their attempt to emerge unscathed from this first of three Tests that it became pertinent to remember that record was set in none other than Antigua and featured a century by a certain Shiv Chanderpaul. It remains highly unlikely that West Indies will today surpass the 418 for seven they made to defeat Australia at the old St John\u2019s Rec 12 years ago. Cook, though, will be grateful for the athleticism of Jordan and the off-spin of Joe Root for the wicket that means England remain firm favourites to secure today what would be a highly valuable victory for them. When West Indies grafted their way to 90 for one on this fourth day it was possible to believe that they would at least be able to escape with a draw from this match and head to Grenada next week still all square. Yet When Jordan dived to his right at wide slip and grasped the chance offered by Darren Bravo\u2019s flailing bat in Root\u2019s second over a second West Indian wicket had fallen and England ended the day with a spring in their step. They still have much to do and all results remain possible but England will be much the happier with West Indies finishing on 98 for two, still a massive 340 short of recreating Antiguan Test history. For Anderson, however, there was just more frustration as he could not strike a blow in the seven overs he has so far bowled in the second innings. Botham remains in the wings, with a nice bottle of red at the ready, to congratulate Anderson if and when the big moment comes today. England timed both the pace of their batting and their declaration to perfection, scoring quickly enough to set West Indies that world record breaking target and giving themselves 130 overs to bowl them out. And at the centre of their batting effort was Ballance who has made a start to his Test career that can genuinely be described as great. Darren Bravo nicks Joe Root's delivery as Chris Jordan gets ready to pounce . Bravo can only watch on as Jordan makes a stunning dive to seize the loose ball . Jordan shows tremendous reflexes to cling on to dismiss the West Indies batsman . Gary Ballance plays a shot during day four of England's first Test against West Indies on Thursday . Ballance plays a sweeping shot during his impressive innings at the\u00a0Sir Vivian Richards Stadium . Ballance celebrates bringing up his century following his superb batting display in Antigua . Joe Root formed a solid partnership with Ballance and made big inroads against the home side . Root salutes the stands after he brought up his half century earlier in the day . Jos Buttler also impressed for Peter Moores' side with an unbeaten 59 off 56 balls . It is extraordinary, really, that Ballance should have been perceived to be under any sort of pressure going into the second innings of this first Test. Yes, he had a poor World Cup after being thrown into the England team with little preparation ahead of their opening match against Australia. And, yes, Ballance looked tentative in the first innings here at the Sir Viv Richards Stadium, pushing at a ball with hard hands he could have left alone. Yet memories are short these days and it should be remembered that Ballance had an extraordinary summer last year having been asked to bat in a position at No 3 he was unaccustomed to by coach Peter Moores. This was the Ballance of last season, the white shirt seemingly a much better fit than the blue of limited-overs cricket, and he is quite simply a run machine in the ultimate form of the game. Root was furious with himself when he again got an inside edge to be bowled when a century was there for the taking but his partnership of 114 with Ballance came at a crucial time for England with West Indies still in the hunt. It says everything about Ballance\u2019s 122 that the only time he looked in trouble was when Jos Buttler hit Sulieman Benn straight back at him and struck his batting partner a nasty blow on the elbow. Other than that it was pretty much plain sailing for England, with Jos Buttler also returning to form with an unbeaten 59 off 56 balls. Stuart Broad (centre) celebrates with his England team-mates after taking the wicket of\u00a0Kraigg Brathwaite . Root (right) gets the plaudits from his team-mates after he took the wicket of Bravo late on day four . The openers, of course, are much more of an issue but a win here on Friday would buy Cook a bit of time for both him and Jonathan Trott to get things right in Grenada next week and Barbados in the final Test. With Anderson in the form that saw him take only two of the four wickets he needed at the start of this Test to surpass Botham\u2019s tally of 383 in the first innings it was left to Stuart Broad to strike the first blow for England. An absolute brute of a delivery saw Kraigg Braithwaite fending to short leg and Broad quickly pointing to the dressing room to salute the role that bowling coach Ottis Gibson, who knows West Indies inside out having been their coach until earlier this year, played in the dismissal. James Anderson unsuccessfully appeals for the wicket of Bravo earlier in the contest . He is one of the best slip fielders England have found in years but Jordan will be annoyed he could not pouch another chance offered by Devon Smith before the close. Smith lived to fight another day on 59 and he too was in West Indies\u2019 side that famous day in 2003 when history was made. If he is part of history again then it will have been an extraordinary last day. Any hopes of a West Indies collapse quickly faded and all was quiet until Jordan\u2019s intervention to replicate his similar diving effort in the first innings. The West Indies side await a decision from the third empire on the fourth day of action in the Caribbean . He is clearly one of the best slip fielders England have found in years but Jordan will be annoyed that he could not get a hand to another sharp chance offered by Devon Smith off Root before the close. Smith lives to fight another day on 59 and it should be pointed out that he too was in West Indies side that famous day in 2003 when history was made on this island. If he is part of history again then it really will have been an extraordinary last day.",

A courageous shopkeeper was killed when he made a desperate attempt to stop a gang of thieves who had broken into his van in a cash and carry car park. Prasanna \u2018Nick\u2019 Arulchelvam ran and jumped through an open side door of their van, but was pushed out and hit the ground as the vehicle sped away. A customer in the Costco car park in Watford where the incident happened reported hearing a \u2018nasty crunch\u2019 as the 34-year-old\u2019s head hit the ground. Today, the man who pushed Mr Prasanna to his death was jailed for 11 years after admitting all he wanted was \u2018a few cheap packets of cigarettes\u2019. Mr Prasanna had just finished his purchases when he returned to his silver Transit van and loaded a large box containing 21 smaller boxes of cigarettes in his van. He took his trolley back to a bay and returned to see that the stock he had bought had been disturbed, Luton Crown Court heard. Mr Prasanna then gave chase as he saw a separate van speeding off. Prosecutor John Price QC said: \u2018Mr Prasanna courageously acted in an attempt to stop the driver getting away. \u2018With equal determination and with an utterly callous regard for his safety, the two men used violence that cost this man his life. \u2018Mr Prasanna was forced out but managed to hold onto the side of the vehicle before the door was shut and he fell to the ground.\u2019 A witness said it was as if he had been pushed or kicked away from the van. Nothing had been taken from Mr Prasanna\u2019s van. Last October cousins Patrick and James O\u2019Driscoll were handed jail terms of ten-and-a-half years and seven-and-a-half years after pleading guilty to the manslaughter of Mr Prasanna. The sentence of Patrick O\u2019Driscoll, who was driving the van, was later increased to 12 years on appeal. His cousin was in another vehicle at the scene while a third man, Michael McInerney, 34, was in the rear of the van Mr Prasanna chased. McInerney went on the run after he was arrested in December 2013 and bailed. A European Arrest Warrant was issued but he was arrested in Corby, Northamptonshire in December 2014. Today he was jailed for a total of 11 years - ten-and-a-half years for manslaughter, two years concurrent for conspiracy to steal, with six months consecutive from the suspended sentence. Defence barrister Henry Hughes said the father of three accepts responsibility for the death of a man who deserved no harm at all. Jailed: Michael McInerney was handed an 11 year sentence after admitting to pushing Mr\u00a0Prasanna . \u2018He will live with the horror of the consequences of his actions for the rest of his life. He wanted no more than a few cheap packets of cigarettes,\u2019 he said. Judge Michael Kay QC told McInerney: \u2018Mr Prasanna was a hard working man and a family man with a wife and two-and-a-half-year-old son. He is described as a devoted and very loving father and husband. \u2018I can\u2019t help but compare Mr Prasanna who was a hard-working and lawful citizen with you. What example are you setting to your three children? \u201c . \u2018You applied violence to get Mr Prasanna off the vehicle. You pushed him out of the vehicle which began the chain of events that led to his death.\u2019 McInerney, from Borehamwood, Hertforshire, who was living at the time in Radwell, Bedforshire, appeared via a video link from Woodhill Prison, Milton Keynes. At an earlier hearing he pleaded not guilty to murder and not guilty to conspiracy to rob. His pleas of guilty to alternative charges of manslaughter and conspiracy to steal were accepted by the prosecution. He had 17 convictions for 32 offences and operated with alias names and false dates of birth. At the time Mr Prasanna was attacked, McInerney was serving a seven month suspended sentence suspended for 15 months for a similar theft from a motor vehicle at a cash and carry in Sheerness, in which a man who tried to stop him fell into the road. The day before Mr Prasanna was killed, the two O\u2019Driscolls had carried out thefts and attempted thefts at Booker cash and carry stores in Dagenham, Chelmsford, Colchester and Ipswich. On the Sunday they drove to Radwell and collected McInerney. The Costco in Watford where three men - cousins Patrick and James O\u2019Driscoll and\u00a0Michael McInerney - tried to grab cigarettes from Mr\u00a0Prasanna's van before speeding off in separate vehicles. All have now been jailed . In two vans they went to three sites, where they stole or attempted to steal from customers at Bookers in Bedford and Luton and at PC World at the Staples Retail Park in Hendon, before going to Costco in Watford. Mr Prasanna died on June 6 2013 in St Mary\u2019s Hospital in London, 11 days after the attack on him. He came to England from Sri Lanka in 1998 and worked for Tesco as a manager. Mr Prasanna later opened his own shop in Basingstoke, Hampshire, with his younger brother Uday. They opened another store in Sittingbourne, Kent, and were looking at starting a third Southampton. Four years ago he married Shayanthy, 30, and the couple lived in Grandfield Avenue, Watford with their young son.",

        "article": "(CNN)It's the simplest possible assignment, but it always teaches a huge lesson. Every year, Denver teacher Kyle Schwartz passes out Post-it notes to her third grade students and asks them to complete the sentence, \"I wish my teacher knew ...\" Many of the students she teaches at Doull Elementary just wish they had something in common with her, that she knew soccer or video games. But sometimes, their wishes bring tears to her eyes, and offer a glimpse of painful struggles in their young lives. There's a student who misses her father: \"I haven't seen him in six years.\" Another who wants to tell her she's lonely: \"I don't have friend to play with me.\" Still another who wants to explain why her reading log goes unsigned: \"My mom is not around a lot.\" And other who has big hopes for the future: \"I want to go to college.\" The assignment sprang from the kinds of conversations teachers have all the time, Schwartz said: \"What do our students need? How can we best serve them?\" Schwartz always gives her students the option to write their names on their notes or remain anonymous; of sharing them only with her, or with the entire class. It surprises her how often students stand up and want to read their wishes out loud, like the shy student who shared, \"I wish my teacher knew I'm nervous all the time.\" \"They feel respected, they feel safe enough to share some of these more sensitive ones,\" said Schwartz, who has been teaching for three years. \"Kids can share what they feel comfortable with.\" Recently, Schwartz began to post some students' responses on Twitter using the hashtag #IWishMyTeacherKnew. It spread, as teachers around the country tried it with their own classrooms. They sometimes reveal what kids are most worried about right now, like the child whose mother was sick, or another who had just experienced bullying. One student just wants more attention from the teacher. Sometimes, they have a little fun: \"I wish my teacher knew how to do a backflip.\" Occasionally, students want to reassure their teachers that that they're doing a great job. There's a lot for teachers to learn, too: \"They are KIDS who deal with a lot as they grow up,\" one educator posted on Twitter. Schwartz said she's learned not to assume what her students wish. Although most of the students at her school live in poverty, not every message is about a material need. There's no pressure to share something they're not ready to talk about, she said, and \"they're acutely aware of their own needs.\" Through assignments like this, she is, too. As her idea spread, many Twitter users asked how they can help to support her students. She's pointed them toward a DonorsChoose.org fund where she posts a classroom project wish list. So far, most have been fulfilled.",

        "article": "Marylin Stoneman, pictured leaving court, stole more than \u00a322,000 from her vulnerable victim to fund her gambling addiction . A gambling addict stole more than \u00a322,000 from her grandmother's 98-year-old partner to blow on her scratchcard habit, a court heard. Marylin Stoneman had been entrusted with the vulnerable victim's pin number,\u00a0cheque books and bank cards to manage his financial affairs after he went into\u00a0care at Cedar House, Rothley. But the court heard that she abused that trust and began withdrawing up to \u00a3200 a day to feed her gambling habit. The 64-year-old admitted stealing \u00a322,650 from the elderly victim but was ordered to pay back just \u00a31,350 - which was all that remained of the stolen funds. The theft was  discovered after the deputy manager of the care home became suspicious that Stoneman's step-grandfather, Douglas Woodrow, was receiving a number of letters from the bank. On August 19, he asked a member of staff to open one of the letters which indicated the victim had no money left in his accounts. The care home alerted Lloyds Bank in Loughborough, where they noticed unauthorised cash\u00a0withdrawals had taken place from July 2013 and the police were contacted. Leicester Crown Court heard that Stoneman was 'solely responsible' and 'had been waiting for\u00a0the police.' She had also taken an overdose as a result, the court heard. The devastated victim, who had gone into the care home in Leicestershire after a number of falls, said he felt angry and betrayed by Stoneman. In a statement read to the court, Mr Woodrow said:\u00a0'She has stole money from my bank account which is my life savings. It is what I have paid for my care. 'I am so angry she has taken everything. I am angry at everyone. It has\u00a0really hurt me. 'I have worked hard all my life to be left with nothing.\u00a0'I can't trust anyone.' Defending Stoneman, who has no previous convictions, Vasanti Vaitha said:\u00a0'It was a relief when the police knocked on the door. She had been waiting\u00a0for it for a long time. 'She does take full responsibility - and realises the impact it has had on\u00a0the family. Stoneman had been entrusted with the vulnerable victim's financial affairs after he went into care at Cedar House, Rothley . 'This offence occurred from a gambling addiction while she was looking\u00a0after the victim's finances. Her gambling spiralled out of control. 'She tried to take her own life.' Judge Michael Fowler said: 'I know you understand the meanness and\u00a0seriousness of what you have done. 'It is more serious that Mr Woodrow trusted you. And the fact the funds you\u00a0took were funds he had accumulated over his life and depended on them to\u00a0some extent to pay for his care home fees. 'I can't ignore the fact that addictions do exist and there is no other\u00a0motivation.' She was handed a suspended sentence of two years with 200 hours of unpaid\u00a0work and be part of a supervision requirement for 18 months. The judge also stated that \u00a31,350 would be confiscated for compensation and any sums recovered in the future should be paid to Mr Woodrow.

Days later, the one-year-old bully breed mix showed up sickly and covered in dirt at a nearby farm. Now, the dog that defied death is recovering with the help of good Samaritans and veterinarians at Washington State University. Scroll down for video . Survivor: Ryann Simmons sits with the dog his girlfriend is fostering at their home in Moses Lake, Wash. The dog, Theia, survived being run over, beaten with a hammer and buried, and now needs surgery . Heroic: Theia, a 1-year-old bully breed mix was hit by a car and then struck in the head with a hammer and buried, but she managed to dig herself out . Hanging on: A driver hit the dog with a car -- and that person proceeded to strike the dog. The dog appeared to be hit with hammer in a mercy killing. The dog used to roam the streets getting scraps of food from people in Moses Lake, a farm town about 100 miles west of Spokane. About a month ago, she was struck by a car. Then things got worse: Someone cracked her in the head with a hammer and placed her in a box in a farm field. But the dog somehow survived and was discovered at a nearby farm with a dislocated jaw, leg injuries and a caved-in sinus cavity. The wounds helped veterinarians piece together what happened, including the hammer blow. 'I'm assuming that the person who did this meant to put her out of her misery,' said Sara Mellado, who learned about the dog's plight on Facebook and took the animal into her Moses Lake home. She named the dog Theia. Recover: Theia is scheduled to go into surgery in a few weeks time after raising money through crowdfunding . New lease of life: Theia, who truly rose from the grave, rarely stops wagging her tail . Back on all fours! Theia's injuries include a dislocated jaw and multiple bone fractures around her nasal cavity, which makes it difficult for her to eat and breathe but it looks as though she is truly on the mend . 'Considering everything that she's been through, she's incredibly gentle and loving,' Mellado told The Associated Press. 'She's a true miracle dog, and she deserves a good life.' Theia is receiving care at WSU's Veterinary Teaching Hospital in Pullman. A CT scan of her skull revealed a condition that constricts the nasal passages, restricting air flow into the lungs, said veterinary resident Andrea Sundholm, who's assisting with Theia's treatment. It was caused by multiple nasal bone fractures. When Theia tries to draw air in through her nose, she's forced to open her mouth to breathe instead. But with a dislocated jaw, that is challenging as well. Theia's jaw is healing on its own, but the nasal-bone fractures have caused lasting problems, Sundholm said. Fixing that will require surgery to insert a stent, she said. Help out: Mellado has raised more than $12,000 towards the dog's surgery using the crowdfunding website GoFundMe. So far, contributions have come from Moses Lake, Washington State University and elsewhere . Ouch! X-rays of Theia's skull show the damage that was caused by everything she went through . The veterinary hospital's Good Samaritan Fund awarded $700 to help pay for Theia's early treatment. Mellado has raised another $10,000 for the surgery through a crowdfunding website, and is planning to call WSU to schedule the procedure. The university said despite her injuries, Theia is friendly and likes to kiss people's cheeks. Mellado said she has been deluged with calls from people seeking to help. Theia is staying with Mellado's family until they find her a permanent home. 'She's a puppy,' Mellado said. 'She's outgoing, lovable, up for meeting new people.'",

Labour candidate Paul Gilbert mocked Ed Miliband and then joked that he hoped his 'off-piste' comment would not 'find it's way back' to the Labour leadership .

Now I am a Labour man and I will stand by my party, thick and thin. 'It's a bit like having a manager of a football team that you don't rate, but you still support the team, sometimes. 'What we have to do is work out how we can make the difference best, and from my point of view you're better on the inside making a difference than being on the outside grumbling about it.' To laughter from the audience, he was mocked by one of his fellow candidates for his 'glowing endorsement' for Labour's leader. Ed Miliband, pictured giving a speech in Stockton-on-Tees today, has promised to cut tuition fees from up to \u00a39,000 to \u00a36,000 if he is elected on May 7 . Ed Miliband has revealed his childhood dream was to become a London bus conductor. The Labour leader said a fascination with the ticket machines on the old-style vehicles had made him want the job. Mr Miliband made the admission during a visit to Stockton-on-Tees, where he was asked by a young boy in the audience, Nelson Driscoll, what he wanted to be when he was seven years old. He replied: 'I wanted to be a bus conductor. I tell you why, because on the London buses there used to be these things where you used to turn around the ticket machine. I was particularly fascinated by that.' Mr Miliband is not the only party leader to have dreamed of being on the buses. Conservative former prime minister Sir John Major once failed a test to become a bus conductor. The seat of Cheltenham is held by the Lib Dem Martin Horwood, who secured a majority of 4,920 over the Conservatives in 2010. But the constituency is seen as crucial to Tory hopes of winning an overall majority in the Commons. However, five years ago Labour secured just 5 per cent of the vote. Mr Miliband has promised to cut tuition fees from up to \u00a39,000 to \u00a36,000 if he is elected on May 7. Critics have argued the only people to benefit from the reductions will be wealthy graduates, because most people would never pay back the full amount during their working lifetime. But Mr Gilbert appeared to suggest the party should have gone further in reducing the cost of gaining a degree. He said: 'You know that in the Labour manifesto the fees will come down to \u00a36,000 - it still feels entirely unsatisfactory.' He added: 'But it seems to me with two daughters who are 22 and 20, and they have been saddled with debt as the gentleman in the audience mentioned earlier. 'I find it really silly and really ridiculous that we have not worked this one through sufficiently well. 'We have choices. We have choices for all sorts of things, but we choose to spend the money on other things, and I wish we didn't, I wish we really didn't.' He finished his criticism of his party by adding: 'I don't like where we are, I wish it was different, but I hope we can see it differently going forward.'",

        "article": "Freddie Gray should have received medical attention at the spot where he was arrested - before he was put inside a police van, authorities said Friday. Baltimore police have come under intense scrutiny after Gray was taken into custody and suffered an unexplained spinal injury that led to his death. Six officers have been suspended with pay as local police and federal authorities investigate. However, commissioner Anthony Batts has ruled out the possibility of his resignation. Scroll down for video . 'That's not going to happen': Baltimore police commissioner Anthony Batts ruled out his resignation despite that fact that his deputy admitted they should have sought medical attention for Freddie Gray . Batts addressed a news conference in Baltimore on Friday amid growing calls for him to step down . Concession: Police admit they should have sought medical help for Freddie Gray (pictured being detained on April 12) when he requested assistance in the police car. He was later pronounced dead . Commissioner Batts said the investigation is being refined and the picture is getting 'sharper and sharper.' He did not elaborate. As for calls for his resignation, he said: 'That's not going to happen.' Gray, who is black, was arrested April 12 after he made eye contact with officers and ran away, police said. Officers held him down, handcuffed him and loaded him into a police van. While inside, he became irate and leg cuffs were put on him, police have said. Gray died on Sunday, April 19, after he 'had his spine 80 per cent severed at his neck' while in police custody . Gray was not buckled in by a seat belt, a violation of the police department's policy. He asked for medical help several times, and after a 30-minute ride that included three stops, paramedics were called. At some point - either during his arrest or inside the van - he suffered a mysterious spinal injury. Authorities have not explained how or when it occurred. Deputy police commissioner Kevin Davis said Friday that Gray should have received medical attention at the spot of his arrest. Bystander video shows Gray screaming as officers carried him to the van, his legs appearing limp. After a week of protests, people angry over the death promised their biggest march Saturday, when they would try to 'shut down' the city. The demonstrators say Gray's death shows police mistreatment of blacks in Baltimore and throughout the country. The mayor thanked protesters for being peaceful so far. She expects the results of the investigation to be turned over to prosecutors in a week, and they will decide whether any criminal charges will be filed. 'I will not deny we have had a very long and complicated history on issues such as these,' Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake said. 'But it's important to remember that we have an equally long history of peaceful and legal protest.' Asked if Gray's possible 'rough ride' is a one-off, the mayor said: 'It's clearly not a one-off. The reason we have the policy around seat belts in the police vans is because of an incident that happened previously,' referring to Dondi Johnson. He died of a fractured spine in 2005 after he was arrested for urinating in public and transported without a seat belt, with his hands cuffed behind his back. Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake speaks in front of local faith leaders at a news conference regarding the death of Freddie Gray on Friday. She appeared to support the police with her statements . Captain Erik Pecha of the Baltimore Police Department exchanges words with young demonstrators . More than 50 officers manned a barricade surrounding the station, separating them from the protesters . Protesters for Freddie Gray stand outside the Baltimore Police Department's Western District police station. The protest was peaceful, though some in the crowd hurled insults at the officers behind the fence, who stared back stone-faced . Angela Hazel (C) reacts near City Hall during a protest against the death of Freddie Gray Hazel said 'I lost my child to the streets, too. My only child...' The leader of a group of local ministers called on Batts to resign immediately. 'It seems that no one in the police department can explain what happened,' said the Rev. Alvin Gwynn Sr., president of the Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance of Baltimore. He said the police department is 'in disarray' and Batts has shown a 'lack of viable leadership capabilities.' The mayor appeared to back the police commissioner at her own news conference. 'Nickel rides' have caused spinal injuries in the past and Baltimore police epartment rules were updated nine days before Gray's arrest stating that all detainees shall be strapped in by seat belts or other device . The president of a black lawyers' group predicted thousands of people would turn out Saturday, when good weather is forecast and the Orioles are hosting the Boston Red Sox in a Major League Baseball game. 'Things will change on Saturday, and the struggle will be amplified,' said Malik Shabazz of Black Lawyers for Justice. Shabazz rejected the notion that he was an outside agitator who would stir up trouble. Bernard Young, Baltimore City Council president said prior to a rally on Thursday that he hoped citizens wouldn't let 'outside forces come in here and dictate how we act by destroying our infrastructure.' 'We can lead ourselves. We're capable of doing that,' he said.",

        "article": "Most people might believe that being covered in face tattoos would make it impossible to land a job; but for one inked-up Canadian man the decision to cover his head, neck and arms in crude body art has actually earned him a lucrative career as a model. Vin Los, 24, gained notoriety last year\u00a0for his tattoo-covered visage and his dreams of becoming the most famous man in the world; despite facing heavy criticism about his unique ink, Vin insisted that the Sharpie-like tattoos on his face, neck, chest, and arms 'embody pop culture', create 'a myth, a mystery' and would one day help him to achieve his goal of global fame. And while many may have doubted his chances of succeeding, it seems his unique look has actually started to pay off, as the Montreal-based model has landed a campaign for underwear brand Gar\u00e7on Model. Scroll down for video . Inked in his underwear: Vin Loss, 24, stars in a new campaign for underwear brand\u00a0Gar\u00e7on Model that showcases his extensive body art . Baring it all: Modeling underwear allows Vin to show off his many tattoos, which include the names of cities like Baghdad, San Francisco, New York, and Kuala Luampur . The ads, which feature Vin posing in boxer briefs, put his tattoos on full display, spotlighting phrases like\u00a0'scream my name', 'iconic face', and 'my man is str8', as well as tattooed-on chest hair. 'You could look at me in a hundred years from now and really get the idea of what pop culture was like in the early 2010s,' he told\u00a0Vice\u00a0last year, adding that the words and phrases he chooses are inspired by YouTube songs, places, and other 'superficial' things. 'I want to be an image for people to look at, something that has an impact,' he says. 'Everybody who sees me is bound to ask questions: \u201cWhy fame? What\u2019s his life like?\u201d' Art history: Vin says he got his first tattoo around the age of 16; it's the logo for Le Coq Sportif on his chest . Flashing his fame: One of his most prominent tattoos, the word 'fame' written across his forehead summarizes Vin's biggest goal . Vin's extensive body art has taken him years to cultivate \u2014 while he now has 24 tattoos on his face and others on his arms, neck, chest, legs, and stomach, he started with a single rendering of the Le Coq Sportif logo when he was 16. He also insists that his tattoos are real, and has gone so far as to prove the designs are permanent by filming himself washing up, in order to show that the ink doesn\u2019t come off when scrubbed. 'If I was indecisive, I don\u2019t think I would write on my face,' he explains. Don't forget this face: Vin likes that his many tattoos make him memorable and thinks they make him a 'myth' and a 'mystery' Adding them up: Vin has 24 tattoos on his face alone, including the words 'guilty', 'play', and 'famous' Before breaking into modeling, Vin worked at a supermarket where he says he 'wanted to die'; now he hopes to build an empire and bring a paparazzi culture to his hometown of Montreal because he is disappointed that the city doesn't have a 'star system'. He also designs\u00a0wallets, which he sells for $98 on his newly-launched website. Vin is not the first heavily-tattooed model to use his body art to earn modelling gigs; photographer Christian Saint recently released a book called Tattoo Super Models that features women covered in ink.",

        "article": "Manchester United had four different scorers On Sunday. At the start of the season I don\u2019t think anyone would have thought that quartet would be anywhere near the team, let alone scoring vital goals in a huge Manchester derby. With all that money flashing around you would have picked Angel di Maria over Juan Mata, Marcus Rojo over Chris Smalling and just about anybody over Marouane Fellaini and Ashley Young. But all four have proved their worth. People said Mata was too slow but his brain is certainly quick enough. Fellaini is now United\u2019s go-to guy and Smalling has improved. Juan Mata celebrates after scoring against Manchester City, and he is part of Louis van Gaal's 'fab four' Ashley Young is another player that few would have expected to be a key part of Van Gaal's plans . Marouane Fellaini has become Manchester United's go-to player in midfielder this season . Chris\u00a0Smalling has improved and despite the summer spending he remains a key aprt of the team . As for Young, who would have thought he would become one of United\u2019s most consistent players? It just shows how Louis van Gaal works. He doesn\u2019t care about names \u2014 he wants to pick the right person at the right time and give everyone a chance. The only potential problem would be a Michael Carrick injury. He has been instrumental in United\u2019s revival. As for Manuel Pellegrini, I feel for him because he seems a good guy but this could be the final straw. Van Gaal\u00a0doesn\u2019t care about names \u2014 he wants to pick the right person at the right time and give  a chance . The only potential problem would be a Michael Carrick injury as he has been instrumental in United\u2019s revival . ADDING GOALS WILL MAKE JAMES A STAR . We've heard a lot about James Ward-Prowse and he was one of my 10 players to watch at the start of the season. He is a fantastic young player with fine technique and an excellent set-piece. But it\u2019s incredible that the penalty he scored on Saturday was only his second goal in 85 games for Southampton. He grew up idolising David Beckham and Steven Gerrard but they did not just provide, they scored too. James Ward-Prowse was one of my 10 players to watch at the start of the season and he scored this weekend . Now he has to go up a level and try and emulate his heroes by scoring goals on a regular basis. If he does that, he could well be one of the young England stars fighting for a midfield place at Euro 2016. Ward-Prowse\u00a0grew up idolising David Beckham (right) and Steven Gerrard (centre), he must score like them . My tip for Ward-Prowse from August 2014 as one of my 10 players to watch this season . 1998 - The last time all three promoted teams were relegated the following season was in 1997-98. RELEGATION RIVALS . With Leicester\u2019s last-minute win and QPR unlucky to lose against Chelsea, it\u2019s all becoming very tight at the bottom. The three promoted teams are all in the relegation zone as it stands but I\u2019ve got a sneaky feeling one of them will get out of it. And here\u2019s a good omen for them. Only once before in Premier League history have all three promoted teams gone straight back down and that happened 17 seasons ago. The race is on. QPR were unlucky to lose against Chelsea\u00a0but I\u2019ve got a feeling one of the promoted teams will survive . LENNON LOOKING HAPPY AGAIN . When Aaron Lennon went on loan to Everton, his first photo shoot caused quite a stir. There was barely a hint of a smile and plenty of people wondered if he really wanted to be there. Now he looks like he\u2019s loving life under Roberto Martinez. He is a good player, has scored a few goals and suits how Martinez wants to play. I would not be surprised if he made the switch permanent. Aaron Lennon\u00a0looks like he\u2019s loving life under Roberto Martinez and he suits the way the manager plays . CRESSWELL'S CURLER . Aaron Cresswell\u2019s free-kick was one of the finest set-piece goals we\u2019ve seen all season. It feels like a lot of free-kicks have gone flying in this campaign and I wondered if the referee\u2019s vanishing spray was having a big impact. But even with the spray, which is a good addition, there hasn\u2019t been a big change in terms of successful free-kicks, as our table shows. Aaron Cresswell\u2019s free-kick against Stoke City was one of the finest set-piece goals we\u2019ve seen all season . Cresswell's was good but there hasn\u2019t been a big change in  successful free-kicks, as our table shows . 4 -\u00a0In 29 games this season, Bolasie has four goals. In his last 77 Palace games he only scored three. BOLASIE STARTS TO BANG THEM IN . Yannick Bolasie has been one of the main reasons behind Crystal Palace\u2019s incredible run of form this year. Alongside Wilfried Zaha and Jason Puncheon he has formed an incredibly potent attacking trio. Everything he does happens at blistering speed and he absolutely terrorises defenders. He\u2019s such a tricky player and quite old-fashioned in the way he hugs the touchline and takes defenders on. But the very best wide men don\u2019t just create goals, they score them as well. If he keeps firing them in like he did at Sunderland, then his value is only going to go up. Yannick Bolasie has been one of the main reasons behind Crystal Palace\u2019s incredible run of form this year . HOMEGROWN STARS . Francis Coquelin and Harry Kane have been the two breakthrough players of the year and in positions where their clubs needed reinforcements. Coquelin has become such a strong presence in Arsenal\u2019s midfield and Kane is a striking star for Spurs. It just goes to show you don\u2019t always have to go out and spend huge money to solve a problem. The answer can be right under your nose. Harry Kane's progress\u00a0goes to show you don\u2019t always have to go out and spend huge money to solve issues . SPURS STAGNATE . That was a big win for Tim Sherwood at White Hart Lane. It gave Aston Villa some vital points and he also proved a point to his old employers. But how much has really changed at Spurs? If it weren\u2019t for Harry Kane, there would be some serious criticism heading their way \u2014 as the table below shows, they have not improved on last year. It is still a young team and they have time on their side but yet again their season is over sooner than it should be. Tim Sherwood enjoyed Aston Villa's win at White Hart Lane, it proved a point and earned vital league points . TRUE MASTERS . I was lucky enough to go Augusta this week to watch some of the golf and it was fantastic to see how hard all the players work. Plenty of footballers fancy themselves as golfers but these guys show just how dedicated you must be to be the best.",

These days we are more connected than ever, but that regularly pushes a potential partner further away. Smart phones and social media often cause nightmare for men and women on dates (picture posed by models) On a date in the 1990s, the biggest fails a person could be responsible for were a lack of conversation, food in the teeth or a man asking\u00a0the\u00a0woman to split the bill. Nowadays, the man or woman is also likely to try and\u00a0photograph\u00a0their food or keep\u00a0checking\u00a0their phone at\u00a0the\u00a0table. Girls are often caught out spending too much time in the bathroom, while they compare notes on their evening with friends as their date is sat back at the table. And after the evening is over both parties can fall foul of the temptation to get in touch too quickly - texting within hours of the meeting or checking out the other person's Facebook profile immediately. While on a date it is considered rude to leave your phone on the table \u00a0(picture posed by models) To save the\u00a0embarrassment\u00a0of being chucked before the relationship has heated up because of your addiction to technology, Blu e-cigarettes have listed the top ten ways to avoid showing yourself up. They include leaving conversations about the dating app Tinder to evenings with your friends, and checking with a potential boyfriend or girlfriend before changing your relationship on Facebook. - Keep phones off the dining table; your date wants to see your face, not your screen. - Don\u2019t be tempted to take a snap of your food for instagram - it will look like you\u2019re more interested in your followers than your date. - Refrain from \u2018checking in\u2019 your location online too; it could easily turn into a \u2018live-tweet\u2019 scenario or worse, a \u2018helpful\u2019 friend might drop by to see how it\u2019s going. - Keep it offline; immediately changing your relationship status on Facebook if the date\u2019s gone well is a sure-fire way to scare off your date. - If it goes really well, it might be time to move the chat away from text; take it to the next level and give them a call a few days after the date. - Do keep your taxi app handy in case you need to make a quick exit from a date disaster and you don\u2019t have any cash . - If you must update your friends on how the date\u2019s going, use snapchat \u2013 it won\u2019t leave any evidence! - Don\u2019t brag about the number of matches you\u2019ve had on Tinder, they won\u2019t appreciate it . - Don\u2019t assume your date will find that funny cat meme as hilarious as your friends did! - And finally, leave the Google Glass at home, as recording your companion for post-date analysis isn\u2019t likely to get you a second date .",

        "article": "A student remains under police guard in hospital after being kidnapped, tortured with pliers and forced to drink bleach by masked men in an apparent revenge attack for 'accidentally scraping a man's car'. Motaz Zaid, who is currently studying economics at the University of Greenwich, was with a friend in St Marks Close in Parsons Green, south west London, in the early hours of Friday when the group of thugs targeted them. His friend, who wishes to remain anonymous, said the pair were sprayed with ammonia and assaulted with tools before Mr Zaid, 20, was bundled into a Mercedes C220 Estate and driven off. Motaz Zaid was with a friend in  Parsons Green, south west London, in the early hours of Friday when the group of thugs targeted them. Mr Zaid was apparently bundled into a Mercedes by masked men and attacked . The friend, 19, who was stabbed several times in the back and legs during the ordeal, was left for dead in the quiet residential street while Mr Zaid was found dumped a few miles away, close to the A3 on the border of New Malden and Parsons Green. Police became alerted to the incident after spotting the vehicle in Beverley Way, Kingston, at about 1am. Uniformed officers approached the stationary car, but it drove off and fled from the scene despite attempts by police to pursue it. Officers then discovered Mr Zaid dumped on the side of the road with life-threatening injuries. He was taken to a south London hospital, which cannot be named for security reasons, where he remains in a critical condition. His friend was also taken to hospital with stab wounds but was later discharged. The friend recalled the incident today and told the\u00a0Evening Standard: 'They had been parked waiting for him to get back. As we both got out of the car, these five guys just jumped us. They sprayed something in our eyes and it blocked our vision. 'They weren't after me, they were beating him up. I tried to fight them off and to grab him but he was on the floor and not moving. I hit one of them in the face and three of them chased me into the main road and stabbed me. 'By the time I got back to my friend the car had left and I thought he had got away but after looking for him I realised they had taken him in the car.' Mr Zaid, 20, who is currently studying economics at the University of Greenwich, was found dumped at the side of the A3 in\u00a0Beverley Way, Kingston, south west London (above). He remains in hospital with critical injuries . Mr Zaid's father Azz said his son's injuries were 'very serious', adding: 'My heart is broken when I see my son like that. I can't believe anyone could do that to another human being.' He said he believes the incident is in response to a minor altercation last week. He said his son was allegedly involved in an accident with another car, in which one of the vehicles became slightly damaged. He claims the other driver refused to negotiate a settlement and threatened violence if his son did not pay \u00a3400. Metropolitan Police said officers from the Trident Gang Crime Command are currently investigating the incident and trying to trace the suspects . Officers confirmed the car involved was a Mercedes C220 Estate but said it is not known how many suspects were in the vehicle. Scotland Yard confirmed no arrests have yet been made in connection with the incident. Anyone with information should contact police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.",

        "article": "It is a superfood with numerous health benefits, but our enthusiasm for almond milk is causing a storm in the US. Almond growers in California are at the centre of a row over water usage during one of the worst droughts in decades. The state, which supplies more than three-quarters of the world's $4.93billion(\u00a33.3bn) almond market, is in its fourth year of drought. Scroll down for videos . Dry days: Homes with swimming pools are seen in the Palm Springs area, California, as the state enters its fourth year of severe drought . This has also seen local residents attack the bottled water industry, after it was revealed that several companies have been 'taking advantage of poor government oversight to deplete mountain streams and watersheds,' The Guardian reports. A campaign singles out Nestle as the main villain, after an investigation by a local newspaper found that the company has been sourcing water from some of the driest areas in the state using expired permits. An online petition demanding that the company seizes production of bottled water in California with immediate effect has garnered more than 150,000 signatures. Despite the ongoing drought,  almond growers, who require a gallon of water to produce a single nut, are still planting trees. The industry's growth is being driven by the public's clamour for a food with benefits for the heart, the bones and metabolism. Still going: Almond growers in California are at the centre of a row over water usage during one of the worst droughts in decades . Almonds are high in potassium, calcium, vitamin E and magnesium, and are thought to reduce cholesterol and decrease hunger without leading to weight gain . A gardener works on a golf course in La Quinta, California, as residents campaign against the bottled drinks industry and almond growers in a bid to stop the drought . Almonds are high in potassium, calcium, vitamin E and magnesium, and are thought to reduce cholesterol and decrease hunger without leading to weight gain. Unlike cows' milk, almond milk \u2013 which is made from ground nuts and water \u2013 has no cholesterol or lactose, and being a plant food, it is often consumed by vegans, vegetarians, and others forgoing dairy. David Cameron is said to be a fan, and Sainsbury's reported a 181 per cent sales increase in the milk last year. But in California, there is growing anger that while most people are facing water rations, the almond industry has been left to expand its orchards and guzzle all the water it wants. Tom Stokely, of the California Water Impact Network, told the Sunday Telegraph: 'There has been a huge expansion of almonds. As we speak, there are yet more almond orchards being planted. In many cases the farmers are planting them in areas of low water supply so groundwater is being over-drafted. 'They're doing it because there are such huge profits. Now they're asking the rest of us to give up our water so they can stay in business.' Unlike cows' milk, almond milk \u2013 which is made from ground nuts and water \u2013 has no cholesterol or lactose, and being a plant food, it is often consumed by vegans, vegetarians, and others forgoing dairy . But the almond industry insists it needs the resources. Brad Gleason, a grower in Fresno County, said: 'I'm proud to be a farmer of almonds. We produce something real and healthy that contributes mightily to the economy of California. 'Some of the old-timers still remember when this stretch of Fresno County belonged to the horned toad, jack rabbit and tumbleweed. Demonising us, and what we grow, is no way to meet the challenge. We're not the bad guys.' Governor Jerry Brown also defended his decision to exempt agriculture from the water consumption cap, saying: 'Agriculture is an important pillar of California.' Pineapple lovers are facing hefty hikes in the price of their favourite fruit, according to a report yesterday. Pineapple prices have soared to their highest level for almost three years as a result of poor weather in Costa Rica, which has led to plummeting supplies. Trade magazine The Grocer said that while retail prices of many fruit and vegetable lines had fallen over recent months, the average price of a loose pineapple in the biggest UK supermarkets has risen to $2.41(\u00a31.61) \u2013 up from $2.21(\u00a31.48) in March. Costa Rica is the world's biggest exporter of pineapples, accounting for 90 per cent of the global fresh supply, but recent cold and wet weather had hit this year's harvest.",

Louisa Steckenreuter, 35, a mother to two young children,  Darcy, 13, and  Tilda, 2, was diagnosed with\u00a0Osteosarcoma, a rare form of cancer last year. Now to have a chance at accessing potentially life-saving treatment the woman from Dulwich Hill, in Sydney's inner-west, needs to raise $100,000. 'What we\u2019re hoping is that it gives me longer to spend time with my kids and watch them grow up. And grow old with husband like we had planned' Louisa Steckenreuter is desperately trying to raise money for an expensive cancer treatment which could buy her more time with her family . 'I was diagnosed on the 23rd of June last year,' Ms\u00a0Steckenreuter told Daily Mail Australia. 'I had pain my shoulder, I sort of regularly had muscle pain in my neck and shoulder anyway but then it just got incredibly intense and for a while they thought it was something called a shoulder impingement,' she continued. 'Then they did an x-ray and saw that the bone was very unhealthy and they did a biopsy and found out it was cancer.' Since then the mother-of-two has undergone eight rounds of intravenous chemotherapy, which while it helped also made her very unwell. 'My oncologist has recommended I try this new drug. It\u2019s called Keytruda',\u00a0Ms Steckenreuter said. It works differently to chemotherapy, which attacks all the cells in the system, even healthy ones. Ms Steckenreuter, 35, a mother to two young children, Darcy, 13, and Tilda, 2, was diagnosed with Osteosarcoma, a rare form of cancer last year . The mum-of-two was diagnosed after she went in for an x-ray on a sore shoulder . 'I was diagnosed on the 23rd of June last year,' Ms Steckenreuter told Daily Mail Australia . 'Whereas the Keytruda works with your body\u2019s immune system and recognises the fact that the body\u2019s immune system is able to fight the cancer cells if they realise the cells are bad,' Ms\u00a0Steckenreuter explained. However the drawback is the medication costs $6000 a month, and is not subsidised on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. It is usually used to treat patients with advanced melanomas. Since the diagnosis she has undergone eight rounds of intravenous chemotherapy, which while it helped also made her very unwell . Ms Steckenreuter turned to a new drug,\u00a0Keytruda, to help fight off the deadly disease. Her doctors believe it may help her . Ms Steckenreuter said her oncologist,\u00a0Professor David Thomas, said he believes the treatment might work for her, and others in a similar situation . 'The reason he thinks it will work is that sarcoma and melanoma cancer cells are built in a similar way and respond in a similar way,' she said. 'What we\u2019re hoping is that it gives me longer to spend time with my kids and watch them grow up. 'And grow old with husband like we had planned,' Ms\u00a0Steckenreuter said. 'The reason he thinks it will work is that sarcoma and melanoma cancer cells are built in a similar way and respond in a similar way,' she said . Louisa and her husband, Andre, were married in 2010 .

The mother-of-two said at first she was hesitant to ask for donations, but by putting herself out there as the first Australian to try this drug for her type of cancer she might help others. 'I\u2019m just a trial,' she said. 'It's not just for me, if they see it\u2019s working in the first few months it means others can be treated with it.' Just before speaking to Daily Mail Australia on Sunday, an anonymous donor had pledged $10,000 to Ms\u00a0Steckenreuter's cause. She broke down in tears when told about the donation, and vowed to find out who the generous person was so she could thank them. The Sydney woman isn't quite halfway to her $100,000 target and has so far raised $48,670, but needs more so she can try this drug which has a good chance of buying her more time.

        "article": "They are supposed to be a girl's best friend - or at least her most valuable. But the diamond ring appears to have lost its sparkle according to experts who claim that women are abandoning the traditional jewel in favour of more exotic gems. The huge increase in demand for coloured stones, such as sapphires and rubies, has seen their prices soar. Scroll down for video . Kate Middleton proudly wore a Ceylon sapphire once owned by Princess Diana as her engagement ring . And experts say the trend might prove that diamonds are not forever after all, as the value of the jewels has been vastly overtaken by more fashionable stones. Demand has seen the value of some coloured stones increase by more than 2,000 per cent over the last ten years, with leading auctioneers now branding them a better investment than diamonds. Celebrities such as Kate Middleton, who proudly wore a Ceylon sapphire once owned by Princess Diana as her engagement ring, have driven the craze. A-list stars Beyonc\u00e9, Naomi Watts, Rosamund Pike and Mila Kunis have also played their part by flashing their beloved coloured gems on the red carpet. The number of women picking their own engagement rings is also thought to have had an effect, with men always likely to choose a traditional diamond. While diamonds are still broadly worth more money than softer stones such as emeralds, the increase in price generated by coloured stones in recent years has far overtaken diamonds. A-list stars Rosamund Pike by flashing beloved coloured gems on the red carpet . As the gems are much rarer than diamonds the surge in demand - especially from Asia - has played a significant part in driving up their cost. The surging popularity of coloured stones is one of the reasons leading auctioneers Bonhams include them in most sales around the world, alongside diamonds. Its auctioneers were delighted when a pair of 1930 Cartier art deco ruby and diamond brooches recently sold for \u00a3482,500, far outstripping the presale estimate of \u00a380,000 - \u00a3120,000. A single-stone ring by Van Cleef & Arpels featuring a Burmese ruby weighing 13.34 carats, sold for \u00a3350,500 to a Hong Kong buyer, breaking price-per-carat records in the UK last year. Jean Ghika, head of jewellery in the UK and Europe at Bonhams, said that as well as being fashionable colured stones are also becoming seen as a sound investment. She said: 'There is a new move towards colour. Women are bolder in their choices and looking at alternatives to diamonds when it comes to engagement rings and everyday jewellery. 'Women are also in constant pursuit of something truly original, and a coloured stone, where every example is different they are able to have something unique. 'As ever, fashion is partly celebrity-led and we're seeing some of the world's biggest stars looking stunning in coloured gemstones on the red carpet.' Actress Mila Kunis also played her part, seen here wearing ruby jewellery to the Jupiter Ascending premiere . A ring featuring a Sri Lankan sapphire weighing 30.08 carats was recently sold by the auctioneers for \u00a3326,500. Bonhams said that a near identical ring sold a decade earlier for only \u00a311,950, equating to a 2,200 per cent increase in price-per-carat. Miss Ghika added: 'Diamonds are typically seen as the more 'robust' area in the gemstone market in terms of seeing a return on investment. 'But figures over the last decade demonstrate that coloured stones have actually overtaken diamonds in terms of growth.' A new world record for the most expensive ruby, regarded as the most valuable coloured gem, was set last year when a 8.62 carat Burmese stone sold for \u00a35.4million.",

Nigel Short, 49, said women were not suited to playing chess because it required logical thinking. The chess commentator and writer said women should accept they were \u2018hard-wired very differently\u2019 and weren\u2019t as adept at playing chess as men. Mr Short, who was the first English player to play a World Chess Championship match, made the comments when explaining why there were so few women in competitive chess. Nigel Short has controversially claimed women were not suited to playing chess because it required logical thinking . But critics immediately pointed out that he lost a high-profile game against a woman grandmaster. He told New in Chess magazine: \u2018Why should [men and women] function in the same way? \u2018I don\u2019t have the slightest problem in acknowledging that my wife [Rea] possesses a much higher degree of emotional intelligence than I do. 'Likewise, she doesn\u2019t feel embarrassed in asking me to manoeuvre the car out of our narrow garage. \u2018One is not better than the other, we just have different skills. It would be wonderful to see more girls playing chess, and at a higher level, but rather than fretting about inequality, perhaps we should just gracefully accept it as a fact.\u2019 His comments mirror those of his rival Garry Kasparov, who infamously said: \u2018Women, by their nature, are not exceptional chess players: they are not great fighters.\u2019 Female chess players reacted angrily to Mr Short\u2019s statements last night. Hungarian Judit Polgar, above, the former women\u2019s world champion, beat Nigel Short eight classical games to three in total . Amanda Ross, the leader of the Casual Chess club in London, told The Daily Telegraph the comments were \u2018incredibly damaging when someone so respected basically endorses sexism\u2019. She added: \u2018Judit Polgar, the former women\u2019s world champion, beat Nigel Short eight classical games to three in total, with five draws. \u2018She must have brought her man brain. \u2018Let\u2019s just hope Nigel didn\u2019t crash his car on those days, trying to park it. 'At least this resolves the age-old debate as to whether there\u2019s a direct link between chess-playing ability and intelligence. Clearly not.\u2019 Mr Short responded to Miss Ross\u2019s comments on Twitter, writing: You seem to suffer from incomprehension. \u2018Men and women do have different brains. This is a biological fact. \u2018Furthermore, I never said women have inferior brains. That is your crude and false attempt to caricature me.\u2019 Less than two per cent of grandmasters are female, but Hungarian Miss Polgar broke into the upper echelons of the game when she became one of the youngest grandmasters of all time at the age of 15.",

The F1 world champion was spotted on the Rome set for the comedy sequel, in a scene that looked like Ben Stiller's male model was taking part in a catwalk show with Owen Wilson's Hansel. Cameo: Lewis Hamilton and Olivia Munn film scenes in Rome for Zoolander 2 . Hamilton was sat front row with Olivia Munn and busily chatting in between takes on Friday. He donned a stylish red camouflage suit with a white shirt and sunglasses for the runway scene while Olivia\u00a0wore a shaggy fur coat over the shoulders of a fashion forward dress. They happily chatted and showed each other their phones as they waited for the scene to be set. At one point, star and director Ben came over to chat to them, before changing into his Derek outfit. The British race car driver and actress have done well to nab a coveted cameo in the comedy sequel . The scene seems to show celebrities and fashionistas have gathered to watch Derek Zoolander's latest show . Lewis and Olivia happily chatted and checked out each other's phones in between takes .

        "article": "Indonesia's attorney-general has claimed that Bali Nine duo Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran will be put to death following the rejection of their last ditch legal appeals. The convicted Australian drug dealers learned about the ruling after an appeal against their death row sentence was allowed to proceed in Jakarta's state administrative court on Monday. The court decided against allowing the pair's lawyers to challenge Indonesian President Joko Widodo's decision to deny the two Australians clemency. Scroll down for video . Andrew Chan and\u00a0Myuran Sukumaran 's last-ditch legal appeal against their Indonesian death row sentence was heard on Monday in Jakarta's state administrative court . Indonesia's HM Prasetyo said the pair would be executed soon and there would be no more delays as their latest court challenge failed . But attorney-general HM Prasetyo says he will not wait for another court challenge. 'No, there shall be no more (delays),' he said after Monday's verdict. 'This is proof of their tendency to delay ... it's like toying with law.' The attorney-general argued clemency was a matter of presidential prerogative only. 'For me it's enough. It's finished. It's finished,' he said. Lawyers for the men now plan to challenge the constitutional court to outline the president's obligations in clemency. They argue the executions should be stayed pending the new action, to be filed this week. The unusual appeal in the state administrative court was likely the pair's last legal avenue to save them from the firing squad for their part in the 2005 Bali Nine heroin smuggling bid. Sydney men Chan, 31, and Sukumaran, 33, have been awaiting execution on the death island of Nusakambangan with seven other prisoners after they were transferred from their home of almost ten years \u2013 Bali's notorious Kerobokan prison \u2013 in a dramatic show of force last month. No sparing: A judge (pictured) in the Indonesian state administrative court (pictured) reads out the decision in Jakarta on Monday ruling that Bali 9 ringleaders Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran will not be allowed to challenge the decision by President Joko Widodo to deny the Australians clemency . Shackled and handcuffed: Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran cut sad figures as they were escorted by four faceless Indonesian police officers across the tarmac after being taken from Korobokan prison in Bali to their final destination, Death Island . The federal government has also asked that new legal options be allowed to run their course. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said the government was disappointed by the court verdict. 'Both men have undergone extensive rehabilitation and I will continue to make representations to my counterpart, just as Australia will continue to use all diplomatic options to seek a stay of execution,' Ms Bishop said in a statement. 'Again, the Australian government respectfully requests the president to review their pleas for clemency.' The court in February rejected their legal challenge for clemency, determining the decrees by President Widodo were not within its jurisdiction. Lawyer for Chan and Sukumaran Leonard Arpan last week said they had done their best for their Australian clients. President Joko Widodo (pictured) previously rejected the Australian pair's clemency bids without studying the individual merits of each case, lawyers for the Bali 9 duo argued in the last ditch appeal on Monday . The pair are currently being held in isolation on Nusakambangan prison island (above) where foreign drug dealers were executed on January 18 this year and where the two Australians may be shot dead by firing squads on the same night as nine other drug dealers . Family members of Australian death row prisoners Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran (pictured) leave Nusakambangan prison island after visiting the two prisoners in Batu or 'stone' prison on March 9 this year . On Sunday, Jakarta's Catholic Archbishop, Ignatius Suharyo Hardjoatmodjo, told reporters he was saddened by Indonesia's use of the death penalty, which he described as a 'failure of humanity'. Also distressing for the archbishop was the severe treatment of Chan and Sukumaran when they were moved last month from their Bali jail cells to Nusakambangan, which involved a fighter jet escort. 'These men were handcuffed, was it necessary to be guarded by Sukhoi?' he told reporters after his Easter Sunday service. Surrounded by armed police officers officers and on the road of no return, 33-year-old Australia Myuran Sukumaran looks up at Bali police commissioner Djoko Hariutomo who posed with the two condemned Australians before their take off from Denpasar airport for the two hour flight to 'death island' A smiling Djoko Hariutomo, the police commissioner of the Balinese capital of Denpasar, poses for a photo with his hand upon the shoulder of condemned prisoner Andrew Chan inside the plane before take off for the Australian Bali Nine kingpin's final flight to the island where he will be executed . 'For me that's not strictness, for me that's very saddening because it's obvious that power wants to show itself and human dignity is not cherished.' Jakarta is awaiting all of the 10 prisoners in line for the firing squad to run out of options for court appeals before setting a date for their executions. Sukumaran and Chan are facing execution alongside Filipino woman Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso, French citizen Serge Areski Atlaoui, Ghanaian citizen Martin Anderson and the only Indonesian citizen among the group Zainal Abidin bin Mgs Mahmud Badarudin. Also facing the firing squad with the two Australians is Raheem Agbaje Salami, a Nigerian holding a Spanish passport, Brazilian citizen Rodrigo Gularte and Nigerian citizens Sylvester Obiekwe Nwolise and Okwudili Oyatanze. Seven of the convicted drug dealers facing death are (top row from left) Australians Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan, Frenchman Serge Atlaoui and Brazilian Rodrigo Gularte and (bottom row from left) Nigerian Raheem Agbaje Salami, Filipina Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso, and Nigerian Silvester Obiekwe Nwolise .",

Despite efforts by their lawyers to challenge the president's decision to deny them clemency, the court ruled that the president's decision was final and not subject to judicial review.

        "article": "Primary school children have been banned from running in the playground in case they fall over and injure themselves. Pupils at Riverview Junior School in Gravesend, Kent were told they could not move around too quickly because they might bump their heads. Parents are furious about the ban - saying that children need to 'let off steam' during their breaks as well as getting exercise by running around. Banned: Pupils including Bradley, Luca, Mia and Diesel (pictured left to right) have been told they cannot run in the playground at Riverview Junior School in Gravesend . Rachael Sparks said that her 11-year-old son Diesel had returned home upset after being told not to run outside at school. She said that she checked with headmistress Pam Wenbam, because she could not believe that it was true, before realising that a ban had in fact been imposed. 'I went in to school to speak to them as I thought he must have misunderstood,' Ms Sparks said. 'What else is a playground for in a primary school if not for running around and letting off a bit of steam? 'I was lucky enough to get to speak to the head, Ms Wenban. I said, \"I just want to clarify if this is true.\" 'She started off by saying we've asked them to slow down a bit, but then it transpired that they had banned running.' Safety: Staff at the school, pictured, say they are trying to crack down on a dangerous 'chasing' game . The school claims that the ban is intended to tackle a specific 'chasing' game which has caused children to hurt themselves. Ms Sparks said: 'She went on to say that due to some children not looking where they were going, there had been incidents of bumped heads. 'She claimed due to this it was her duty of care towards the children that had prompted her to ban running. They are not allowed to play British Bulldog, they are not allowed to play football. 'I know children do get the occasional bump to the head or grazed knee while running around on the playground but having spoken to a number of parents as well as children, 100 per cent of both expressed that running and getting the occasional minor injury was most definitely preferable to not running at all. 'I don't want to run the school down but I think it is a step too far. Kids have been bumping their heads and grazing their knees for hundreds of years.' Ms Wenband said: 'We have asked children to refrain from playing a particular chasing game in the playground as we have found the increasing numbers taking part has caused some injuries, including a fractured collarbone. 'We are concerned for the safety of the children and need to stop this particular game until we can establish a safer way for them to play. 'When the weather is dry and sunny children can run and play more safely on the school playing field.'",

'We\u2019ve done so much training together that I found running the first half on my own a bit strange but it made our reunion even more meaningful.

An Australian festival organiser has slammed Tasmania as a state full 'dregs, bogans and third-generation morons'. In a scathing article, long time restaurant critic and festival curator Leo Schofield, 79, claimed living in Tasmania was the unhappiest time of his life and the decade he spent there left him feeling bitter and depressed. 'I think I came very close to either a nervous breakdown or suicide. I just started to fall apart,' he told Fairfax. Mr Schofield moved to Hobart to set up a Baroque music festival in what he claims was an attempt to help Tasmanians take advantage of its grand heritage. He decided to relocate back to New South Wales after the Tasmanian Government cut the festivals funding by 25 per cent. Mr Schofield said he was offered $300,000 for the 2014 festival which was a reduction from the $400,000 the government offered in the previous year. 'We were deeply wounded and shocked,' he said. '[The festival] was supported by a lot of wonderful people down there, who shared the vision that the government wouldn't. Anyhow, we threw up our hands and said, 'We're not going to do it anymore. F**k you.' Mr Schofield moved to Hobart to set up a Baroque music festival, but decided to relocate back to New South Wales after the Tasmanian Government cut the festivals funding by 25 per cent . After receiving an offer from Queensland arts organisations he decided to move the festival to Brisbane. Mr Schofield said his daughters recognised that the battle he was waging with the Tasmanian Government took a toll on him and decided to stage an 'intervention'. 'The whole process knocked me about terribly and I honestly started going to pieces,' he said. 'I was drinking, I was taking a lot of tablets, and stupidly driving when I was in no condition to drive. I was suffering from acute depression.' While Mr Schofield admits he was 'absolutely obsessed, tremendously intrigued' by Tasmania, he continued to blast Tasmanian's for wanting to 'dig it up, chop it down, sell it to the Chinese.' Luke Martin from the Tourism Industry Council of Tasmania Tweeted the above after\u00a0Mr Schofield said of Tasmania:\u00a0'All the young people leave, and the only ones left are the dregs, the bogans, the third-generation morons' He added the above despite\u00a0Mr Schofield saying he\u00a0suffered from acute depression after the mishap . He continued: 'All the young people leave, and the only ones left are the dregs, the bogans, the third-generation morons'. He said he plans to reserve a chapter in his memoirs dedicated to his time in Tasmania called 'Revenge of the Bogans'. Luke Martin from the Tourism Industry Council of Tasmania responded to Mr Schofield's comments labelling them as 'blatant mistruths'. He tweeted: 'No one cut his funding, he asked for more and spat the dummy when it wasn't given'.",

        "article": "The Balinese woman who hired hitmen to murder her Australian husband has told a court that she wanted to teach him a lesson because he refused to give her money or grant her a divorce. Noor Ellis admitted a role in the killing of her 60-year-old husband, businessman Robert Ellis, at their home in Bali last October. His body, with wrists and feet bound, was found wrapped in plastic, dumped in a ditch in a rice field near Sedang Village. Mrs Ellis faced court on Wednesday charged with the premeditated killing of her husband of 20 years, and explained that he was now 'in heaven'. Scroll down for video . British man Robert Kelvin Ellis (left), here with wife Noor Ellis (right) was found in a rice paddock with his throat cut in October 2014 . Mrs Ellis told Judge Beslin Sihombing that her husband died 'Because of the order from me'. The Balinese national, who has two sons with her late husband, was arrested along with seven other people, including the couple's two former maids and the boyfriend of one of the maids. 'For a long time he hadn't given me sufficient (money), (he) even took the money for my kids' schooling,' Mrs Ellis told the court. 'Because his attitude didn't change, I couldn't stand it anymore. Once I asked for divorce but he didn't want to,' she said. 'He said we should just go on, in our own way.' 23-year-old Urbanus Yohanes Ghoghi, who slit Mr Ellis's throat, told the court on Wednesday in graphic detail of the roles he and four other men played in the killing. Noor Ellis gave one of the men, Martin, a towel and a pillow, and asked his 'help to teach a lesson'. The men first tried to suffocate him, but when their victim fought back, Martin handed him the kitchen knife he used to slash his throat. Already in custody for his murder is his Indonesian wife of 25 years, Noor Ellis, the couple's two maids and the boyfriend of one of the maids . If the suspects are found guilty of murder, they could face the death penalty . 60-year-old Robert Ellis's (left) body was found wrapped in plastic with his wrists and feet bound and was dumped in a ditch in a rice field near Sedang Village. Sons Peter (centre) and John (right) now face the loss of their mother too if she gets the death penalty for their father's murder . Afterwards, Mrs Ellis handed Martin the plastic to wrap her husband's body in, Urbanus told the court. 'That night, Mrs Noor gave Rp 50 million ($5000) to Martin. It was then split, Rp 10 million each,' he said. 'Martin also said to us that tomorrow, there will be more.' In early January police reportedly handed a brief of evidence to prosecutors which claimed the victim\u2019s wife paid hit-men 150 million rupiah, or $14,200 AUD, according to The Daily Telegraph. The court heard that Mrs Ellis told her husband's killers 'to be neat' when they murdered him, and called a meeting prior to his murder to ensure the men knew the instructions. 'Mrs Noor said that when killing Mr Bob, don't use a sharp weapon,' Urbanus said. 'Close his nose and mouth with a pillow only. To be neat, basically.' Julaikah Noor Aini, known as Noor Ellis (second left) takes part in a reconstruction of her husband's murder . Mrs Ellis faces the death penalty if she is found guilty of the charge of premeditated murder, which her two sons, Peter and John, said they are reconciled to. Both sons have refused to attend their mother\u2019s court hearing, and said that they want to see justice for their father. \u2018If that [the death penalty] happens, it happens,\u2019 Peter told Channel Seven's Sunday Night program. \u2018But we want justice for our dad no matter what.\u2019 Mr Ellis was set upon in his own Bali kitchen by the killers who slashed his throat 'like killing a pig', police said, after Mrs Ellis employed the men along with two housemaids to clean up the murder. His wife, who was taken into custody after confessing to her role in the crime, helped local officials to recreate the murder. Mr Ellis' body had have been lying in a ditch for several days and was in a state of decay . 'There is no doubt this was an execution-style murder,' said a senior police officer in the Bali capital, Denpasar. Mr Ida Bagus Putu Alit, who headed the district's forensic team, said Mr Ellis' throat had been slashed three times. 'One of the wounds to the throat was fatal, but he also had several bruises around his head, suggesting he had been knocked to the ground before receiving the fatal throat wound,' he said. Peter and John text messaged their mother to ask where their father was to which she chillingly replied, \u2018I\u2019ll ask him when I see him.\u2019 When Ellis was arrested at the end of last year, she admitted to police and her two Perth-based sons that she paid $14,000 to men to carry out the murder with her motive likely being his $30 million estate. Noor\u2019s lawyers have claimed that Robert was abusive and the hit men were only paid to scare her husband, not murder him. Officials said Mr Ellis, who has been living in Australia, had a UK passport, and is believed to have moved to the seaside area of Sanur, Bali with his wife . Noor and Robert's son John Ellis (in grey shirt) arrive at Bali police station in October to visit his mother . Robert Kelvin Ellis was found dead in a rice field near the village of Sedang, north of Denpasar in Bali . Police have also alleged Noor confessed to ordering his murder because he cheated on her 'often' and has claimed that she was possessed by a spirit or a monster and pushed to organise Robert\u2019s killing by an outside supernatural force. Her sons, Peter and John Ellis have told The West Australian of the perils they face, not only of a life without their father, but potentially without their mother as well. \u2018Mum felt like she wasn\u2019t being treated well enough, she wasn\u2019t given enough money,\u2019 Peter said. \u2018And her only option in her mind was to murder my dad.\u2019 Officials confirmed that Mr Ellis had a UK passport and had lived in Australia before moving to the seaside area of Sanur, Bali with his wife. Ellis also has two other children from a former relationship. At the time of their father\u2019s death, the four children and Mr Ellis\u2019 brother John released a joint statement. \u2018Bob was a loving and devoted father, grandfather, brother, son and husband. His loss leaves a hole in the lives of everyone he touched.\u2019 \u2018His work in business created jobs for thousands of Indonesians. He was a good and honourable man.

        "article": "The huge build-up to England women's Under 19 replay against Norway was truly bizarre and unprecedented. And it was a game only supposed to last for 18 seconds. Leah Williamson held incredible nerve to retake a penalty which she ought to have taken on Saturday, were it not for German referee Marjia Kurtes' terrific blunder. Kurtes disallowed Williamson's penalty for encroachment from England players at the weekend, but instead of ordering her back to the spot, awarded a free-kick to Norway. Leah Williamson (centre) stepped up again to take the penalty during the 18-second rematch against Norway . Williamson went the same way as her successful spot-kick last Saturday and found the net once again . Norwegian goalkeeper Oda Marie Hove Bogstad was unable to stop Williamson's brilliant effort . The England captain wheels away in celebration after handing her side a crucial 2-2 draw . But England were given a lifeline when UEFA chiefs ruled it should be replayed. All match details from Saturday, including the time of day the penalty was awarded, the venue, the players who were on the pitch, were ticked off by the Swiss blazers and the game was restarted at 9.45pm. And that was a whole FIVE hours after both had played their final Elite Round games in Northern Ireland. Only Kurtes was replaced, by referee Kateryna Zora. It began in what would have been the 96th minute, and ended 65 seconds later. Leah said: 'They were the longest 24 hours of my life, I hadn't slept. I think I was just excited, I went through so many emotions and just felt excitement, so I thought 'yep, that's how I am going to feel'! 'We had a conversation just before I came out which was quite emotional, we have been through a bigger journey than some people go through in their whole careers because of what happened, it was never about me, it was about the team. The England players celebrate Williamson's penalty which earned them a 2-2 draw in Belfast . England held on in the final moments to secure the draw and, with it, a place in this summer's finals in Israel . Williamson blows a kiss to the crowd as Mo Marley's side look ahead to this summer's tournament . Number of seconds played: 65.18 after the players returned to the centre circle . Number of England players on the pitch:\u00a0Norway were already down to 10 outfield players, but England brought on a sub to replace one injured in the game vs Switzerland . Days between spot-kicks: Five days between Saturday's clash and the controversial rematch . Number of goals scored: 1 - the infamous penalty . 'When something is taken away from you like that, you realise just how much you want it, and that's what happened. Qualifying is such a huge deal for us, it's massive.' Norway discovered minutes before the penalty was retaken they would qualify for the July finals in Israel, as best runners-up across all Elite Round groups. Had the penalty been missed, Norway would have finished table-toppers, and the Dutch would have progressed as best second-placed team. It was the most surreal football you could imagine, starting from the penalty spot, with none of the regular pomp of a competitive international, yet much more attention than a girls' game normally yields. Under-age women's games in Northern Ireland, if the passionate hosts aren't playing, are usually lucky to attract treble figures. England are awarded a penalty during their European U19 Women's Championships qualifier on Saturday . Referee Marija Kurtes points to the spot as England are awarded a penalty in the 96th minute . Williamson steps up to take a penalty in the closing stages of the match against Norway in Belfast . Williamson runs forward to strike the ball but team-mate Rosella Ayane (circled) has entered the box . Williamson turns and celebrates as she slots the ball into the goalkeeper's bottom-right corner . German referee Marija Kurtes officiating a women's Bundesliga match in Munich last month . England players celebrate after they thought they had equalised against Norway . But referee Kurtes awards an indirect free-kick and the celebrations are cut short . Williamson has the ball back in her hands ready for what she thought would be a retake . While the disgraced Kurtes, who was sent home after her blunder, will be keen to shelve her nightmare, Williamson's name will crop up in pub quizzes for generations. England coach Mo Marley said: 'Obviously the tournament has been tough and pretty much it's about following through in the right way. We are happy we gave ourselves a chance to qualify and everything has turned out the way we wanted it, for Norway as well. 'I know how hard these players have worked, credit to all of the other teams, and credit to Norway, we deserve to be in the finals. 'It's ironic because a lot of the hard work we did at the start of the week was about a long journey, handling the intense pressure of a tournament and tests to our resolve, which helped a lot. But Williamson then realises the referee's decision and two Norwegian players are seen celebrating . German referee Kurtes is understood to have been sent home following her error on Saturday . 'Everyone was aware of the possible outcomes, we may not have scored the penalty, we know that. 'We may not have got through. But we are just so tremendously happy.' Since this odd chain of events stemmed from an infringement of the game's laws, UEFA's disciplinary committee did exactly the right thing in instructing for it to be replayed. But it sets a dangerous precedent. England's appeal cost just \u00a3750, which is repayable to the FA as it was successful, but was it lodged just because it's arguably a lower level of football? It triggers questions concerning how many more appeals of this nature could happen in the future. In a men's senior England international, one presumes one of the tens of thousands of people would correct the referee, whereas perhaps the same can't be guaranteed with a three-figure crowd. Indeed, would you have that inexcusable refereeing in the first place? September 2005 - World Cup qualifier - Uzbekistan vs Bahrain . Uzbekistan had won the opening leg of the Asian zone fourth-round play-off 1-0 at home but were left incensed after a penalty was disallowed in the 38th minute for an attacking player encroaching. Rather than retaking the penalty, an indirect free-kick was wrongly awarded by Japanese referee Toshimitsu Yoshida\u00a0to Bahrain and the game ended with a one-goal margin. Uzbekistan called for an investigation but were left furious after FIFA ordered the match to be replayed in its entirety with the result declared invalid. It proved to have a major impact as it was Bahrain who eventually went through with a 1-1 away goals victory, though they were later beaten in the AFC-CONCACAF play-off. Bahrain staff and players celebrate after beating Uzbekistan in an Asian World Cup qualifier in 2005 .",

The little cub was found abandoned outside the city's circus in February, and was taken to Sadgorod Zoo. He is one of many bear cubs rescued by special groups across Russia this spring, often after illegal hunters kill their mothers. Scroll down for video . All alone: Mitya the baby bear, was found abandoned outside a circus in Vladivostok, east Russia, earlier this year . Not camera shy: Mitya was taken to Sadgorod Zoo where he joined two young cubs also believed to have been orphaned as a result of hunting . Also at Sadgorod Zoo in Vladivostok, eastern Russia, are two one-month-old twins who were found all alone in the wild. Zoo owner Alyona Asnovina said: 'They were left with no mother in sight and wouldn't be able to survive on their own. When the twins grow up, perhaps they'll be put in the forest.' Mitya has since been moved to a private zoo where he has found a permanent home. Four time zones to the west, in Omsk, three bears have been taken in after their mother was shot by a hunter. Named as Busya, Musya and Vorchun they are being fed cow's milk with honey and enjoy playing with furry toys and on a wooden stairway. Play time: One of three bear siblings rescued in Omsk after a hunter killed their mother plays with a carers glove and a fluffy toy . Sibling love: These two cubs were found in the wild without their mother, and carers at Sadgorod Zoo believe she had been killed . Dinner time: A very happy baby bear gets fed dinner at Sadgorod Zoo . The\u00a0two one-month-old twins who were found all alone in the wild, but are flourishing in the care of Sadgorod Zoo workers . Cuddle time: A member of staff plays with the baby bears at the zoo . Staff hope that the twins, who are yet to be named, can be released back into the wild . Back east, in Siberia, Masha the bear cub is being hailed as a real life Paddington after being flown business class to a new home in Moscow. The fluffy native of the Russian Far East was found as a new born cub on a doorstep in the Russian Far East. Masha and her brother were left outside a family home in the city of Khabarovsk, perhaps by the hunter, and were fortunate to be rescued. . 'It is thought their mother was killed by poachers,' reported The Siberian Times. The abandoned Hymalayan or black bears were taken to the local zoo, but the male cub sadly died. 'Masha has flourished and now three-months-old, she has a new life at an animal sanctuary in Moscow. Transaero airline provided a free ticket for animal protection officer Natalya Kovalenko, with pictures showing Masha with her in the business class cabin. 'On board Masha was conveniently accommodated in its carrying case and curiously examined the aircraft cabin and passengers, who were amazed and enjoyed to see such a nice fellow traveller,' said a statement issued by the airline. Big journey: Masha the bear was rescued in Siberia before finding a new home at a sanctuary in Moscow . Hugh flier: In order for her to get to hew new home, Masha was allowed to fly business class from Siberia to the capital . 'Like all kids, the little bear slept peacefully and soundly for most of the eight-hour flight. The bear was fed warm goat's milk with a bottle several times during the flight.' In fact the images show the bear enjoying the view out of the plane's window and being looked after by attentive staff in the business class cabin on the eight hour 20 minute flight. 'She was treated as if she was Paddington Bear with no comfort spared,' said one source. In Moscow, the bear was brought to her new home, where she will live with other bears. Finally, a baby brown bear needed rescuing after being gifted as a birthday present to a young child in Perm in the Ural Mountains. A friend of the wealthy parents evidently gifted the orphaned cub. The parents took to the internet to check on what bears are like as they grow up, and were shocked to discover it could ravage their child. After a week in their home, they appealed for a new owner and the bear is to undergo training at Perm Circus. Animal trainer Yuri Nizhelsky said: 'The bear is good, and has no fear. 'Dogs did not attack it and people had no time to hurt, so the baby's mental state is stable.'",

        "article": "ISIS has launched English-language radio news bulletins on its Iraqi broadcast service - complete with information on the latest suicide bombings and 'martyrdom operations'. The extremist group's first English bulletin aired on Tuesday on its al-Bayan radio network, which already boasts updates in both Arabic and Russian. The nine-and-a-half minute broadcast, which begins and ends with traditional sounding Arabic music, is hosted by a man with an American accent, who takes the listener through the main events of the day. Round up: The broadcast, hosted by a man with an American accent, boasted of ISIS victories during the day. Pictured: Fighting in Yarmouk was high on the agenda of the radio broadcast . It provided an overview of the militants activities in Iraq, Syria and Libya, discussing a range of topics \u00a0- including the alleged death of an ISIS commander in the Yarmouk refugee camp in the Syrian capital, Damascus, a suicide bombing in the Iraqi city of Kirkuk and mortar attacks on militias in Sirte, Libya. It also boasts of ISIS fighters 'roasting the flesh' of their opponents, car bombs killing people and destroying an 'idol' and so-called 'martyrdom operations'. It ends thanking the listener for 'tuning in'. But the radio station is not the only option ISIS commanders are using to reach out to English-speakers: they already have a monthly propaganda magazine, Dabiq. The magazine - named after the Syrian town where a 'malahim', the equivalent to an Armageddon, in which the Muslims ultimately prevail - has so far issued eight editions, covering events like those in Paris and Sydney. It also boasts about some of its worst atrocities in the pages of the glossy booklet - which has even outlined a religious justification for slavery. Dominance?: Is the latest English medium to be used by ISIS - they already have an English magazine . Exactly why ISIS commanders have decided to branch out from print to radio now is not known, but it comes within days of it being revealed a new school of nursing in the militants' de facto capital Raqqa would only accept English-speaking applicants. Students graduating from ISIS' nursing school will be required to spend a full two years working for institutions run by the terrorist organisation after they finish training. However, English's dominance around the globe is likely to mean it is the most convenient language to use when communicating with the estimated 20,000 fighters from 90 countries around the globe who have joined ISIS.",

Deanna Robinson, of Quinlan, Texas, was 38 weeks pregnant when she says she was struck at least three times at her parents' home. She said deputies and state workers from Child Protective Services were present to remove her 18-month-old son because of allegations of abuse or neglect following a fight between her and her husband. Scroll down for video . A video has emerged which appears to show a deputy hitting Deanna Robinson, a heavily pregnant Iraq war veteran in the back at her home. Robinson was 38 weeks pregnant when she says she was struck at least three times in her back at her parents' home . Recalling the incident, Deanna Robinson said:\u00a0'I'm 38 weeks pregnant, and with my stomach again repeatedly pressed into that counter, and with my 18-month old son watching his mother be assaulted, and him screaming in fear' Robinson says her stomach hit the kitchen counter repeatedly during the incident, causing heavy bruising . There are photos of the alleged injuries on a Facebook group set up by friends about her case . The March 4 video shows a group of people in the kitchen of her parents' home - her mother is holding her son as two officers struggle with Robinson. Her parents' home surveillance system records in intervals - it captured about 30 seconds of the confrontation. Robinson, 38, is cornered and there are two officers behind her - she is not clearly visible, but is near the kitchen counter. In the video, which was posted to Facebook and YouTube, Robinson can be heard screaming 'Let go, you know I'm pregnant.' But then one of the officers appears to hit her with his fist and his arm raises again. The camera cuts off, but Robinson, who received the Air Force's highest honor, the Airman's Medal, after helping drag several soldiers from a burning plane in Iraq, insists he struck her about three of four more times. 'I'm 38 weeks pregnant, and with my stomach again repeatedly pressed into that counter, and with my 18-month old son watching his mother be assaulted, and him screaming in fear,' Robinson said to WFAA. 'There's nothing that warrants what they did to me.' Robinson is cornered and there are two officers behind her - she is not clearly visible.

Pictures of Robinson's stomach taken after her release show bruises covering a portion of her stomach, reports WFAA. Six days later her son, Levi (pictured) was born . On Monday Hunt County Sheriff Randy Meeks posted a statement on the department's Facebook page after the video went viral . She says CPS were called as she and her husband - with who she says she has a rocky relationship - \u00a0had an argument at their home. She says she went to her parent's home with her toddler son, but her stepson, who has cerebral palsy and is in a wheelchair, told his teacher about the incident - \u00a0who in turn reported it to CPS. On March 3, CPS investigators removed her three stepchildren - ranging in age from six to nine - from their home. Then Robinson received a call from a CPS investigator telling her that he wanted to talk to her about the incident as well as check up on her toddler son. But she says when they arrived, they told her they were they to take her son. She says she stepped in front of her son as she tried to close the door and put her hands up as she screamed 'No, you're not touching my kid.'

        "article": "Twickenham will stage a thunderous collision between two French juggernauts in 13 days\u2019 time, although Toulon\u2019s crusade to win an unprecedented third successive European title nearly stalled at Stade Velodrome on Sunday. On this faltering, unconvincing evidence, the holders of the last Heineken Cup face a mammoth task if they are to stop Clermont Auvergne from claiming the inaugural Champions Cup. Bernard Laporte\u2019s stellar side didn\u2019t come to life until this dismal encounter went into extra-time and they were only galvanised once they had been reduced to 14 men, when Ali Williams was sin-binned for taking out Devin Toner in the air. Toulon winger\u00a0Bryan Habana races away for a decisive try in extra-time against Leinster . Habana intercepted Ian Madigan's long pass to race away unopposed at Stade\u00a0Velodrome . Leinster full back Rob Kearney beats Toulon flanker\u00a0Juan Fernandez Lobbe to a high ball in the first-half . Instead of being undermined by the loss of the ex-All Blacks lock, Toulon scored the crucial points while he was off the field. Their victory was founded on the composed goal-kicking of their Welsh Lion at full-back, Leigh Halfpenny, who finished with 20 points from six penalties and a conversion. Leinster attempted to capitalise on their numerical advantage and it backfired in the 90th minute as Ian Madigan\u2019s long pass was intercepted by Bryan Habana and the Springbok wing stormed clear to for the game\u2019s only try. That the one fleeting flicker of creativity stemmed from an error was fitting. The Irish province wouldn\u2019t go quietly and when Sean O\u2019Brien went over from a close-range lineout drive, they were back in the hunt with five minutes remaining, but it wasn\u2019t to be. So, the climax of the new continental tournament will have a familiar feel. Toulon vs Clermont is an all-French repeat of the 2013 Heineken Cup Final in Dublin, which the Cote d\u2019Azur club won despite being dominated by Clermont for much of the game. Last year, they gave Jonny Wilkinson the perfect career sign-off with another triumph in Cardiff \u2013 where Saracens were dispatched \u2013 and now they are closing in on a hat-trick. But there was no swagger about them on Sunday, or any sustained power surges for that matter. It was unusually wet by the Mediterranean and the conditions made handling difficult, but that didn\u2019t account for the sheer deluge of fumbles made by both sides. As a showcase of Europe\u2019s elite event, this stop-start contest left much to be desired. For all the effort and commitment, there was no fluency or cohesion, no rhythm or flow. The teams simply took it in turns to launch a raid and either spill the ball or concede a turnover. Leinster centre Madigan fires over one of his five successful penalties against Toulon . English referee Wayne Barnes became the pantomime villain of the home supporters for repeatedly penalising their idols, but he had every right to on several occasions, particularly when Xavier Chiocci, the Toulon loosehead prop, was being dismantled by Ireland tighthead Mike Ross in the scrum. As an occasion, this was several notches below the blood-and-thunder epic between Clermont and Saracens in St Etienne 24 hours earlier. Clermont\u2019s \u2018Yellow Army\u2019 \u2013 or \u2018Jaunards\u2019 \u2013 created a raucous, partisan atmosphere which wasn\u2019t matched here by the Toulon hordes. There was a healthy crowd in excess of 35,000, but that was a long way short of capacity and the noise was often restricted to boos for the officials. Even the Mexican Waves late on were half-hearted. Leinster blindside Jordi Murphy does brilliantly to get up and disrupt a Toulon lineout . Still, it was not all grim. Steffon Armitage made his trademark breakdown impact after coming on as a replacement and Halfpenny\u2019s class stood out throughout \u2013 not just as a goal-kicker but, crucially, in the way he handled the aerial onslaught with aplomb. The Wales idol had landed four penalties in normal time but saved his best for the end of the first half of extra-time \u2013 just before Habana\u2019s try \u2013 when he struck from halfway, with inches to spare. Afterwards, he reflected on the prospect of a first appearance in Europe\u2019s elite final, saying: \u2018It\u2019s what I grew up dreaming about. Toulon No 8\u00a0Chris Masoe makes a strong run as Leinster scrum half Isaac Boss tries to make the tackle . \u2018I grew up watching European Cup Finals and you work hard day-in, day-out to be involved in big games like that. For me, coming to Toulon with the success they\u2019 ve achieved and the ambition they have, I wanted to be part of that. I was fortunate enough to be given the opportunity.\u2019 Toulon were fortunate that he took his opportunities on Sunday. It meant that their shortcomings were not critically exposed and they will surely rouse themselves to far greater heights for the final. Their showdown with Clermont will shake Twickenham to its foundations. These twin French giants are the dominant forces of the era - the rest of Europe are chasing their shadows. Toulon full back Leigh Halfpenny makes no mistake from the kicking tee after Leinster infringed .",

        "article": "Amazing images of a typhoon heading for the Philippines have been snapped from orbit by two astronauts. Typhoon Maysak was initially a top-rated category 5 typhoon, causing troops in the Philippines to be put on alert today. And residents and toursists along the eastern coast have been warned that it will hit land some time in the next 72 hours. This image taken Tuesday 31 March 31 shows Typhoon Maysak taken by astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti from the International Space Station. The Pacific Daily News newspaper in Guam reports the storm was upgraded Tuesday to a super typhoon with winds of 150mph . As it moved over the Pacific Ocean, the storm generated winds of more than 140mph (225km/h). It is expected to weaken once it hits the central or northern parts of the main Philippine island of Luzon on Saturday or Sunday. 'Commands respect even from #space: we just flew over typhoon #Maysak,' Esa astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti said in a tweet. And fellow astronaut Terry Virts, of Nasa, said: 'Looking down into the eye - by far the widest one I've seen. It seemed like a black hole from a Sci-Fi movie #Maysak.' Accuweather.com reported that the storn was one of the strongest cyclones in history during the months of January, February and March. Although it is expected to weaken slightly, it will still pose a significant threat to islands in its past. It first developed into a tropical storm last Friday, and now the full power of a super typhoon can be seen in the images. The steep walls of cloud drop into the eye of the storm, and more than 10 inches (250mm) of rain have been reported under the storm. Nasa astronaut Terry Virts captured the eye of typhoon Maysak early in the morning with the shadow being cast deep into the vortex. The storm was moving west-northwest at 15mph . The eyewall of Super Typhoon Maysak is seen as it heads west-northwestward through the western Pacific Ocean, northwest of Yap Island, in this infrared image taken by the Suomi NPP satellite's VIIRS instrument 1 April 2015. The storm has maintained its 15 nautical mile diameter eye, but is weakening slightly as dry air encroaches from the southern periphery, according to Noaa . This map from Accuweather shows the path of super typhoon Maysak over the next few days . This image was taken yesterday by astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti from the International Space Station.  Officials say super Typhoon Maysak is expected to significantly weaken before reaching the Philippines around Sunday . 'The eye of #Maysak typhoon really stands out early in the morning with the shadow being cast deep into the vortex,' said Terry Virts . 'This is very strong and it will maintain its strength as it nears, although we expect that the typhoon will weaken,' Esperanza Cayanan, an officer at the weather bureau, said in a televised briefing. 'But this will still be typhoon intensity so it will bring strong winds when it makes landfall on the eastern coast. British-based Tropical Storm Risk said Maysak would likely weaken to a category 2 typhoon, with maximum winds of up to 110mph (175km/h), when it hits land. The typhoon could damage rice and corn crops in central and northern areas of the Philippines, although damage is likely to be minimal because the major harvest of the national staple rice was finished around February. Super Typhoon Maysak is seen tracking west-northwestward through the western Pacific Ocean, northwest of Yap Island in this image taken by the Suomi NPP satellite's VIIRS instrument around 04:25GMT (00:25 ET) 1 April . 'Commands respect even from #space: we just flew over typhoon #Maysak,' Esa astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti said in a tweet . Alexander Pama, executive director of the national disaster agency, said the biggest challenge for authorities would be keeping foreign and Filipino tourists travelling to northern provinces for the weekend safe when Maysak makes landfall. Thousands of Filipinos have already begun travelling to the provinces and popular tourist spots before the Easter weekend. Maysak is not expected to make landfall where another category 5 typhoon, Haiyan, struck more than a year ago, leaving nearly 8000 dead or missing. The storm is expected to dissipate shortly after it leaves the Philippines.",

        "article": "Tottenham are considering a state-of-the-art stadium with a retractable pitch that enables them to become the home of a new NFL London franchise. The bold design of the new \u00a3400million stadium, due to be completed for the start of the 2018-19 season, could involve a \u2018slide-out\u2019 grass football pitch with an NFL-style synthetic surface housed underneath. The option of extra-large changing rooms, to accommodate NFL squad sizes that can amount to as many as 70 players at a game, is also being explored by architects. Tottenham are considering sharing their new \u00a3400m stadium with an NFL franchise . A spokesman for the north London club did not rule out the possibility this week, confirming that they are \u2018looking at options\u2019 in order to \u2018future-proof the design\u2019. The NFL is said to be within five years of having a permanent franchise in London. Indeed officials will be testing logistics when they stage their three games at Wembley this autumn, with teams looking at how quickly they can have their players back in the USA and ready to play again. The clash between the Buffalo Bills and Jacksonville Jaguars on October 25 will kick-off at 1.30pm while the New York Jets vs Miami Dolphins game on October 4 and Detroit Lions vs Kansas City Chiefs contest on November 1 will both begin at 2.30pm. As well as allowing the NFL to experiment with a live game on TV at breakfast time in the States (9.30am Eastern time), teams are able to take advantage of the time difference and be home on American soil by Sunday night. Tottenham's new state-of-the-art stadium is due to be ready in time for the 2018-19 season . Spurs' new 65,000 capacity stadium could be better suited to the NFL than the 90,000-seat Wembley . If Tottenham press ahead with the proposed stadium design and secure the NFL franchise it would represent a significant blow to the FA, who also see the NFL as a potentially lucrative partner for Wembley, their \u00a3757m stadium. But the NFL are keeping their options open at this stage in the knowledge that a new London stadium designed with American football requirements in mind would be hugely advantageous. Even the proposed capacity of 65,000 for the new White Hart Lane is a more realistic target than 90,000 seats which Wembley boasts. Wembley does have the iconic status that the NFL finds attractive but there are other issues with the national stadium. Not least the fact that they have to leave the lowest 5,000 seats empty so that the view of spectators is not restricted by the mass of huge bodies on the touchline. The modern NFL stadiums make sight-lines for spectators a priority and the new White Hart Lane could overcome the problem that is experienced at Wembley by having the artificial pitch at a significantly lower level beneath the moveable grass pitch. Wembley has hosted NFL regular-season matches since the International Series began in 2007 . Detroit Lions' clash with Atlanta Falcons kicked off early, as will all three games at Wembley later this year . Retractable grass pitches are nothing new in modern stadia design. England have played on two: at Gelsenkirchen in Germany during the 2006 World Cup and in the Sapporo Dome in Japan four years earlier. The Gelredome in Holland also has a retractable pitch, as does the University of Phoenix Stadium that hosted this year\u2019s Super Bowl. The advantage for these stadiums is the ability to grow the grass in a more natural environment, outside, away from the shadows of the stands while also having the capacity to stage different events without damaging the playing surface. A feat of modern engineering, a pitch can be moved outside the stadium in less than four hours. A spokesman for Tottenham said: \u2018The club has always seen the new stadium as being at the heart of the regeneration of the area and it is important, therefore, to look at how we future-proof the design, as well as increasing the functionality of the stadium, whilst being conscious of community uses. At this stage it is about looking at options but nothing more.\u2019",

        "article": "All eyes were on John Terry this afternoon as he made the short trip across London to face QPR in the west London derby. Loftus Road was the place where the Chelsea skipper racially abused then QPR defender Anton Ferdinand in October 2011. Ferdinand's brother Rio was injured for Sunday's match. Terry, who has been a crucial part of Jose Mourinho's Premier League title bid this season, played the full 90 minutes however as Chelsea scraped a 1-0 win, but how did he get on... John Terry (centre) celebrates at the final whistle with Didier Drogba (left) and Branislav Ivanovic . Reception . There was a hostile introduction for Terry as the teams lined up, before a cacophony of boos rang out around the ground as he touched the ball in the opening minute. There was, however, no noticeable reaction from any of Chris Ramsey's players until Charlie Austin made himself known to the centre-back late in the first half with a robust challenge. Terry experienced a hostile atmosphere at Loftus Road, but put in a good display at the back for Chelsea . Temperament . It was a moment to cherish for the QPR fans as Austin responded to an arm across the chest by shoving Terry to the ground off the ball. The Chelsea skipper momentarily lost his cool and berated the assistant referee to the delight of the crowd. His battle with the striker continued into the second half, with the pair taken aside for a word after squaring up to each other but it was Terry who had the last laugh as Cesc Fabregas' late equaliser sealed three points. The Chelsea captain rises above Bobby Zamora to head the ball away as he dominated at the back . Performance . The former England captain was rarely troubled by Bobby Zamora and Charlie Austin. Although the pair were prominent throughout, a lack of pace meant Terry and partner Gary Cahill were able to deal with everything thrown at them even though they were bailed out by Thibaut Cortouis at times. There was a nervy moment in the first half when a long ball over the top caught out the 34-year-old, and he was lucky his misjudged touch didn't cost the side as Cahill covered, but it was a fairly comfortable day for the defender. The Chelsea captain was made to stretch occasionally, but he and Gary Cahil dealt with QPR's threat well . Conduct . Despite an obvious attempt from Austin to get under the skin of Terry, he largely ignored the attention surrounding him and focused solely on leading his side to an important win while handling the occasion with maturity. There were wild celebrations from Terry at the final whistle as he responded to the constant jeers. Terry's combative encounter with Charlie Austin attracted the attention of referee Andre Marriner .",

        "article": "Laura Robson put her injury frustrations to one side over the weekend by heading to Tortuga, a country music festival in Florida. The 21-year-old shared a photo on Instagram of her soaking up the sun with two friends and captioned the image 'Country music is the best music #tortuga.' In recent weeks, Robson has been stepping up her attempts at getting back on the tennis court after a lengthy absence. Laura Robson (centre) shared a picture on Instagram of her at Tortuga festival with two friends . Robson's last appearance came in the 2014 Australian Open first round where she lost in straight sets . Robson (left) had to wear a protective cast last year but tweeted a picture back on the court last month . Her last appearance was over a year ago, in the first round of the 2014 Australian Open, where she was swept aside in straight sets by Kirtsen Flipkens and she has not played since due to a left wrist problem. She had tendon surgery  and is now nearing a return, although she withdrew from a qualifying event for the Miami Open last month and also removed her name from a WTA Tour event in Bogota later in April. It appears her next target with be the French Open, with the first round starting on Sunday, May 24. Should she make it out on the clay at Roland Garros, it will end a 16-month absence from the court that has left one of Britain's brightest hopes in women's tennis without a world ranking. She has been practising in the United States, in Tampa, as she aims to build up form and fitness. A previous Instagram post on March 26, of her doing a handstand on a tennis court to show off her new shoes, showed supporters she was back training and the strength in her wrist was returning. Her manager, Max Eisenbud, gave an update on her progress at the end of March and sounded cautiously optimistic about how Robson is improving. Robson is now said to be nearing a return and is  targeting the French Open in May . The 21-year-old Robson also missed out on Wimbledon last year but could be in line to play in 2015 . 'I\u2019m happy with the way it\u2019s been going and she\u2019s been hitting the ball great in practice,' Eisenbud said. 'It\u2019s a question of waiting until the coaches think she can play five matches in a week. 'It\u2019s all about when she is ready to compete. We don\u2019t want to put her in a situation where she can\u2019t play a full tournament.'",

Joselyn Alejandra Ni\u00f1o is believed to have been killed, dismembered and stuffed in a beer cooler just over the Mexican border last Sunday. She achieved notoriety in January when a picture of her grasping a modified M4 assault rifle with an innocent smile on her face began circulating on social media. Scroll down for video . Joselyn Alejandra Ni\u00f1o is believed to have been found stuffed in a beer cooler just over the Mexican border last Sunday. She gained notoriety in January when this picture began circulating online . The woman, who looks like she is in her late teens or early 20s, began operating under the name Rio Bravo. Cutting a slim physique and an almost innocent smile, she also donned a Kevlar jacket beneath a gold necklace. In the comments next to the striking image, people urged her to sell the gun and buy another TV while others prayed for her. A picture of her body laying next to a dead man and another woman was taken before another image was posted showing her dismembered body in the cooler. A tattoo saying 'Nino', the same as the one seen on her right forearm, is also seen in the cooler. Alongside the photo was a message warning people to 'keep sending theses f****** a*** holes', insisting they will meet the same fate. Her two predecessors also ran into bad luck during confrontations with law enforcement. The first of the three 'Skinny Girls' was Veronica Mireya Moreno. According to The Daily Beast she started out as a police officer and became a hero when she was wounded during a shootout. The first of the three 'Skinny Girls' was Veronica Mireya Moreno. She was arrested driving a stolen car with a revolver and six cellphones inside and was accused of being complicit in a number of murders and drug deals in 2011 . On Saturday violence erupted on the U.S border after security forces arrested one of the area's most influential drug dealers . She is then alleged to have signed with the Los Zetas cartel and was arrested in 2011 while driving a stolen car - with a revolver and six cellphones inside. She was subsequently arrested and charged with being complicit in a number of murders and drug deals. Months later Nancy Manriquez Quintanar was said to have taken part in a string of slayings, mainly from competing cartels. More than 100,000 people have died in gang-related violence in Mexico over the past eight years.

For the same price as the 1997 timepiece, Apple fans could pre-order five of the cheapest Apple Watch Sport, which cost \u00a3299 in the UK and still have some change. An analogue promotional watch from Apple (pictured) with a blue bezel, rubber strap and colourful hands, is listed on the internet auction site with a \u2018buy it now\u2019 price of $2,499.99 (\u00a31,707.47) plus postage . However, it is still cheaper than the Apple Watch Edition, which costs upwards of \u00a38,000 ($10,000). The seller, called \u2018theappleipodbay\u2019 calls the watch, which was made by Quartz and released to promote Apple\u2019s Mac Operating system, a \u2018rare collector item\u2019. \u2018The watch was part of an Apple promo and has been preserved from the 1990s,' the seller wrote on their eBay page. \u2018A new battery has been installed and the watch is new, never used or worn.\u2019 It is still in its original box and the seller claims to have two to offload, with 10 days to go. The seller, called \u2018theappleipodbay\u2019 calls the watch, which was released to promote Apple\u2019s Mac Operating system, a \u2018rare collector item. This image shows the listing on the auction website . Unlike Apple\u2019s new Watch, the vintage model has a circular screen, which has no digital capabilities and shows the company\u2019s old rainbow hue logo. Three versions of Apple's watch (pictured) are available to pre-order online and almost one million orders are thought to have been taken in the US on the first day alone . 'Will the Apple Watch change your life? Well, possibly more than many realise until they start using it. 'After a day or two with the watch, a strange thing happened - I completely stopped checking my phone. 'While Apple may be the firm that really creates phone addiction, meaning we are constantly checking our handsets, with the Apple Watch it may have cured it. 'Apple undoubtedly has another hit on its hands with the watch. 'As more and more apps appear, and developers actually get to spend time with it, I fully expect it be used in ways we can't even imagine now. 'Much like the iPhone, apps could propel this to become a new computing platform - and even with the features it already has, the Apple watch is the most elegant way to communicate digitally.' Unlike Apple\u2019s new smart watch, the vintage model has a circular screen, which has no digital capabilities and shows the company\u2019s old rainbow hue logo. The International Business Times reported that the watch is almost 50 times more valuable \u2013 according to its seller \u2013 than it was a year ago, thanks to the launch of the new Apple Watch. It\u2019s not known how many of the vintage watches Apple had made at the time, or how many still exist, but one sold on eBay in Match last year for $54 (\u00a337). At the time of writing, two more of the watch model are listed online for $1,000 (\u00a3679) and $750 (\u00a3510), but neither have fetched that amount of money, suggesting sellers may just be trying their luck. It's thought that Apple sold almost one million Apple Watches in the US alone on the first day that the device could be pre-ordered. It goes on sale in shops in nine countries on April 24. Apple has not confirmed any sales figures, but Tim Cook, interviewed on cable television channel CNBC, said initial orders were 'great.' Slice Intelligence measured digital commerce by tracking consumer receipts to come up with its number of 957,000 American shoppers ordering Apple Watches on the first day that they could do so. Those ordering an Apple Watch Sport, the cheapest version, spent $382.83 per watch and those ordering the Apple Watch spent $707.04. 'As expected, most consumers \u2013 62 percent \u2013 purchased the less-expensive Sport model,' said Jaimee Minney of Slice. The data also showed that most consumers opted for the larger 42 mm case. Apple predicted on Thursday that demand would exceed supply at product launch. Soon after online pre-orders opened on Friday, Apple's website listed shipping times in June for some models of the watch and four to six weeks for others. There was immediately brisk bidding on eBay for confirmed orders for watches, with hundreds of sellers looking to make a few hundred or even thousand dollars by passing on their watches, once received. \u2018The watch was part of an Apple promo and has been preserved from the 1990s,' the seller wrote.

        "article": "Jonny Howson made a triumphant return to Elland Road to nudge Norwich one step closer to the Premier League. An academy product and Leeds\u2019 youngest captain since Billy Bremner before moving to Carrow Road for \u00a32million in January 2012, Howson marked his first game back at his old club by making the breakthrough in the 57th minute to keep Alex Neil\u2019s side in the automatic promotion places. The 26-year-old had already endured taunts of \u2018cheat\u2019 from the home fans after winning a first-half penalty when he was bundled over by current Leeds skipper Liam Cooper. Jonny Howson (8) refuses to celebrate after putting Norwich ahead early in the second half . The midfielder smashed home to put his side in control and continue their automatic promotion charge . Graham Dorrans hammered his spot-kick against the underside of the ball and then wasted another opportunity moments later, although he made amends with Norwich\u2019s second goal in injury-time. Howson struck when Nathan Redmond poked the ball across to him just inside the box, guiding it with the outside of his right foot beyond a despairing Marco Silvestri and inside the far post. If his celebration was a little muted, the same could not be said for Neil and his staff on the touchline as they sensed a fifth straight win. Graham Dorrans (right) sealed the tie with a late goal and made up for his late penalty miss . Leeds XI: Silvestri 6; Wootton 6, Bamba 6.5, Cooper 5.5, Byram 6 (Montenegro 85); Ngoyi 6; Taylor 5 (Antenucci 71, 6), Murphy 6, Mowatt 7, Berardi 6; Sharp 7.

Star man: Jonny Howson . \u2018I think every passing game now is a massive moment,\u2019 said the Norwich boss. \u2018I told the players at half-time that we had three-and-a-half games left. The next 45 minutes could be the turning point of the season to get us over the line or it could cost us. \u2018Jonny is a model professional. I know Leeds mean a lot to him but ultimately he\u2019s done his job tonight (Tuesday).\u2019 It still needed a magnificent block by Russell Martin to deny Scott Wootton and John Ruddy\u2019s flying save from Alex Mowatt to preserve Norwich\u2019s lead before Dorrans made sure of victory, burying his shot from 15 yards after a fine run and cutback from Cameron Jerome. Leeds head coach Neil Redfearn said: \u2018The ball was a yard out of play so it\u2019s a bit harsh on us.\u2019 With Norwich, Bournemouth and Middlesbrough all winning, the pressure is now on Watford to do the same when they visit Nottingham Forest on Wednesday night. It also raises the stakes even higher when Norwich entertain Middlesbrough at Carrow Road on Friday battling for a \u00a3120m ticket to the top-flight. Dorrans (centre) smashed a first half penalty against the crossbar but later spared his blushes . Luke Murphy (left) attempts to tackle Nathan Redmond during the first half in the Championship clash . \u2018Each game gets bigger and bigger, and for us and Middlesbrough, it won\u2019t get much bigger than this game on Friday night,\u2019 said Neil, who kept his players in the north to prepare for this game after they snatched an injury-time winner at Bolton on Saturday. \u2018My mindset before the game is that we do our job, we don\u2019t pay attention to others. With all three of us winning tonight, Watford have got a job to do tomorrow but that\u2019s for them to worry about. \u2018We\u2019ve worked so hard to get here. It\u2019s not easy. The games are coming thick and fast, and mentally it\u2019s tough. But we\u2019re well up for the challenge, this is what you\u2019re in football for. \u2018Looking at Bolton and Leeds, on paper, they were two extremely difficult games and the fact we\u2019ve managed to pick up six points says a huge amount about the character in the squad.\u2019 Murphy fires a free-kick into the Norwich wall as Leeds lost their fourth game in five in the Championship .",

        "article": "It is not the first advertising billboard in which a company has used the image of a svelte, bikini-clad model to sell its wares and it probably won\u2019t be the last. But something about this poster for Protein World diet supplements has struck a collective raw nerve. The company is facing a massive backlash over its billboard campaign \u2014 including vandalised posters, a petition, a protest rally and even a bomb threat. Scroll down for video . Protein World's billboard campaign advertising diet supplements features a svelte bikini-clad model asking 'Are you beach body ready?' Campaigners launched a scathing attack on the protein supplement company after the advert \u2014 which features a toned model posing with the slogan \u2018Are you beach body ready?\u2019 \u2014 began appearing on the London Underground three weeks ago. The \u2018body shaming\u2019 campaign has seen many of its posters defaced with feminist slogans, more than 50,000 people sign a petition to have them removed and a demonstration planned for this weekend in protest. But yesterday the company\u2019s marketing boss claimed the firm is \u2018just trying to make the nation healthier\u2019. Richard Staveley, Protein World\u2019s head of global marketing, added: \u2018It\u2019s been a brilliant campaign for us and I don\u2019t see us changing anything dramatically any time soon.\u2019 Richard Staveley, Protein World\u2019s head of global marketing revealed that the company has received bomb threats in the wake of the campaign but said it had been 'brilliant' and that he didn't see the company changing . On ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain yesterday, presenter Susanna Reid, 44, admitted that, like many women, she finds the advert \u2018a little bit anxiety-inducing' On ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain yesterday, presenter Susanna Reid, 44, admitted that, like many women, she finds the advert \u2018a little bit anxiety-inducing\u2019. And the Advertising Standards Authority confirmed it had received 277 complaints, with many commenting that \u2018the advert is offensive, irresponsible and harmful because it promotes an unhealthy body image\u2019. Posters have been vandalised with feminist messages such as \u2018Your body is not a commodity\u2019. Photographs of the amended signs have gone viral online. Despite the controversy, earlier in the week the company announced on Twitter it had made sales of \u00a31 million and attracted 20,000 new customers in just four days following the advert\u2019s release. Protein World has taken a strong stance on social media during the furore and has posted blunt replies to complaints on Twitter, including \u2018why make your insecurities our problem\u2019 and \u2018grow up\u2019. The company\u2019s CEO and founder, Arjun Seth, has even branded the people defacing his adverts \u2018terrorists\u2019, \u2018irrational and extremist\u2019. But the poster has struck a collective raw nerve with many of the billboards being vandalised with people writing messages reinforcing that every 'body' of any shape, size and age is ready for the beach - \u00a0such as #eachbodysready . Pictured of the defaced posters have appeared on Facebook, such as this which someone had covered with a note which reads: '1 You're body is fine just as it is. 2 Whatever it looks like your body is not a commodity #Everybody's ready #Everyday sexism' Speaking on Good Morning Britain, Mr Staveley said his company had received a series of threats, including one to bomb its head office. He said: \u2018First, we\u2019ve been inundated, as you\u2019ve probably seen from our Twitter feed and Facebook, of people defacing adverts, ripping them down and climbing over rail tracks to graffiti them. \u2018That\u2019s criminal behaviour. I think that\u2019s quite extreme behaviour. \u2018We\u2019ve actually had threats on our head office, physical, violent threats. We had a bomb threat.\u2019 More than 52,300 people have signed a petition demanding the adverts are removed. Demonstrators plan to congregate at London\u2019s Hyde Park on Saturday for a protest dubbed \u2018Taking back the beach\u2019. On a Facebook page calling on people to attend the demonstration, a post reads: \u2018The idea that your body should be hidden away if it doesn\u2019t meet these bizarrely specific requirements . . . I\u2019m over it.\u2019 The company is facing a massive backlash over its billboard campaign \u2014 including vandalised posters, a petition, a protest rally and even a bomb threat . More than 50,000 people have already signed a petition to have them removed and a demonstration planned for this weekend in protest . When Miss Reid asked Mr Staveley about claims the posters make women feel anxious, he replied: \u2018We\u2019re advertising our weight-loss collection. That\u2019s what millions of people are aspiring to do in time for their summer holiday \u2014 to lose a bit of weight, feel a bit healthier and get fitter. It\u2019s not a new concept.\u2019 He confirmed the model in the picture, Australian Renee Somerfield, 23, had achieved her enviable physique using Protein World products, and denied the image had been retouched or altered. A spokesman for Transport for London said the adverts will be taken down from today \u2014 not because of the controversy, but because they have \u2018come to the end of their natural three-week advertising lifespan\u2019. Sioned Quirke, a specialist dietitian based in South Wales, said: \u2018Some people do find that increasing their protein intake can aid weight loss. \u2018But generally, taking a supplement or diet pill will not do all the work for you. \u2018Also, these kinds of products are not regulated or monitored, so you can never be 100 per cent sure what is actually in them.\u2019 Online fitness store Protein World, who claim that the image is entirely unPhotoshopped, have been actively engaging in the furore on social media, strongly defending their campaign with some biting responses to aggrieved Tweeters .",

        "article": "(CNN)Five young Chinese feminists, whose detention has provoked an international outcry, may face up to five years in prison over their campaign for gender equality. The women were among detained on March 6 and March 7 in three Chinese cities -- Beijing, Guangzhou and Hangzhou -- shortly before events they had planned for International Women's Day on March 8. Wang Qiushi, the lawyer for one of the women, Wei Tingting, said police had recommended on April 6 that prosecutors press charges of \"assembling a crowd to disturb public order.\" Wang told CNN that prosecutors had to decide whether to pursue the charges within seven days of the submission -- by Monday. \"We hope that the prosecutors will not approve a formal arrest warrant, following the laws and standing up to pressure,\" he said. \"But nobody knows what to expect till Monday; we can do nothing but wait.\" The five were initially held on suspicion of \"picking quarrels and provoking trouble.\" Wang said he didn't know why the charge against the women changed. \"Neither should constitute a crime,\" he said. Campaign group Amnesty International said the new charge was less serious but still carried a maximum jail term of five years. \"The women were doing nothing wrong, nothing illegal. They were simply calling for an end to sexual harassment,\" William Nee, China researcher at Amnesty International told CNN. \"Everything they were doing was in line with China's own laws and policies.\" Wang said that Wei had been subject to lengthy cross examinations during her detention but was well the last time they met on March 31. Two of the women are said to be in poor health. He added that the charges relate both to the activities the women planned for International Women's Day and earlier campaigns against domestic violence and for more public toilets for women. The five -- who are members of China's Women's Rights Action Group -- had planned to hand out stickers printed with slogans saying \"stop sexual harassment, let us stay safe\" and \"go police, go arrest those who committed sexual harassment!\" on women's day. The detention of Wei, along with Wu Rongrong, Li Tingting, Wang Man and Zheng Churan has drawn harsh criticism from the international community. Protests have taken place in several cities, including Hong Kong, that urge Chinese officials to \"free the five.\" A social media campaign also uses the phrase as a hashtag. On Monday, Hillary Clinton, former U.S. secretary of state, tweeted that the activists' detention was \"inexcusable.\" Her comment drew a rebuke from Chinese authorities, who said public figures should respect China's sovereignty and independence. Maya Wang, China researcher at Human Rights Watch, said the activists were best known for their \"performance art\" style protests -- occupying public toilets to highlight long lines at women's restrooms, donning blood-spattered wedding gowns to protest domestic violence and shaving their heads to protest against barriers to higher education for women. \"These activists epitomize the spirit of the times. They are young, confident, ready to challenge established norms,\" Wang said. As China prepares to mark the anniversary of landmark UN Fourth World Conference on Women in September, it will be hard for authorities to justify detaining the activists, she added.",

They will inspire their team-mates with their discipline, character and application, just as Mike Atherton inspired me with the way he batted to save a Test in Johannesburg and in his famous battle with Allan Donald at Trent Bridge. This is an era in which West Indies are losing players to the easier option of the Indian Premier League and it is understandable because of the money that can be made there. Why shouldn\u2019t they cash in? Marlon Samuels (right)  celebrates reaching his century for West Indies in second Test . But Samuels has taken the difficult road. It is all well and good going off and having a bit of a hit and giggle but he will take a lot more satisfaction from the way he has taken on the moving ball in a demanding Test match. These are the types of innings you remember when you retire. He will remember his duel with Ben Stokes, the way he saw off a newish ball and how he took the attack to England on the first evening. He did finally fall to Jimmy Anderson after a loose shot but by that time Samuels had grafted his way to 103. That is what you get in Test cricket. This is far harder than going off towards the end of your career and enjoying an IPL sunset. I never played in an easy Test. There is no easy option during five hard-fought days and that\u2019s why this game gives you far more satisfaction than you will ever get over 50 or 20 overs. It gets me down to hear people saying \u2018wasn\u2019t Antigua boring\u2019 or \u2018these pitches are just too dead and the cricket is slow\u2019. Just give this time. The Test England won in the dark of Karachi was remembered for years because it was the ultimate conclusion to three hard Tests. The same could happen here. I can see a lot of our England side of 2000 in this West Indies team. We could not become a winning side straight away. West Indies batsman Samuels grafted his way to 103 against England in the second Test . We had to stay in games, instil a bit of pride and discipline before we could think about being positive and that\u2019s what Simmons is trying to do here. The first step is to take Tests into five days and once that is achieved then West Indies can think about moving on and hopefully keeping their best players. The seven days we have had so far in this series may not have satisfied those who prefer their gratification instant but I have enjoyed it. This is not to denigrate Twenty20 or what we saw at the World Cup but there is something fulfilling about seeing a match go to the fifth day as in Antigua, with England bowling 130 overs and trying to find different ways to take 10 wickets. We live in a modern world of instant news where Test cricket seems something of a throwback but there is still great satisfaction to be taken from a slow burner. Ben Stokes was admonished by umpire Steve Davis following clash with Samuels . I find the mental side of Test cricket to be unparalleled. To be Jonathan Trott, for instance, getting a duck in his first innings after waiting to get back in for 18 months. Then he has to spend the best part of two days fielding and sweating on a pair. You can\u2019t replicate that in any other form of the game. Someone like Alastair Cook has to tackle a technical issue, having been found out by opponents, and has the mental battle to overcome it. There is the physical challenge of a bowling attack spending all that time in the heat trying to bowl a side out and then having to go through it all again. In Twenty20 you can have a bit of a slog, edge through the slips for four to get you off and running and then get caught on the boundary which is supposed to happen in the short game. I thoroughly enjoy the different attractions of limited-overs cricket. But Test cricket is what players will be remembered for. Even in the modern world.",

        "article": "A mother-of-one crippled by her 30-year phobia of snakes was cured live on TV today in an astonishing ten minutes. Before today, Dawn Williamson, 39 and based in Scotland, could not even confront a plastic snake without panicking, and would obsessively check her toilet for the reptiles every day. But viewers of ITV1\u2019s This Morning were amazed as therapists Nik and Eva Speakman broke down Dawn\u2019s phobia with their no-nonsense approach, which involved 'proving' to Dawn that her fear was irrational. Trimuph: Dawn Williamson (centre), 39, was\u00a0cured of her crippling snake phobia live on TV today by therapists Nik and Eva Speakman in an astonishing ten minutes . At the beginning of the show, Dawn - who was hooked up to a heart monitor throughout - broke down in tears at the mere sight of a plastic snake, which sent her heart rate soaring. By the end of the show she was able to touch a real-life 9ft Burmese python as it stretched out across her lap, leaving hosts Philip Schofield and Amanda Holden gob-smacked. 'It\u2019s a miracle,' Amanda said. 'The results have been absolutely extraordinary.' Dawn, who is now able to take her seven-year-old daughter on a dream holiday to Florida later this year thanks to her treatment, said: 'All my life I\u2019ve been terrified of snakes. 'But to sit down with one on my knee is just unbelievable.' The Speakmans have now helped 60 people overcome there fears and phobias live on TV, from balloons and snowmen, to frogs and spiders. But today\u2019s was the first time viewers have been able to see the process in action. Lifelong phobia: Dawn had been petrified of snakes ever since she watched B-movie Venom when she was seven years old . Therapy: When presented with a tray of plastic snakes (pictured) she shook with fear and broke down in tears . Nik said: 'Usually we\u2019ll go into another room away from the cameras, and spend a bit more time with the person and it can take a fair amount of time. 'But this time we spent just ten minutes going through it with Dawn, so viewers can see how we did it. It was very special as Dawn was the 60th person we\u2019ve treated. We were thrilled at the result.' The Speakmans had never met Dawn, from Scotland until five minutes before the show and knew nothing about her phobia until they saw a VT recorded in Dawn\u2019s home, showing how her life was being blighted by her phobia, known as ophidiophobia. Dawn had been petrified of snakes ever since she watched B-movie Venom when she was seven years old, she explained. 'If I see a snake on TV, I immediately have to get my feet up, the TV turned over. Then I\u2019ll go to bed that night I\u2019ll be checking under the covers. 'I also check in the wardrobe where we keep all the shoes because you just never know, they could be hiding in there. I\u2019ll check in my boots, give them a wee shake, make sure there\u2019s nothing in there.' Obsessive: Dawn used to compulsively check her home for snakes, and would frequently shake her boots to make sure they weren't hiding any . Philip asked her: 'Do you find it irrational? I don\u2019t know when a snake was last found in a loo in Scotland.' Dawn replied: 'Yes. But I read a story in a newspaper once that someone had found a pet snake in the toilet, so ever since then I\u2019ve checked.' Dawn was then asked by Philip to scribble down the word snake on a piece of paper - sending her heart rate soaring from 90 to over 130. She was also shown clips of Carl Fogerty with a snake slithering over him in the I\u2019m A Celebrity jungle, as well as having to confront a tray of plastic toy snakes which made Dawn shake with fear and break down in tears. Eva continued the session by getting Dawn to concede that her fear of snakes was indeed irrational, before pointing out the irony that in hunting for snakes around the house, she was seeking out her fear. Irrational? Dawn also used to check under the loo seat every time she was about to use it, despite living in Scotland, which is not known for it's teeming serpent population . 'What\u2019s happened is that you watched a film when you were seven years old and you reacted and created a schema,' Eva explained. 'The reason you now react irrationally is because you\u2019re actually consulting a seven-year-old on how to react when you see a snake.' Dawn was then asked to talk about Venom, the horror movie which ignited her fear of snakes in the first place, in which a snake kills everyone involved. Nik then asked: 'So just from that one event, watching that film you\u2019re frightened of snakes? 'You\u2019ve been scratched by your cat but you're not frightened of it. What\u2019s a snake ever done to you?' He added: 'You\u2019re frightened of something that\u2019s never hurt you, something that you\u2019ve never physically held, that you only saw in a film when you were seven years of age. Does that make sense? 'Essentially, for 30 years, you have victimised snakes for no reason at all.' Relief: After accepting that her fear of snakes was irrational, Dawn was able to touch a real-life 9ft Burmese python as it stretched out across her lap . Logic: Eva (right) explained that it was essential to their techniques that the person being treated can feel the difference and see the evidence for themselves that they have overcome their fear . The Speakmans then held up a series of pictures of snakes to test Dawn\u2019s reaction. To everyone's amazement she remained calm and said: 'I can look at it.' Nik remarked: 'This is the difference between seeing a snake through the eyes of a 30-odd year-old woman and not a seven-year-old child. You\u2019re looking confused right now. 'That\u2019s because you've spent 30 years believing something that essentially is not true.' Dawn was then presented with a tank of live snakes, and admitted that although 'bizarre', she was no longer has a phobia of them. At the end of the show, producers brought out a giant, 9ft-long Burmese python which laid across the laps of Dawn and The Speakman\u2019s, with Dawn stroking the python. Remarkably, her heart rate stayed below 100. 'I never thought I\u2019d be able to hold one,' she said. Eva explained that it was essential to their techniques that the person being treated can feel the difference and see the evidence for themselves that they have overcome their fear. She added: 'It\u2019s about proving to the person that their fears are completely irrational.'",

        "article": "An enormous diorama which shows the full extent of the Battle of Waterloo has gone on display to mark the 200th anniversary of the conflict. The model contains more than 30,000 figures, and illustrates all the key moments of the battle which allowed the Duke of Wellington to defeat Napoleon's forces. It was built in the 1970s, but fell into disrepair before being restored to its former glory just in time for the battle's bicentenary, which falls on June 18 of this year. Scroll down for video . Model: This diorama shows the full extent of the Battle of Waterloo, which took place almost exactly 200 years ago . General: Napoleon, pictured riding a white horse, is shown directing his troops in the unsuccessful attempt to defeat the British forces . Victor: Wellington, wearing a blue jacket with his right arm outstretched, won the battle and has been known as one of Britain's greatest generals ever since . Light-hearted: The diorama shows little vignettes such as a British soldier relieving himself against a tree . The 25sq/m model has 21,500 soldiers and 10,000 horses, illustrating not just the major military events of the battle but also a number of light-hearted vignettes. Despite the enormous scale of the diorama, the number of troops featured is just a third of the true number who were killed or wound in the battle - and less than 10 per cent of the total number who took part. It is on display at the Royal Green Jackets Museum in Winchester, where it will serve as the centrepiece for the commemoration of the Battle of Waterloo. The diorama was not intended as a snapshot of the battle at any one point, but instead it depicts five different key stages in the progress of the conflict. Crucial: One of the key moments depicted is the battle for Hougoumont, a fortress which was successfully defended by Wellington . Melee: The British forming a square in the face of attacks from Napoleon's troops . Charge: The Scots Greys making an intervention in the battle, whose 200th anniversary is this year . Indomitable: A farmer successfully defended his vegetable patch even as the battle raged all around him . Busted: Two British soldiers are depicted trying to sneak off with their regiment's entire ration of gin . The first is the Battle for Hougoumont, a castle successfully defended by Wellington, followed by the attempt by d'Erlon Corps to attack Wellington's centre, which was repelled by Lieutenant General Sir Thomas Picton. Next is the Charge of the Heavy Brigade, the Allied cavalry offensive that scattered the French infantry, then the unsuccessful French cavalry attacks on Wellington's centre and right flank. The final crucial moment depicted is the attack of the Imperial Guard, Napoleon's last desperate throw of the dice, which led to the guard being forced to retreat for the first time ever. Both the Duke of Wellington and Napoleon Bonaparte can be found on the model astride their horses directing the battle. There is also a grim depiction of Major General Sir William Ponsonby meeting his end - being speared by a group of French lancers. Grim: Major General William Ponsonby being cut down by a group of French lancers during the battle . Onslaught: French troops trying to break through the gates of Hougoumont, as the British guard the walls . Help: A wounded soldier being escorted off the battlefield by his wife, who was apparently acting as a camp nurse . Family: Women and children in the back of a cart on the edges of the Waterloo battlefield . Quagmire: Men, carts and horses get stuck in a muddy pit and try to haul their equipment out . Lighter moments include a Belgian farmer defending his prized vegetable patch while the battle rages around him, two English soldiers getting drunk on gin and an infantryman relieving himself against a tree. A large French fighter who was known as 'The Enforcer' can be seen trying to break down an English barricade with an axe. Museum curator Vere Hayes said: 'There are so many vignettes within the diorama. 'One of my favourites is the gardener at Hougoumont. He and his family meant to escape before the battle but left it too late. He is portrayed on the model protecting his cabbages. Many French attackers saw him during the battle and laughed at his actions. 'The 200th anniversary of Waterloo is a landmark commemoration of a decisive victory that brought peace to Europe after years of conflict. 'Whilst thousands will be making the trip to Belgium to participate in and witness re-enactments on the battlefield, we can bring the battlefield to Britain.' Late arrival: Von Blucher leading the Prussian troops onto the battlefield, in a decisive intervention . Repair: The diorama was in a poor condition before being restored ahead of the anniversary . Spruced up: These images show how the figures were covered in dust before their recent restoration . Conservation: Kelvin and Mary Thatcher used a vacuum cleaner to help remove the grime which had built up . Conservationists Kelvin and Mary Thatcher spent five months cleaning the figures on the diorama, and glued back together scores of severed limbs, lost swords and displaced cannonballs. Mr Hayes added: 'The diorama was made in the 1970s by Valhalla Models and acquired by the museum in the 1980s. But it never had a top put on it so has got extremely dusty over the years. 'Kelvin and Mary Thatcher took it apart in 16 sections and took four sections at a time back to their home in Norfolk where they cleaned each individual figure using an air hose and a vacuum cleaner. 'They have done a fantastic job and it is great to be able to see the incredible detail so clearly.' The Battle of Waterloo on June 18, 1815 stopped the advance of Napoleon across Europe and sent the great French emperor into exile for a second and final time. France's troops were defeated by a multi-national coalition, led by the British army under the command of the Duke of Wellington. The armies amassed near the town of Waterloo in modern-day Belgium, not far from the border with France, and it was the French who made the first move around 11am. The two sides clashed for 10 hours, with the British fending off repeated attacks from the French, until Marshal Bl\u00fccher arrived at the head of a Prussian army. This was the decisive intervention which finished Napoleon off, allowing Wellington to counter-attack and forcing the Frenchman to surrender. The battle forced Napoleon from the throne of France, leading to his exile on St Helena - but Wellington later admitted it was 'the nearest-run thing you ever saw in your life'. Despite the popular image of Waterloo as a heroic endeavour, it was also the scene of brutal slaughter as thousands of troops were killed, with the French bearing the brunt of the losses.",

The Alborz destroyer and Bushehr support vessel sailed from Bandar Abbas to the Gulf of Aden today with military bosses claiming the move is designed to protect Iranian shipping from piracy. It comes as Saudi Arabia continues to lead a bombing campaign to oust the Iran-allied Houthi movement which has taken most of Yemen and forced President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi to flee to Riyadh. Scroll down for video . Smoke billows from a Saudi-led airstrike on Sanaa, Yemen earlier today amid reports Iran has sent a navy destroyer and another vessel to the Gulf of Aden . Conflict: Yemeni supporters of the southern separatist movement fire towards Houthi rebels during clashes in the northern Dar Saad neighbourhood of the southern Yemeni city of Aden today . A Houthi fighter aims a weapon upwards as smoke rises from a building after a Saudi-led airstrike on a street in Sanaa, Yemen . Saudi Arabia and several Arab allies have imposed an air and naval blockade on Yemen in a two-week campaign that has been condemned by Iran, which has called for dialogue. The Iranian ships will patrol the Gulf of Aden, south ofYemen, and the Red Sea, Rear Admiral Habibollah Sayyari said in comments cited by Press TV . Meanwhile, Washington\u00a0deepened its involvement in the conflict as aid agencies scrambled to deliver help to civilians caught up in the campaign now heading into its third week. The Red Cross has warned of a 'catastrophic' situation in main southern city Aden where militia loyal to fugitive President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi have been holding out against Houthi Shiite rebels and their allies within the security forces. Gunfight: A man fires towards Houthi rebels. Eleven people were killed in Yemen's main southern city Aden overnight in clashes between rebels and forces loyal to fugitive President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi . Scores of people have been killed or wounded in the street fighting in the heart of the port city of Aden . Scores of people have been killed or wounded in the street fighting in the heart of the port city and aid agency Doctors Without Borders said it feared many more had been unable to reach hospitals. The main Shiite power Iran, which has strongly opposed the Saudi-led intervention, stepped up its efforts for a negotiated settlement with a visit to Saudi ally Pakistan by Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif. Islamabad has so far deflected appeals by Riyadh to join the coalition of nine - mainly Sunni - Arab countries intervening in Yemen, for fear of deepening sectarian divisions at home and across the Muslim world. US Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington was stepping up weapons deliveries and intelligence sharing in support of the Saudi-led coalition. 'Saudi Arabia is sending a strong message to the Houthis and their allies that they cannot overrun Yemen by force,' Blinken told reporters in the Saudi capital.

A girl runs for shelter during an air strike in Sanaa.\u00a0Saudi Arabia is leading a bombing campaign to oust the Iran-allied Houthi movement which has taken most of Yemen . 'In support of that effort we have expedited weapons deliveries,' he said after talks with Defence Minister Mohammed bin Salman and other Saudi officials. A US defence official told AFP that Washington was sending primarily precision-guided munitions. The coalition launched its air war on March 26 as the rebels and their allies closed on Hadi's last refuge Aden, prompting him to flee to neighbouring Saudi Arabia. Riyadh accuses Tehran of backing the rebels and has vowed to bomb them into surrender to prevent them establishing a pro-Iran state on its doorstep. But the rebels have powerful allies within the security forces who have remained loyal to longtime strongman Ali Abdullah Saleh, forced from power in 2012 after a year-long, Arab Spring-inspired uprising. Eight rebels and three loyalist militiamen were killed in clashes in Aden overnight, a military source said. Saudi-led warplanes also bombed rebel positions at the city's international airport and the huge Al-Anad air base to its north, another military source said.

Washington is stepping up weapons deliveries and intelligence sharing in support of the Saudi-led coalition . Al-Anad was a key monitoring post in Washington's longstanding drone war against Al-Qaeda until it withdrew its troops as fighting intensified last month. Last week, Al-Qaeda seized much of Hadramawt provincial capital Mukalla. On Tuesday, they attacked one of the last loyalist strongholds in the city. US Defence Secretary Ashton Carter acknowledged on Wednesday that the fighting in Yemen was complicating Washington's counter-terrorism efforts but vowed they would go on regardless. 'Obviously it's always easier to conduct CT ops when there is a stable government willing to cooperate,' he said. 'That circumstance now obviously doesn't exist in Yemen but that doesn't mean that we don't continue to take steps to protect ourselves. We have to do it in a different way, but we do and we are.'

As Iran's top diplomat prepared to visit, Pakistan said it would take its time deciding whether to accept the Saudi request to join the coalition.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has expressed support for the coalition without providing military forces, held talks in Tehran on Tuesday. 'We both think war and bloodshed must stop in this area immediately and a complete ceasefire must be established and the strikes must stop,' his Iranian counterpart Hassan Rouhani said after their meeting.

Dashcam footage shows the officers using their patrol vehicles to steer the one ton bison off the road and back to his farm near the city of Round Rock. As they beep their horns the animal, named Big Boy, continues to run along the sidewalk but at one point he veers in front of the police car and over to the other side of the road. Despite the detour, the buffalo made it home safely free of injury. His owner, 79-year-old\u00a0Joe Don Kotrla-Chipps, told Fox News that Big Boy has got into bad habits recently and has taken to jumping over his fence.

On the run: This is the moment police in Texas turn ranchers as they determinedly try and herd a buffalo . High-speed chase: Dashcam footage shows the officers using their patrol vehicles to steer the one ton bison off the road and back to his farm near the city of Round Rock . Lights, camera, action: As they beep their horns the animal, named Big Boy, continues to run along the sidewalk but at one point he veers in front of the police car and over to the other side of the road . As a result, Kotrla-Chipps is reportedly getting a higher boundary installed. In the meantime Big Boy, aged five, has been relocated to another patch of land. It was a local resident who reported the animal's break for freedom  after spotting him on the highway. Police said officers and an Animal Control unit responded  to a 'loose livestock' report and they were able to lure the bison to a secure area.

Authorities later highlighted the dangers of the situation. 'These animals are large, quick, and could do harm if encountered in the wrong circumstances,' they noted. Along with buffalo, Kotrla-Chipps keeps a range of animals on his ranch including pigs, dogs and peacock. Touching in the recent drama he concluded: '[Big Boy's] an exceptional buffalo.

The decision from U.S. District Judge Susan Dlott means right-wing groups are a step closer to being allowed to pursue a class-action lawsuit against the IRS. The agency has admitted playing political favorites with the tax code beginning in 2010, when it began applying extra scrutiny to groups with red-flag words like 'patriots' or 'tea party' in their names. While those organizations' applications were held up for years, liberal groups sailed through the process. Federal tax-exempt status is confered on groups that serve a public purpose, including issue advocacy, and allows them to promise tax deductions to their donors. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . F.U.I.R.S.: American conservatives were up in marks in 2013 after the IRS confirmed it had been slow-walking tax-exemption applications from tea party groups based on red-flag words in their names . Lois Lerner, the former IRS official at the heart of the tea party targeting scandal, ran the 'Exempt Organizations' division until late 2013 when she retired with full benefits; the Justice Department said this week that it won't prosecute her for defying a congressional subpoena and refusing to answer questions . Tax-exempt organizations are not permitted to work for or against candidates for public office, but they can use up to half of their funds to make public arguments about political matters like tax policy, the Obamacare insurance overhaul, the environment or foreign policy. Dlott agreed this week that the tea party groups suing the government can pursue their claims that the IRS violated their First and Fifth Amendment rights, along with a section of federal law \u2013 Section 6103 of Title 26 \u2013 that prohibits the government from releasing private information contained in tax returns. When the Treasury Department's Office of Inspector General investigated the IRS's actions, it demanded \u2013 and received \u2013 a list of 298 groups whose tax-exemption applications had been held up. It's this list that the tea party groups want. Their lawsuit aims first to identify a list of 'all dissenting groups targeted for additional scrutiny by the IRS from January 20, 2009, through July 15, 2013.' Dlott could then choose to certify that list as a 'class' of plaintiffs. IRS commissioner John Koskinen has insisted that his agency is no longer targeting conservative groups with special scrutiny, and has offered to green-list any group that promises it will limit its political activity to 40 per cent of its budget \u2013 but some organizations are holdout out, claiming the law entitles them to a 50 per cent limit . The IRS's lawyers claimed that they couldn't provide the court with the names of all the groups, saying they would have to turn over the very documents that Section 6103 requires them to keep confidential. The conservative plaintiffs said they would be happy to have only the spreadsheet that the inspector general got from the IRS. Dlott agreed and ordered the agency to hand it over. 'The Court concludes that the return information sought is directly related to the issue of class certification in this federal court proceeding,' her ruling reads. 'The names of the putative class member organizations and their control dates \u2013 the date which the putative class member organizations submitted their applications for tax exempt status to the IRS \u2013 are directly related to the issue of class certification.' Dlott decided that without the list, the plaintiffs wouldn't be able to show all the disaffected conservative applicants it has already identified share common experiences at the hands of America's tax collectors. Courthouse News Service first reported her ruling. The IRS is the federal agency Americans most love to hate, polling worse in opinion surveys than Congress . A partial list was unearthed by USA Today\u00a0in September 2013, showing that as of 2011 the IRS had questioned the political advocacy of 162 right-wing organizations and delayed approving their tax exemptions. In an IRS spreadsheet published online by the newspaper, partisan government officials characterized the activities of 21 of those groups as 'propaganda.' Dlott also ordered the IRS to tell the court whether or not that list was authentic, The Washington Times reported. Former IRS official Lois Lerner, who has been at the center of the targeting scandal since it emerged in 23 months ago, was facing the possibility of criminal Contempt of Congress charges until the Obama administration's Department of Justice declined on Monday to prosecute her. Lerner, under subpoena in May 2013, delivered an opening statement professing her innocence during a hearing but then refused to answer questions.",

        "article": "Serena Williams will be 34 at the end of a summer that she looks all set to enter without having been beaten on tour in 2015. She heads into Saturday's final of the Miami Open with a 17-0 record, and will surely extend that winning sequence against the admirable but somewhat limited Spaniard Carla Suarez Navarro. The somewhat scary thing about Williams is that, by her own admission, she is not even playing her best, and yet she is still ahead of the rest of the field by a country mile. Serena Williams celebrates after reaching the Miami Open final to continue her unbeaten run in 2015 . Williams was taken the distance by world No 2 Simona Halep in the semi finals in Florida . The world No 1 has a win record of 17-0 since the start of the year and looks unbeatable . The younger of the two famous siblings currently has sore knees that are restricting her practice, and she was forced into a mighty struggle in the semi-final by world No 3 Simona Halep before coming through 6-2 4-6 7-5. At least the Romanian, the WTA Tour's second best player this season, was able to lay a glove on the world No 1. Every other challenger seems to be struggling in their own way and, while there is no questioning the phenomenal and enduring quality of Williams, it also says something about the rest of the field that she will probably head into the clay court season unbeaten. 1 If she wins on Saturday she will have earned \u00a34.33m in prize-money already this season. 2 She has actually lost this season, to Agnieszka Radwanska in January' s Hopman Cup, but the event's status means it does not count in the official records. 3 Straight after the Australian Open, Serena flew all the way to Argentina to play one match for the USA in the Fed Cup \u2014 which she needed to do to be eligible for next year's Olympic Games in Rio (she beat Maria Irigoyen 7-5, 6-0). 4 Serena has lost only five sets on tour this season, two at the Australian Open, one in Indian Wells, and two in Miami. 5 The player who has won most matches this season is Simona Halep on 26, but she has also lost twice. 'Somehow I've improvised my way to the final,' said Williams, who could have finished Halep off in straight sets. 'I'm just not at my best level right now and it's a little frustrating. I am not serving well, I'm serving at 40%, so it hasn't been my best of times.' And yet still she keeps winning, with no sign of the implosions that cost her at the Grand Slams last year apart from the US Open. Last year was an unusual one for women's tennis in that eight different players reached the finals of the Majors, but those who shared the biggest stages with Williams have, with the exception of Halep, failed to train on that much. In some cases it has been a trying season that has shown again how emotionally and physically taxing it is right at the top of the women's game. The youngest of tennis' most successful siblings drops to her knees after winning the Australian Open . Williams has won the last two grand slams at the US Open (left) and in Melbourne (right) Wiliams was forced to withdraw ahead of the semi finals at Indian Wells, the only blemish to her 2015 showings . The 33-year-old was presented with a celebratory cake in Miami after winning her 700th career match . The exceptionally talented Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova has actually sat out the last two significant events, here and at Indian Wells, with exhaustion. Happily it appears likely that she will be returning for the clay court season. Eugenie Bouchard faces the intimidating task of backing up her remarkable breakthrough year of 2014 that few expected, and made a good start at the Australian Open by making the quarter final. Yet she was in tears at Indian Wells as she lost to world No 85 Lesia Tsurenko and afterwards admitted she needed to relax more. In Miami she lost her opening match to Germany's Tatjana Maria, the world No 113 who is the highest ranked mother on the tour. America's Madison Keys, universally tipped as a future Grand Slam champion, was another one who struggled to contain her emotions here when she went out to Sloane Stephens. Of last year's other Grand Slam champions Li Na has retired while Maria Sharapova has yet to build on the strong start that she had in Australia. The world No 2 lost her opening match in Miami to Russian wildcard Daria Gavrilova and it is, in any event, difficult to build up any rivalry between her and Williams as she has lost against her the last sixteen times they have played. Spain's Carla Suarez Navarro is unlikely to provide much resistance against Williams in Saturday's final . Halep is closest to challenging Williams' dominance while Maria Sharapova needs to push on after a good start . Golden girl Eugenie Bouchard is a possible contender to challenge Williams after breaking through last year . America's Madison Keys, universally tipped as a future Grand Slam champion, was another one who struggled to contain her emotions here when she went out to Sloane Stephens. Of last year's other Grand Slam champions, Li Na has retired while Maria Sharapova has yet to build on the strong start that she had in Australia. Romania's Halep, a relatively late developer whose game is based on her supremely athletic movement, right now looks the biggest threat to Williams, and she might well be the best long-term bet for the French Open.",

        "article": "Unbeaten Championship leaders Leigh delivered a stunning knockout blow as Super League club Salford crashed out of the Ladbrokes Challenge Cup. The Centurions twice came from behind in thrilling fashion to beat the Red Devils 22-18 in front of a 6,358 crowd at Leigh Sports Village and stretch their winning run to 21 matches. The build-up to the fifth-round tie was dominated by the selection by Leigh of former England forward Gareth Hock despite an agreement not to play against his old club, but he played little part in their downfall. Unbeaten Championship leaders Leigh delivered a stunning knockout blow as Super League club Salford crashed out of the Ladbrokes Challenge Cup . Hock, one of five ex-Salford players in the home line-up, spent just 25 minutes on the field in two spells and looked well short of match fitness. Instead it was left to former Wigan hooker Bob Beswick to orchestrate a magnificent display by Paul Rowley's men, who trailed 6-0 and 18-12 to their Super League visitors, who were badly hit by injuries and indebted to a superb performance from French half-back Theo Fages for keeping them in contention right to the end. The match was played amid a wonderful atmosphere and the ferocity was in evidence inside the first minute when Salford forward Cory Paterson was placed on report for a high and late tackle on Leigh full-back Gregg McNally. Fages opened the scoring after seven minutes when he dummied his way over for the first try and his half-back partner Michael Dobson kicked the conversion before hurting his knee in a collision four minutes later. Dobson attempted to play on but eventually succumbed to his injury and the Red Devils also lost centre Junior Sa'u with a wrist injury before half-time. With Paterson also limping, the visitors were rocked by the flair and determination of their Championship opponents, who scored two tries in four minutes to go 12-6 ahead. Beswick was the provider each time, a short pass getting veteran forward Tommy Goulden over from close range while McNally finished off his break from halfway, and Martyn Ridyard kicked both conversions. That was the signal for Hock to enter the fray but Salford turned the tables with two tries either side of the break from Niall Evalds to retake the lead. They drew level on 34 minutes when Fages broke clear to get the full-back over for his first try and got his over again three minutes into the second half courtesy of a neat reverse pass. Paterson kicked both goals to make it 18-12 and Leigh missed a glorious chance to level matters when centre Tom Armstrong got winger Liam Kay haring for the corner only for him to lose the ball in Fages' last-ditch tackle. Just when Salford seemed to be in control, the game took a new twist as Leigh stormed back in front. They were thrown a lifeline on 63 minutes when Salford winger Ben Jones-Bishop's careless pass was snapped up by Leigh half-back Ryan Brierley for a gift of a try. Ridyard's third goal tied the scores and the Centurions regained the lead three minutes later McNally fashioned a try for winger Johnathan Pownall. There was no shortage of action right to the end but Leigh, who pushed Leeds all the way in last year's quarter-final, hung on and just about deserved their famous victory.",

QPR had lost 13 of 14 league away games before Saturday's vital 4-1 victory at West Brom. The win also saw the west London club to end a five-game losing run, while they remain in 19th place just three points adrift of safety. Chris Ramsey urges his players to calm down during the 4-1 win against West Brom on Saturday . Eduardo Vargas (centre) celebrates with his QPR team-mates after opening the scoring  against West Brom . 'It's a fantastic victory for us,' QPR coach Chris Ramsey said in Monday's press conference. 'The morale has been good, very professional. 'The players have this belief.' QPR want to build on that success in Tuesday's game at Villa Park. 'We are going to approach the game in the same way as we have done in the past,' Ramsey said. Ramsey believes QPR could have won previous games but lacked a finishing touch and also had shaky moments in defence. 'We are hoping that we can be as clinical as we were on Saturday,' he said. QPR were not able to profit from their latest win with an improved league position, but have revealed themselves to be a combative team that have a fighting chance of survival. Bobby Zamora scored QPR's third goal with an astounding lob from a narrow angle against West Brom . Ramsey issues instructions from the touchline as QPR boosted their survival hopes with a vital win . 'We want to put pressure on the teams around us,' Ramsey said. 'Everybody seems to be responding to what others are doing. 'The pressure is equal.' Villa currently hold the last position of safety but have lost their last two league games, including a 3-1 defeat at Manchester United at the weekend. 'I would rather be going into the game with the advantage they have rather than us,' Ramsey said. 'We have more pressure.' Even so, Ramsey knows Tim Sherwood's Villa side are feeling the heat. 'Villa are close to us and they are going to want three points to climb further up above the line,' Ramsey said. Ramsey will be coming up against friend and former colleague Tottenham Tim Sherwood on Tuesday . QPR have a sense of urgency to win at Villa and will have the same mindset when they host Premier League leaders Chelsea on Sunday. Ramsey believes his players can get a good result in both games. 'The Premier League is a league that things happen that you can't expect,' he said. Villa are not going to be at full strength, but Ramsey said: 'I'm sure that they will be able to fill those positions adequately, it's not going to be an advantage.' As for his friend Sherwood, who was put in charge of Villa in February, Ramsey said: 'I'm happy for him that he has gone to a big club like Aston Villa and wish him the best.'",

A screenshot of the letter was shared on Twitter, and in a matter of minutes amassed more than 2,000 shares. The heartfelt message was posted by airline pilot Jai Dillon, who was shown the A4 by a colleague in the industry. A heartfelt letter left by passenger 'Bethanie' to the pilot who 'got her home safely,' has been shared on Twitter . He wrote on Twitter: 'A letter given to a colleague from a passenger onboard his aircraft.. Providing proof that we're all in this together,' alongside the touching note. In it, a passenger known only as 'Bethanie' writes how, in light of the recent Alps plane crash, she feels the need to 'reach out' and 'extend a compassionate hand.' The woman thanks the pilot and the airline, which is not mentioned, for 'allowing her' to live her life in Spain, while splitting the time with family in England too. There was an outpouring of emotion on Twitter after the letter was posted by pilot Jai Dillon . The terrible scene of the Germanwings plane crash in the French Alps, where pilot Andreas Lubitz deliberately crashed the plane . She writes that she hopes the letter can create 'a ripple effect and spread some compassion and understanding,' among those who have such responsibilities.

The role of the pilot was praised by many on Twitter following the letter being posted . Cheshire-based Mr Dillon said he happy to share the 'positive message,' according to the Evening Standard. Investigations are continuing in the events of that fateful day last week over the French Alps.

The sharing of the letter led to thousands of shares and 'favourites' on Twitter . And he was being treated by a psychotherapist, Dusseldorf prosecutor's office spokesman Christoph Kumpa said.

        "article": "As the anniversary of their daughter's suicide approaches, Michael and Jane Cleland have spoken of their battle to have the two teenage boys, who they say bullied their daughter to death, held accountable for their actions under cyber bullying laws. Jessica Cleland, from Wallan, Victoria, was 19 when she took her own life on Easter Saturday last year, after receiving Facebook messages from two teenage boys she considered friends saying that they hated her, and that she was a 'f***ing sook'. Her parents said that Jessica's social media accounts were flooded with horrible sentiments the night before she died, and are now desperate to see a change within\u00a0Victoria\u2019s Government and the state's police so that those found guilty of  cyber bullying face serious consequences. The parents of Jessica Cleland (pictured) are campaigning for anti-bullying laws to be taken more seriously . 'What we would like to see happen is that if someone is cyber bullying somebody and they cause something like this, then they should be held \u00adaccountable for it,' said Jessica's father Michael. On Easter Saturday last year, Jessica told her her mother that she was going for a run. Her sister Amy became concerned after seeing an Instagram photo Jessica uploaded with the caption 'I love this place and I am never going to leave'. Jessica's father found her body on the Sunday in the same place where the photo had been taken. The Cleland's said that Jessica was a vibrant and and outgoing girl, who was looking forward to her gap year and had never exhibited symptoms of depression or mental illness before the two former friends began bullying her online. Coroner Jacqui Hawkins said in the report she released in October that Jessica's death highlighted the impact that social media could have on the lives on young people, and that both Facebook and text messaging was 'problematic' for the teenager. 'Easy access to the internet on her phone meant that she was exposed to potentially upsetting communications 24 hours a day; and she was able to return to, and re-read, the upsetting messages at a later time and therefore appears to have continued to ruminate about them,' the coroners report said. 'Although it is not possible to identify, with any degree of certainty, the factors contributing to a person's decision to take their own life, it is evident that messages received by Jessica online proximate to her death...were precipitating factors,' reported\u00a0The ABC. Jessica (pictured right, with her sister Amy, left) committed suicide after she was bullied over Facebook . Following the release of the coroners report, the Cleland's are now campaigning to see cyber bullying taken more seriously in Victoria and around Australia. Victoria already has anti-bullying legislation known as Brodie's Law, which was introduced in 2011 after the death of Brodie Panlock, who committed suicide after being subject to relentless bullying in her workplace. The crime is punishable by ten years in jail, and applies to cyber bullying as well as physical, verbal and psychological bullying. Despite these laws, and the finding of the coroner who named the two teenage boys, there has been\u00a0no charges and no inquest into Jessica's death, which the Cleland's labelled as a failure. Police also failed to produce a warrant to obtain communication between Jessica and her bullies from Facebook and Snapchat. The Cleland's said that they were disappointed with the Victorian police for failing to investigate and want to see the teenagers held accountable for their actions. 'If you accidentally hit someone in your car you can get manslaughter. What\u2019s the difference if you bully someone and cause them to take their own life?', Jessica's mother Jane told The Herald-Sun. 'They keep saying they\u2019re going to have a big push on cyber bullying and try to knock it on the head, but it seems like it\u2019s too much hard work.' Jessica's grandmother wrote of the impact of the 19-year-old's death on the family, and called for harsher enforcement of the anti-bullying legislation. 'It seems there is a law in Victoria that criminalises cyber bullying, but it doesn't get enforced because of the police paperwork...Cyber bullying is a silent killer of too many of our young ones,' she wrote. 'We have the evidence ... but where's the justice?' If you or someone you know is struggling with mental illness or depression, please contact Lifeline on 13 11 14.",

The relegation-battling Clarets have struggled for goals in recent weeks, despite some gritty performances, scoring just once in six games. The hotly-rated Ings, whose future beyond the end of the season has been the subject of considerable speculation, has not found the net in seven appearances. Danny Ings has found goals hard to come by in recent weeks as he looks to try and fire Burnley to safety . Dyche hopes the barren spell is not weighing too heavily on the 23-year-old's mind and has urged him to focus on enjoying his game. Dyche said: 'He's a bright young lad. He's a very good player and a good young lad who is grounded. 'But you can't actually get inside someone. When that whistle blows it's down to them to remind themselves of that freedom I speak about. I want players to play that way. 'His biggest thing is he puts a lot of demand on himself - and that can be a weakness as well as a strength. It's good that he has a thirst to improve, as do a lot of the players. But it has to be balanced with that enjoyment. Sean Dyche is confident that if Ings starts to enjoy playing more, then the goals will flow for the striker . 'I often say to him, play with a smile and I've told him he's best when he does. We're looking to him to continue doing that.' Burnley's battling performances have earned plaudits and despite the lack of goals, they have collected five points from a tough run of eight games. Amid that run they have beaten Manchester City and taken points off Chelsea and Tottenham. They are in the bottom three but just two points from safety and Dyche is backing his forwards to come good again. He said: 'There's certainly not pressure (on the strikers) from me. We ventured down this road early season when the goals didn't come as freely then we had a good patch over the Christmas period. 'We have scored goals and been productive in front of goal. It's about reminding the players what it takes to do that, different ways of doing that and how we can affect games.' The 23-year-old has had an impressive season nonetheless, scoring nine goals in his debut top-flight year . Ashley Barnes (right) says he's forgotten about the Nemanja Matic incident and moved on . Striker Ashley Barnes insists confidence remains high among the group. Barnes said: 'We are in this together. We are striving for one thing - to stay in this league come the end of the season. That is the main aim. 'The positivity around the group and the staff remains the same and hopefully will continue.' Barnes has found himself in the spotlight of late following his controversial tackle on Chelsea's Nemanja Matic. The 25-year-old escaped punishment but Matic was sent off for his reaction to the challenge in a heated confrontation. Barnes says that incident is now behind him. 'It has gone,' he said. 'I moved on a while back. I am just concentrating on staying in this league.'",

ALEKSANDAR KOLAROV\u00a06.5 \u2013 Went close with slightly deflected freekick and another effort from a tight angle in the second half. Defensively, faced little threat from Valencia. FRANK LAMPARD\u00a06 \u2013 Only his fifth Premier League start for City and of lack match sharpness showed on occasions as his touch let him down. Manchester City midfielder Frank Lampard was given a rare chance to impress by starting against West Ham . FERNANDO\u00a06.5 \u2013 Didn\u2019t have too much on his plate but was alert to track Kouyate\u2019s burst from midfield in the first half and produced a fantastic interception tackle. JESUS NAVAS\u00a08 \u2013 Much better from the little Spaniard. More direct and looked for an earlier pass, which contributed to both of City\u2019s first two goals. Jesus Navas played a major role in Manchester City's two goals at the Etihad Stadium . YAYA TOURE\u00a07 \u2013 A more lively display than of late from the much-maligned Ivorian who passed the ball well and his interception started the move for City\u2019s second goal. DAVID SILVA\u00a06.5 \u2013 Subdued display despite going close with a couple of efforts, and stretchered off following lengthy treatment after taking an elbow to the head from Kouyate. SERGIO AGUERO 7.5 \u2013 The Argentine\u2019s third goal in two games took his total to 26 for the season, and the top of the Premier League scoring charts with 20. Can\u2019t argue with that. Sergio Aguero celebrates with City team-mates Navas and Yaya Toure after putting his side 2-0 up . Manchester City ace Sergio Aguero wheels away in celebration after scoring his 20th Premier League goal . Subs: Caballero, Sagna, Boyata, Fernandinho (for Lampard 88), Nasri (for Silva 75, 6), Dzeko (for Aguero 90+1), Pozo. Scorers: Collins og 18, Aguero 36 . Booked: Navas, Silva . WEST HAM (4-1-4-1) ADRIAN\u00a06 \u2013 Had little chance with either of City\u2019s goals, particularly Collins\u2019s own-goal which looped over his head and in off the underside of the bar. CARL JENKINSON\u00a06 \u2013 One of West Ham\u2019s better defenders and produced an excellent interception to deny Aguero an almost certain goal in the second half. JAMES COLLINS\u00a05 \u2013 Won\u2019t enjoy seeing a replay of his freakish own-goal. Almost redeemed himself with a great block on Silva \u2013 but not quite. West Ham centre back James Collins diverted the ball past Adrian to give Manchester City an early lead . WINSTON REID 5.5 \u2013 Did his best to hold City at bay but guilty of an awful dive in the dying stages that was thankfully ignored by the referee and ridiculed by the City fans. AARON CRESSWELL 5.5 \u2013 After his goalscoring exploits against Stoke last weekend, had a difficult afternoon up against Navas and struggled to cope at times. ALEX SONG 5 \u2013 Had his hands full trying to screen West ham\u2019s defence against the blue tide in the first half and replaced by Jarvis as Big Sam tried to salvage something in the second. Alex Song, pictured with Lampard, was replaced by manager Sam Allardyce in the 66th minute . CHEIKHOU KOUYATE 6 \u2013 His arm into Silva\u2019s face was the talking point of a dull game. It seemed to be more careless than malicious but City may think otherwise. MARK NOBLE 5 \u2013 Overrun in midfield and was able to offer his team very little. Struggled tpo get into the game at all. STEWART DOWNING 4.5 \u2013 Lost the ball in the build-up to City\u2019s second goal and that summed up his performance. Below-par and lacked any impact at all. ENNER VALENCIA 6 \u2013 Anonymous in the first half but picked up a bit after the interval and had West Ham\u2019s best effort with a fine individual run and shot. CARLTON COLE 4.5 \u2013 Was gifted the Hammers\u2019 best opportunity in the first half but took too long to get a shot off. Struggled with little service and replaced by Nolan. Carlton Cole failed to impress on his first start  since his side's 0-0 draw with Southampton in February . Subs: Nolan (for Cole 66, 6), Jarvis (for Song 66, 6), Nene, O\u2019Brien, Amalfitano, Jaaskelainen, Burke. Booked: Kouyate, Downing . Referee: Anthony Taylor 6.5 . Star man: Jesus Navas .",

        "article": "The leader of Kazakhstan has apologised after winning the presidential election with 97 per cent of the vote saying it would have been 'undemocratic' for him to make his victory more modest. Nursultan Nazarbayev, a 74-year-old former steel worker who has ruled the oil-producing nation since 1989, has won another five year term. Kazakh television showed a triumphant Nazarbayev walking on a red carpet, smiling and shaking hands and greeting thousands of jubilant supporters at a forum in the capital Astana. Nursultan Nazarbayev, who has been re-elected as president of Kazakhstan after winning 97 per cent of the vote . But international monitors have voiced their concern about the poll saying there was not a genuine choice of other candidates with most of his vocal opponents either being jailed or fled abroad. However, at a news conference, Nazarbayev said: 'I apologise that for super-democratic states such figures are unacceptable. But I could do nothing. 'If I had interfered, I would have looked undemocratic, right?' The election was called more than a year before Nazarbayev's term was due to end, averting the risk that another year of economic pain could develop into a more serious challenge to his leadership. It also puts the question of a possible successor, an important issue for investors, off the table for now. Kazakhstan has been criticised by the West and human rights bodies for crackdowns on dissent. No election held there has yet been given a clean bill of health by monitors. However, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping promptly congratulated Nazarbayev on his re-election. Nazarbayev told a news conference after his victory that if he had interfered in the vote, it would have been undemocratic . Meanwhile Nazarbayev has promoted market reforms in the country and attracted $200 billion in foreign direct investment, turning his nation of 17 million into the second-largest economy in the former Soviet Union and number two post-Soviet oil producer after Russia. The multi-ethnic, mainly Muslim country is stable in a region troubled by ethnic violence from Kyrgyzstan to Afghanistan. Nazarbayev has promoted 'a multi-vector policy', building good ties with neighbouring Russia and China as well as the United States and the European Union. But the economy has been hurt in the past year by the decline in global energy prices and by economic difficulty in neighbouring Russia, hit by Western sanctions over Ukraine. Kazakh economic growth is forecast to slow to 1.5 percent this year from a 4.3 percent rise in 2014. Gross domestic product may actually shrink if oil prices drop to below $50 per barrel, Kazakh officials have said.",

        "article": "(CNN)Think it's hard to redeem your miles for an airline award ticket? It depends on which airline rewards program you've chosen, which route you're flying and when you book your ticket, according to a new Consumer Reports study of 70 million passenger trips over the past two years. The magazine collected statistics comparing award-seat availability for the five biggest U.S. airlines on domestic routes. The top performer was Southwest Airlines, which offered the most award tickets, 11.9 million, and the highest percentage of award tickets -- 11.5% of 103.1 million total passenger seats. \"The high number of award tickets is directly related to Southwest's unique combination of 'Every Seat is an Award Seat,' no blackout dates, points that don't expire, and a route map that reaches more than 90 different destinations in the U.S. and beyond, making us the largest domestic carrier in the U.S.,\" Southwest spokesperson Thais Conway Hanson told CNN. \"Unlike other carriers, we also don't charge fees for close-in bookings or penalize you for canceling your trip if something else comes up.\" At the bottom of the list was JetBlue, which offered the lowest percentage of award seats and the fewest number of award tickets of the five biggest U.S. airlines: 892,000 one-way passenger tickets, or 4.5% of its total 19.7 million U.S. seats. (JetBlue only operates in 10 of the top 25 markets included in the study.) Many JetBlue customers fly the airline only once or twice per year, making it hard to accumulate miles, an airline spokesman told the magazine. By not allowing miles to expire anymore, the airline says customers will be able to eventually redeem them. Delta Air Lines came in second place with 5.6 million U.S. award seats; United Airlines ranked third with 5 million U.S. award tickets; and American Airlines was fourth with 3.5 million U.S. award seats. What are the world's safest airlines? Remember that award tickets aren't actually free. The cost of miles is built into everything you buy that's earning you miles, and the airlines profit from you not using your miles at all. So it behooves consumers to book award travel carefully. On average, nearly 10% of passengers on the five airlines analyzed by Consumer Reports flew on domestic award tickets, but some of them weren't getting the best value for their miles. While many U.S. fliers redeemed miles on American Airlines flights from Los Angeles to San Francisco, the cheapest average fare on that route was just over $100 -- not worth the 12,500 to 30,000 miles needed for an award ticket, Consumer Reports says. Better to use them on American Airlines' route between New York and San Francisco or Delta's route between Chicago and Los Angeles, which are generally more expensive than that Los Angeles-San Francisco route, according to Consumer Reports' calculations. While award-seat availability is important, it may not matter as much as passengers' overall satisfaction with an airline. Southwest had the highest customer satisfaction score (86), followed by JetBlue (85), Delta (70), American (66) and United (63). And don't forget the fees. Southwest doesn't charge any fees, while other airlines tack on fees for checking bags, booking by phone, changing plans and more.",

        "article": "Experts said the rise in the number of reported rapes and sexual offences was due in part to high profile historic cases like Jimmy Savile's . A surge in the number of sex attacks reported to police has fuelled the first rise in recorded crime for more than a decade. Nearly 3.8million crimes were recorded by police last year, an increase of 2 per cent from 2013, figures released yesterday revealed. And a record number of rapes and other sex crimes were logged \u2013 up by a third (32 per cent) to 80,200, or 220 a day. But experts say the rise \u2013 the first since 2003-04 \u2013 was partly because victims were 'more willing' to report sex crimes, including historical ones, and police were more likely to take complaints seriously, in the wake of the Jimmy Savile sex abuse scandal. Fay Maxted, chief executive of the Survivors Trust, which represents more than 130 rape and sexual violence charities, said: 'Under-reporting is a real problem in sexual offence cases. 'One of the effects of Operation Yewtree, in the wake of Savile, has been it has brought sexual cases to the fore. The convictions of Rolf Harris and Stuart Hall have encouraged people to feel justified in coming forward.' The Office for National Statistics, which published the data, said the rise was also due to police recording complaints more accurately after accusations of 'fiddling' figures to meet targets. A police watchdog recently found a fifth of crimes were not being logged properly. The latest ONS figures showed that the number of murders and manslaughter cases in England and Wales has fallen to its lowest level for 38 years. Police recorded 515 homicides last year, 37 fewer than in 2013. But the number of rapes recorded was the highest ever at 26,703, which is an average of 73 attacks every day. Rapes at knifepoint were up by 31 per cent to 311 attacks and there were 53,559 other sexual offences recorded. Violent offences also jumped by 21 per cent to nearly 741,000. The ONS report said of the overall rise in recorded crime: 'This is the first increase since 2003-04 but needs to be seen in the context of the renewed focus on the quality of crime recording.' The high-profile convictions of Rolf Harris (left) and Stuart Hall (right) have made victims feel more confident about coming forward, said campaigners . The number of crimes logged by police is still 20 per cent lower than in 2008-09 \u2013 under the last Labour government. The picture was complicated by figures from the Crime Survey of England and Wales, which found a 7 per cent fall in overall crime to 6.9million incidents, the lowest level since 1981. The survey, which looks at people's experiences of crimes, includes incidents not reported to police. But some crimes, such as bank and credit card frauds, are left out, distorting the true rate of offending. Home Secretary Theresa May said the data showed 'police reform is working' and that crime 'has never been lower, meaning families are safer'. But her Labour shadow, Yvette Cooper, claimed that the ONS figures 'expose the shocking complacency of David Cameron and Theresa May over crime and policing'.",

        "article": "After a heavy night of drinking, your immune system is bound to be weaker. This is because your body is under oxidative stress - a process that can also happen after smoking, breathing in pollution and even sunbathing. Now, for the first time, researchers have shown that higher doses of vitamin E, found in foods such as kale and almonds, can mitigate the stress on immune cells. After a heavy night of drinking, your immune system is bound to be weaker.\u00a0Now, for the first time, researchers have shown that higher doses of vitamin E found in foods such as kale (left) and almonds, can mitigate the stress on immune cells . Whenever a virus or other pathogen enters our bodies, a certain class of immune cells - the T cells0 jump into action, spreading rapidly. One sub-class of these cells, the CD8+ T cells, eliminate the virus by killing cells it has infected. Other T cells, known as CD4+ T cells, coordinate the immune response to all kinds of pathogens. But a week can pass before these T cells start to take their toll on a virus. And with cells dividing every eight to twelve hours, it takes a few days to gather a strike force of cells in the hundreds of thousands: enough to overwhelm the infection. But this immune response does not work if significant oxidative stress is damaging the T cells and depriving the body of the tools it needs to repair them, according to a new study. A white blood cell, also known as a T cell, carries special structures on its surface with which to recognise specific pathogens . If the immune cells lack repair enzyme Gpx4, the T cells die off as they divide, which means the immune system becomes weak and the infection can be chronic. This is the enzyme responsible for repairing oxidative damage to the cell membrane. Your body constantly reacts with oxygen as you breathe and your cells produce energy. As a consequence of this activity, highly reactive molecules are produced known as free radicals. Free radicals interact with other molecules within cells. This can cause oxidative damage to proteins, membranes and genes. Oxidative damage has been implicated in the cause of many diseases, such as cancer and Alzheimer's and has an impact on the body's aging process. External factors, such as pollution, sunlight and smoking, also trigger the production of free radicals. Source: NetDoctor . When testing mice whose immune cells lacked the repair enzyme, researchers led by Manfred Kopf, a professor at ETH Zurich, were able to save the immune cells by mixing a high dose of vitamin E into the animals' food. That was enough antioxidant to protect the T cells' cell membranes from damage, so they could multiply and successfully fend off the viral infection. At 500 milligrams per kilogram of mouse feed, this quantity of vitamin E was ten times higher than was present in their normal food. 'The benefit of vitamin tablets is a controversial topic,' says Kopf. With little scientific evidence as yet making a strong case for vitamin supplements, he felt their study was all the more interesting because it proved the effectiveness of vitamin E. 'Our work shows that even a genetic defect in a major part of a cell's antioxidative machinery can be compensated for by delivering a high dose of vitamin E. That is new and surprising.' What Kopf isn't yet sure of is what impact the results of their study will have on human health. He claims that people with a normal level of health and a balanced diet shouldn't need vitamin supplements. But he added a supplement of vitamin E or other liposoluble antioxidants could well make sense in the event of oxidative stress, which can arise in everyday situations such as an infection or exposure to sunlight.",

        "article": "Facing investigation:\u00a0Rifaat al-Assad, 77,\u00a0is being probed by French police over his \u00a364million fortune . The uncle of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is facing a criminal investigation in France after amassing a \u00a364million fortune despite being kicked out of Syria 'with nothing' 30 years ago. Prosecutors in Paris have revealed details of the year-long probe into Rifaat al-Assad's finances. Mr al-Assad, 77, went into exile in Europe after staging a failed coup against his brother Hafez al Assad, who was Syria's president at the time and is also Bashar's father. He has since spent more than 30 years living a life of luxury moving between homes in Paris, London and the southern Spanish city of Marbella. The inquiry into the former Syrian vice president's finances was triggered by Sherpa, an activist group representing the victims of\u00a0financial crime, which claims his fortune was stolen during his time at the heart of the Syrian regime. His family's assets, outlined by French customs in a May 2014 report, are valued at around \u00a364million - much of it held through a web of businesses based in Luxembourg. Mr al-Assad has vehemently denied acquiring assets in France through illegal means. He also told investigators he 'had nothing' when he left Syria, having always given his wages away to the poor, according to a source close to the investigation. 'It was (then French president) Francois Mitterrand who asked me to come to France... he was very kind,' he said, according to the source. On Friday, one of Mr al-Assad's lawyers said: 'Were there even the slightest doubt over my client's real estate ... would President Francois Mitterrand have awarded him the Legion d'Honneur (France's highest distinction) in 1986?' He told Reuters that his client's property holdings dated back to 1984-1986 and were transparent and legal. Heart of the regime: Rifaat al-Assad (left) is pictured with his brother, the late Syrian president Hafez al-Assad, in 1984 before his exile from the country . His nephew: Activists say\u00a0Rifaat al-Assad (pictured in 1984, left), who is the uncle of current Syrian President Bashar (right), stole money from the country while operating at the heart of its government . His son Siwar al-Assad told France Info radio his father had received funds since 1984 from 'states, leaders and friends abroad'. That included a gift from the king of Saudi Arabia of a 45 hectare (111 acre) property and stud farm north of Paris, he said. Mr Al-assad claims he invested these gifts in property, but did not keep a close eye on the details. 'I only occupy myself with politics,' he said, according to the source. 'They bring me papers to sign... I don't know how to pay, even in restaurants.' Other members of the family have given evidence that Saudi backers have supported them ever since their exile in the 1980s. Another of Mr Al-assad's lawyers Benjamin Grundler says his client 'lives principally from the sale of apartments... and from the regular help of Saudi Arabia', stressing 'it is not Syrian money'. Defending his father: Siwar al-Assad - \u00a0the son of\u00a0Rifaat al-Assad and Bashar's cousin - told France Info radio his father had received funds since 1984 from 'states, leaders and friends abroad' However, French Syria expert Fabrice Balanche, of CNRS University in Lyons, told the probe he is highly sceptical about the explanations. Speaking to investigators, he said: 'Saudi Arabia has no interest in supporting Rifaat, who doesn't represent anything.' Mr Al-assad commanded Syria's notorious internal security forces in the 1970s and early 1980s. Those forces carried out the bloody Hama massacre in 1982, which crushed a small Islamist uprising by the Muslim Brotherhood, killing between 10,000 and 25,000 civilians in the process, according to Amnesty International. Mr Al-assad has always denied having a leading role in the massacre.

        "article": "Comedian Dave Hughes has refused to apologise for calling radio broadcaster Derryn Hinch a 'w**ker' on national television. Hughes and Hinch appeared on Monday night's Q&A panel discussing depression and alcohol, following the emergence of a video featuring Prime Minister Tony Abbott skolling a beer in a pub. Audience member Lauren Hayes asked Minister for Trade and Investment Andrew Robb if he thought Mr Abbott's  'display of irresponsible drinking was an act of peer pressure or an attempt to become more popular with younger voters'. Scroll down for video . Australian comedian Dave Hughes (pictured) called radio broadcaster Derryn Hinch a 'w**ker' on national television . This sparked Hinch to question if binge drinking was as prevalent back when he was younger as it was today. But Hughes interjected and said this culture had existed and people drank to get drunk. To which the radio personality replied: 'I drank because I like the taste of wine.' Without missing a beat, the Australian comedian fired back: 'That's because you're a w**ker.' Hinch (above) and Hughes were on ABC's Q&A on Monday night discussing alcohol and depression . But Hinch would not have any of it, saying: 'It takes one to know one.' Hughes told Kiis 101.1 radio he would not recant his comment about Hinch. 'I absolutely stand by it.\u00a0In that moment, and I think Derryn would agree... he was a w**ker,' the comedian said on Tuesday morning. And the veteran radio personality did not seem to mind the put down. 'I've been insulted by experts so I can handle it,' Derryn told the Melbourne radio station. 'I thought David Hughes was quite quiet last night. The episode came after a video surfaced of Tony Abbott skolling a beer in a Sydney pub on the weekend . Mr Abbott downed a schooner of beer in about six seconds while patrons cheered and encouraged him . 'Normally I look at him and he belongs to that breed of... comedians who think the louder you tell a joke the funnier it gets. I wasn't offended.' On social media, one Twitter user stood behind the radio broadcaster, saying:\u00a0'Boogly-eyed comedian Dave Hughes' high-horse 'w**ker' comment was way out of line; great response.' Another called Hughes out by using the comedian's same insult: 'Dave... is a w**ker.' But others were supportive of Hughes' view. '[Hughes] calling [Hinch] a w**ker... gold!' one supporter said. 'Hughesy is winning [Q&A] because you're a w**ker hinch,' another Twitter user said. Monday night's Q&A also saw a more serious Hughes tell the audience about his battles with alcohol and depression. 'When I was 21, I was drinking heavily and smoking marijuana and having sort of episodes at night, and I said to my mum that I think I've got schizophrenia,' the comedian said. 'We went to the doctor together - she was a beautiful mother - obviously, she helped me out. 'The doctor, we had a chat about it. I told him I smoked marijuana and he told me, made me stop doing that. And I did, stopped smoking marijuana and I stopped drinking.

The couple, who also have homes in Los Angeles and Berkshire, married in Venice in September. A source told The Times that strict security measures were in place around Villa Oleandra, the couple's lakeside home, ahead of the event.

Last summer a similar 'no go' order was issued to prevent paparazzi boats from lingering in the vicinity. Mr Clooney, 53, bought Villa Oleandra in 2002 for a reported 7.3million euros. He bought the adjacent Villa Margherita shortly afterwards. Alongside their Italian pile the couple own a sprawling Berkshire manor house. They bought The Mill House in Sonning in 2013 for a reported \u00a310.5million.

        "article": "(CNN)Jamal al-Labani had hoped to bring his pregnant wife and 2-year-daughter back to the United States from war-torn Yemen. But the gas station owner never made it on a flight back to his home Hayward, California. Family members have identified him as a victim killed in mortar strike last week in the southern Yemeni city of Aden. He is believed to be the first U.S. citizen killed in the current violence in Yemen. Early Tuesday evening, the 45-year-old al-Labani was on his way back from mosque prayers when he was hit in the back by shrapnel from a mortar shell, his family said. He died minutes later. Violence quickly escalated in Yemen soon afer al-Labani arrived in February. \"When he got (to Aden), after a few weeks he noticed things were starting to get bad and then the (U.S.) Embassy closed,\" his cousin Mohammed Alazzani told CNN. For the past three weeks, al-Labani had told family members he was concerned about not being able to evacuate as the situation deteriorated in the country, according to his cousin. More than 200 people have been killed in Aden in the past 11 days, according to Naef Al Bakri, Aden's deputy governor. Two days before al-Labani was killed, he told his family the last option was to try to cross the border into Oman and fly to Egypt, but he never made it. \"The airports got closed and things got worse and worse,\" Alazzani told CNN by phone. \"People were hoping things would get better, but they only got worse and worse.\" Yemen has been rocked by violence and political turmoil for months. Houthi rebels -- minority Shiites who have long complained of being marginalized in the majority Sunni country -- forced Yemeni President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi from power in January, placing him under house arrest and taking over Sanaa, the country's capital. Hadi escaped in February, fled to the southern city of Aden and said he remained President. He fled to Saudi Arabia last month as the rebels and their military allies advanced on Aden. Now the violence is intensifying as Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations target the rebels in Yemen with airstrikes. Yemeni-Americans are trapped in the conflict, but haven't gotten enough help from the U.S. government, the Council on American-Islamic Relations told CNN Sunday. Zahra Billoo, a spokeswoman for the advocacy group, said it's helping al-Labani's family and the families of other Yemeni-Americans. \"All of these other governments, Russia, China, Ethiopia, India ... they have all been evacuating their citizens. So to say that it's impossible for the U.S. to evacuate their citizens is difficult to grasp,\" Billoo said. Responding to the criticism, the U.S. State Department told CNN that there are no current plans to evacuate private U.S. citizens from Yemen. \"We encourage all U.S. citizens to shelter in a secure location until they are able to depart safely. U.S. citizens wishing to depart should do so via commercial transportation options when they are available,\" a spokesman for the State Department told CNN in a statement. \"Additionally, some foreign governments may arrange transportation for their nationals and may be willing to offer assistance to others.\" Yemeni-American advocates think more could be done. \"There have been travel warnings to Yemen for a few years now. What's not clear is, are they saying 'Be cautious' or 'Don't go at all'?\" Billoo asked. \"It still it doesn't sit well with many of us civil rights lawyers who believe that U.S. citizenship should be the ultimate protection.\" Fierce fighting continued across Yemen on Sunday amid an electrical blackout in parts of the country and political moves that could further fracture the already divided military. Intense airstrikes hit Sanaa overnight. Senior security officials in the Yemeni capital said the airstrikes targeted the military intelligence headquarters and the Defense Ministry's central command, military bases and missile depots. The blasts at the military compounds, which are inside the city, shattered the windows of many homes nearby. Meanwhile, some 16 million Yemenis living in provinces under control of Houthi rebels, including Sanaa, remained without power after an electrical blackout that began Saturday night. In the country's south, the Houthis remain in control of Aden's port and other strategic holdings, including the state broadcaster. The International Committee of the Red Cross said Sunday that Saudi Arabia has signed off on the delivery of medical supplies and personnel to Yemen, where the organization had warned that time was running out to save those wounded in airstrikes and ground fighting. CNN's Devon Sayers, Carma Hassan, Jennifer Deaton, Vasco Cotovio, Jason Hanna, Ben Brumfield, Samira Said and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.",

He said: 'I remember going here to see my very first rock and roll concert to watch Metallica perform, which was amazing. 'Hearing live music outdoors in a venue like this was part of the rock and roll experience... the scent of cigarettes and spilled beer. 'When Metallica performed their song Fade to Black, everyone held lighters up. 'It was so intense you could just feel the heat. 'That night people could see the Rubber Bowl from outer space.

        "article": "Satellite TV operator DirecTV has pulled the plug on its popular advertising campaign featuring 80s heartthrob Rob Lowe after complaints by rival Comcast. The cable company complained to the Better Business Bureau's National Advertising Division (NAD) that the ads featured a number of false claims and the watchdog has ruled that several of the campaign's claims couldn't be substantiated. The series of ads, which launched last October, featured the 50-year-old actor playing two characters: a handsome Lowe in a slick suit who is always the DirecTV customer and then an 'odd or awkward alter-ego' who was a cable user. Scroll down for video . Satellite TV operator DirecTV is ending its advertising campaign featuring 80s heartthrob Rob Lowe after complaints by rival Comcast that their claims couldn't be substantiated . The ads all ended with Lowe saying: 'Don't be like this me \u2014 Get rid of cable and upgrade to DirecTV.' The NAD report highlighted a number of inaccurate claims concerning signal reliability, shorter  customer service wait times, better picture and sound quality and a better sports package. Other issues included the 'superiority message' of Lowe's closing phrase, as well as DirecTV's 'rated No. 1 claim' and another that stated that it has been 'ranked higher than cable for over 10 years.' The NAD also recommended that DirecTV 'either discontinue the price claim featured in the \"Scrawny Arms Rob Lowe\" commercial or modify it to reflect the price of a package that included the sports programming featured in the commercial.' 'While humor can be an effective and creative way for advertisers to highlight the differences between their products and their competitor's, humor and hyperbole do not relieve an advertiser of the obligation to support messages that their advertisements might reasonably convey \u2014 especially if the advertising disparages a competitor's product,' the NAD said on Tuesday. A National Advertising Division report highlighted a series of inaccuracies concerning signal reliability, shorter customer service wait times, better picture and sound quality . 'Given the absence in the record of supporting evidence, NAD recommended the advertiser discontinue the claims.' DirecTV has said it disagrees with NAD's findings with respect to its ranking claims, picture quality claims and sports programming claims and that it plans to appeal. The operator is discontinuing the Lowe-fronted ads, but claims that 'it was always scheduled to end at the end of Q1'. 'We wanted to launch our new campaign with Hannah Davis in the Final Four [NCAA basketball championship], \u00a0Jon Gieselman, SVP, Marketing at DirecTV told TheWrap. 'We always reserve the right to bring back the Rob Lowe campaign, either in its current form or with new spots, it has been extremely successful for the brand.' The company had previously argued that its advertisements were 'so outlandish and exaggerated that no reasonable consumer would believe that the statements being made by the alter-ego characters are comparative or need to be substantiated.'",

        "article": "A Russian biker gang, which Vladimir Putin  describes as his 'friends', has camped out on the Polish border after being banned from entering the country for a World War II memorial ride. Polish authorities said last week they would ban entry to the Night Wolves, with leaders calling their plans to ride through Poland en route to commemorations of World War II a 'provocation'. The group vowed to enter anyway and 15 were seen Monday morning at the border crossing between Brest, Belarus, and Terespol, Poland. Scroll down for video . Stopped: A Belarussian border guard checks the passport of a member of Russia's pro-Putin Night Wolves motorcycle club at a border crossing with Poland near Brest .

'Friends': Vladimir Putin, centre, poses for a picture with members of the Night Wolves gang in 2011 . They were allowed to go on by Belarusian guards but  they were then held in a hangar by Polish officials. Poland is extremely critical of Russian actions in Ukraine, and is disturbed that the Night Wolves has rallied against the Ukrainian government and celebrated Russia's annexation of Crimea. Border guard spokesman Dariusz Sienicki said: 'These people will not cross into Poland. Each of them will individually receive a decision denying them entry into Poland's territory'. Some Russian bikers had been seen entering Poland earlier but they appeared to belong to another organisation whose members are allowed to enter. Stubborn: A Belarus' border guard stands in front of members of the Russian Night Wolves Motorcycle Club at a border crossing with Poland near Brest yesterday . Bond: Polish bikers welcome a Russian biker who just crossed into Poland at the border crossing with Belarus. Some Russian bikers who are not members of the Night Wolves have been allowed to enter . Many Poles view the Night Wolves with suspicion because the pro-Putin bikers have rallied against the Ukrainian government and celebrated Russia's annexation of Crimea. Members of the Night Wolves rode down en masse to Ukraine's Crimea peninsula just after it was annexed by Russia in March 2014, and members have also fought with pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. The German government has also expressed unease at the bikers and said they would not be welcome. 'This is not a normal bike club. They are tools in the hand of Vladimir Putin to make propaganda,' said Tomasz Czuwara, spokesman for the Open Dialog Foundation, a Polish group that supports Ukraine. President: The Night Wolves leader Alexander Zaldostanov, known as the surgeon, leads a procession of bikers out of Moscow as they started the memorial run on Saturday . A flag bearing the image of Stalin is seen as Night Wolves bikers gather in Moscow ahead of the memorial run . Many Poles view the Night Wolves with suspicion because the pro-Putin bikers have rallied against the Ukrainian government and celebrated Russia's annexation of Crimea . Not all Poles are against them, however. The head of a Polish bikers' group, Wiktor Wegrzyn, called the Polish opposition to the bikers 'anti-Russia hysteria'. He and dozens of other Polish bikers gathered on the Polish side of the border Monday to greet and escort the Night Wolves in case they should make it through. The Night Wolves want to travel across Eastern Europe to honour the Red Army soldiers who died in the Allied defeat of Hitler's Germany, visiting their graves and other war sites. Their aim was to arrive in Berlin for ceremonies marking the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II on May 8. They left Moscow on Saturday with tattooed leader Alexander Zaldostanov leading a column of bikers waving red flags with portraits of Stalin and the wartime slogan 'For the Motherland! For Stalin!' out of the gang's clubhouse. Russia's Foreign Ministry said it was 'indignant about the refusal of Polish authorities', and accused Warsaw of lying about the real reasons it was barring the bikers. Members of the  Night Wolves Motorcycle Club lay flowers to the Mount of Glory memorial complex in the village of Sloboda, some 25 kilometers east of Minsk,  to honour Soviet soldiers of WWII . A  Night Wolves biker gives a St. Georges ribbon to a Belarussian military academy cadet at Mount of Glory monument on the outskirts of Minsk, Belarus yesterday . The Night Wolves are closely linked to President Vladimir Putin, who has joined the bikers several times at rallies, riding a Harley-Davidson trike, and called them his 'friends.' The gang's leader, Zaldostanov, 52, nicknamed 'the Surgeon' due to his former profession, told journalists on Saturday: 'We won't change our plans or our route.' 'If they don't let us all come in together, then we will enter one by one, using numerous different entry points,' he added. 'If we give up on this rally, then we would have to give up on everything else: May 9 (Victory Day holiday in Russia)\u2026 our history and all our values,' he said. But many of the bikers said they had been unable to get visas for Europe's Schengen zone. Zaldostanov said his passport is still at an embassy in Moscow, not specifying which one, and that he did not yet know if he would get the necessary visa for the trip. The bikers intend to visit war graves and war memorials in the countries they pass through. They also plan to stop at the former Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp, built by the Nazis in occupied Poland and liberated by Soviet forces. Night Wolves bikers arrive at Mount of Glory monument on the outskirts of Minsk, Belarus, yesterday . 'I don't know what they're afraid of.

'We're not afraid of the welcome we'll get in Berlin. Our grandfathers weren't afraid!' said Alexei Vereshchyagin, a biker who was taking a break from fighting Ukrainian forces in the pro-Russian separatist hub of Lugansk.

        "article": "Two Ukip council candidates have been taken to school by a teacher who covered their sloppy election leaflet in corrections - but they claim it is a dirty tricks campaign. Suzy Howlett, 54, who specialises in teaching foreign-born children English, has embarrassed husband and wife team Derek Tanswell and Sharon Snook over their spelling, punctuation and grammar. In one section Mr Tanswell and Ms Snook promise that Ukip will 'take back control of our boarders' - so the teacher wrote in red: 'I think you mean borders, not residents of a school or guest house'. Scroll down for video . Back to school: A teacher has taken her red pen to an error-strewn Ukip leaflet that landed on her doormat . Back to basics: The teacher picked up on the use of boarders and wrote: 'I think you mean borders, not residents of a school or guest house' In their leaflet the councillors  also tell prospective voters: 'If you vote Ukip your get Ukip' - so the marker wrote: 'You'll?'. One handwritten note about the leaflet's opening paragraph says: 'This 'sentence' is long and obscure. It needs some punctuation if it is to make sense'. The Ukip candidates, from Frome, Somerset, defected to Nigel Farage's party two weeks ago and hope to be re-elected in May, having left the Lib Dems to improve their chances. Expert: Suzy Howlett, 54, who specialises in teaching foreign-born children English, took her red pen to the leaflet and sent it to her children . Mr Tanswell today said his former party have 'hacked' his emails for information to create a slapdash  leaflet to scupper their election hopes, and has called in police. However,  a party source has suggested the leaflet is genuine. He said: 'They had to rewrite everything and it looks like they didn't have time to spell check it.' Mrs Howlett, a specialist teacher with 32 years' experience, told MailOnline she enjoyed a 'happy two minutes' correcting their work. Using a red pen she highlighted the incorrect use of words, lack of apostrophes, flabby language, poor spellings and use of Americanisms. Their error-strewn Ukip leaflet has been shared thousands of times online. Mrs Howlett said: 'I marked it during a happy two minutes last night. I had heard about the leaflet from friends and my husband brought home a copy and straight away I told him I was eager to take a red pen to it. 'The part about borders - or boarders - \u00a0really made me laugh. I took a picture of my work and my children, Lucy and George, were very amused by it. They posted it to their friends, and it took off. 'I teach children who speak English as an additional language and advise other teachers about how to help them. There is no shame in having difficulties with spelling, punctuation and grammar. Some of my nearest and dearest have a few issues at times, and I am certainly not poking fun at dyslexia. 'But what I am saying is that there is a problem when people don't recognise their own shortcomings. 'I have not met the candidates, but the leaflet suggests that if you can't check something like this properly, how can you run something properly if you were to be elected. 'I am most certainly not going to vote Ukip, absolutely not, but I will not say who I will be voting for. 'I won't discuss (Ukip) policies, I will just say that the children I work with are a delight, and some of them could teach Mr Tanswell a thing or two about apostrophes'. Election campaign:\u00a0Derek Tanswell and Sharon Snook, left and right, \u00a0defected to Nigel Farage's party two weeks ago and hope to be re-elected in May . Hint: This bullet point lacks the necessary apostrophe in one of more than 20 corrections . Lost in translation: A key section to persuade voters to back them next month also backfired . Changes: Mrs Hewlett suggested in her red notes 'try not to keep using apostrophes for plurals' A picture of the annotated leaflet has spread across the internet after it was posted on Reddit by a user who said a mother of a friend had marked it after finding it on her doormat. The leaflet also boasted about Snook and Tanswell's campaigning which led to the creation of ten free parking spaces at the local Cattle Market car park. Mr. Tanswell says the Liberal Democrats have put out the leaflet to 'stitch him up'. He said 'They have been hacking into my emails, the Liberal Democrats. They've hacked it all and I have the police looking at it now. 'It's the Liberal Democrats who are doing it all. They've hacked into my emails, they've basically got hold my stuff, they are producing it, they are sending it out, they are doing everything they can. 'I'm receiving about 20, 30 phone calls before 12 o'clock today threatening to kill me. The police are on to all of that'. Mr. Tanswell, 48, who runs a plumbing and heating company, added: 'I used to be a Liberal Democrat councillor. 'About a month ago, I left the Liberal Democrats to go UKIP and obviously a lot of them don't like it, so they are producing stuff like [the flyer] and putting it out and putting my name to it. 'I spoke to the police this morning. They are worried about it because people are making threats to kill me and stuff. Supportive: Mrs Howlett says she was not poking fun, adding: 'There is no shame in having difficulties with spelling, punctuation and grammar' 'They believe the propaganda from the national parties, like the Liberal party are saying that UKIP are racist. That's not true. They don't like it. 'I was a Liberal Democrat councillor and I've gone to UKIP - they don't like that. These people are very vindictive. 'I don't know who the death threats are coming from but the police are investigating it now. 'The Liberal Democrats have put all that s*** out about me. They've stuck a load of stuff on my Facebook, they hacked into that.' A Liberal Democrat spokesman said this afternoon: \u2018The idea that the Liberal Democrats had anything to do with Cllr Tanswell\u2019s absurd allegations is categorically untrue. 'Liberal Democrats take the accusation that the party was involved in illegal activity such as the hacking of emails seriously, and the local party is exploring its options.\u2019 Mrs Howlett asked MailOnline to include a link\u00a0to the charity Against Malaria, recommended by the charity Effective Altruism, which her son George, 24, volunteers for.",

        "article": "Jet-setter: Elvis Presley bought both planes in 1975 . They've been one of the biggest highlights of Graceland for 30 years. But Elvis Presley\u2019s planes are to be taken from the grounds of his former mansion after local officials signed off the controversial deal. Memphis City Council agreed yesterday that Hound Dog II and Lisa Marie \u2013 named after the King of Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll\u2019s daughter \u2013 can be moved from his estate to a site nearby. It means tourists to Graceland will have to pay extra if they want to see the two jets, which are to form a new, separate museum about the dead singer. Graceland visitors can currently buy a ticket that includes a tour of Presley's home-turned-museum and the interiors of the two planes. They have been at the estate since the mid-1980s after Graceland\u2019s managing company, Elvis Presley Enterprises (EPE), agreed that the planes\u2019 owner, OKC Partnership, could have a cut of Graceland ticket sales. OKC spokesman Tim McCaskill told Memphis City Council this week that the goal was for construction work at the planes\u2019 new home to be finished in time for them to be moved there for Elvis Week in August. The site is on the same street as Graceland. Big hit: The Lisa Marie, pictured in the grounds of Graceland, was given a major overhaul by Elvis . Hound Dog II: The smaller jet was used by the star during Lisa Marie's refit and was also his back-up plane . OKC has been in a lengthy dispute with EPE, which was bought by New York-based Authentic Brands Group in 2013. Last April, EPE sent a letter to OKC, saying it was exercising its option to end their agreement and asking OKC \u2018to make arrangements for the removal of the airplanes and the restoration of the site on or shortly after April 26, 2015\u2019. At one stage, Elvis\u2019s former wife Priscilla stepped into the heated row - telling fans who were outraged at the prospect of the planes being moved to \u2018calm down\u2019. Elvis's bedroom: The Lisa Marie had a custom-made, queen-sized bed for the star, who liked to fly at night . Perfectly preserved: A table and chairs in the plane. The seats are now covered in plastic to protect them . Lounge in the sky: There are four TVs in total plus a videotape system in the Lisa Marie . Hot on design: Presley, who oversaw the plane's refurbishment, insisted on gold bathroom taps . Then last September, OKC put them up for sale, saying if they couldn\u2019t stay at Elvis\u2019s former home, they would have to be sold. OKC owner KG Coker, 77, said at the time: \u2018I would love to see the airplanes stay where they are forever. \u2018Millions of fans have toured those airplanes and there's a real connection between fans and those airplanes. They are part of the Elvis experience.\u2019 The jets were expected to fetch $15million in an auction in January. But they were withdrawn from sale, and OKC made arrangements to have them displayed on land adjacent to Graceland. Hound Dog II was bought by Elvis for $900,000 in September 1975 \u2013 less than two years before his death. In November 1975 he paid $250,000 for the larger but secondhand plane Lisa Marie, and spent at least $300,000 having it renovated. He would use Hound Dog II - a Lockheed Jetstar - to fly to Lisa Marie\u2019s hangar to see how the refit was going. When it was finished, Hound Dog II became his back-up jet. Both planes were sold after the singer\u2019s death in August 1977 and bought a few years later by OKC. The Lisa Marie was installed at Graceland in 1984 and the Hound Dog II soon afterwards. Small but comfortable: The eye-catching lime-green and yellow seats in Elvis's Hound Dog II jet . Current home: The jets have been at Graceland since the 1980s, where they have their own entrance (right) Heated debate: Elvis's ex-wife Priscilla Presley joined in the row over whether the planes should stay at Graceland with this tweet to his fans last year. She turned the home into a tourist destination after he died . The Lisa Marie was bought by Elvis from Delta Air Lines in November 1975 for $250,000. It was originally built in 1960, and the singer spent at least $300,000 having the interior overhauled to suit his tastes. He gave it a penthouse-style bedroom with a queen-size bed and in-flight library, an executive conference room finished in teak - and a bathroom with gold sink and taps. The plane also had a bar, four TVs with a videotape system and a state-of-the-art stereo system with 52 speakers. Elvis had the plane painted red, white and blue with his motto TCB - for 'Takin' Care of Business' - on the tail.\u00a0It was decked out by a team that had previously designed the US president\u2019s plane, Air Force One. During the refurbishment, the Lisa Marie was in a hangar in Fort Worth. Elvis took great pleasure in flying friends there in his smaller Hound Dog II jet to check on the progress of the refit, which he personally oversaw. The Lisa Marie - a four-engine 28-passenger Convair - could fly Presley up to 3,000 miles (4,800km).\u00a0On each flight there would typically be three crew members.\u00a0It could hold a maximum of 29 people but usually there would be around eight. The custom-made bed was particularly important to Elvis as he preferred to travel by night. The last journey the plane made for the family was in August 1977 when it transported Elvis's ex-wife Priscilla and his good friend George Hamilton from California to his funeral at Graceland.

        "article": "Jockey Aidan Coleman is hoping he has received the call up for the ride that will finally help him banish his Crabbie's Grand National blues at Aintree on Saturday. The 26-year-old rides well-backed The Druids Nephew, stepping in for broken leg victim Barry Geraghty on the Neil Mulholland-trained gelding which won on the opening day of last month's Cheltenham Festival. The eight-year-old is a 12-1 shot for the \u00a31million steeplechase but Coleman knows more than most how fickle fortune can be in the biggest steeplechase in the world. Jockey Aidan Coleman (left) exits the weighing room at Haydock racecourse back in April earlier this year . The Druids Nephew ridden by Barry Geraghty clears the last jump during Day One of Cheltenham 2015 . As a 20-year-old, Coleman chose to ride seventh fence faller Stan, a disappointment turned into a calamity at the time because he had decided against partnering successful Venetia Williams-trained stablemate Mon Mome who lifted the prize at 100-1 with stand-in rider Liam Treadwell basking in glory. It was the only time in three National runs for Mon Mome that Coleman had not ridden the gelding. Coleman's two latest rides in the race have seen him unseated from a hampered The Rainbow Hunter. Coleman said: 'The Mom Mome incident was quite a blow at the time because I had a choice (of mounts) and picked the wrong one. I rode him the year before and the year afterwards, I just wasn't on him on the right day but that is just the way it goes. 'Sometimes you are ahead and sometimes you are behind \u2013 that is life in general. 'At the time I was 20, very young in life as well as racing. It was probably the first negative thing to happen in my career. 'Up until then I had never been injured, I had ridden out my claim in 14 months and was champion conditional. Since then there have been lots of good days and lots of bad days, so you become more streetwise and thicker skinned. 'I didn't had the best of luck on The Rainbow Hunter. He jumped well both times but ran into traffic problems and was more of less brought down last year. 'There is an element of luck required in any race but that applies more with the National because of the nature of the fences and the distance.' Coleman, who has enjoyed success over the famous fences in other races, feels The Druids Nephew has the right credential given that slice of Aintree luck which has so far eluded him. The jockey who hopes to be a contender for champion jockey after AP McCoy retires, added: 'It is definitely one of the best rides to pick up. Phil Smith, the chief handicapper, says he is the best handicapped horse in the race. 'The race should suit this horse. He seems quite hardy. He handled the hustle and bustle of the Cheltenham Festival and came out a very nice winner. That should stand him in good stead as far as the Aintree experience goes.'

        "article": "Friends of a British backpacker who drowned during a diving trip on the Great Barrier Reef claim staff deleted photos that were taken shortly before the doomed young woman left the boat. Bethany Farrell, 23, from Essex, died on February 17 while in Queensland's Whitsundays, a week into her dream gap-year when she went scuba diving for the first time. Two people who were on the boat when Ms Farrell died have taken to TripAdvisor to slam Wings Diving Adventures for the way they handled the tragic circumstances. While one of the reviews criticises the way people on the boat were treated amid the panic, a friend makes the shocking claim that photos of the backpacker shortly before she died were deleted. The backpacker's father is devastated that picture evidence, which may have been able to explain some of the mystery behind the drowning, was discarded before police could see it. British backpacker Bethany Farrell, 23, died on February 17 while scuba diving in Queensland's Whitsundays . 'There is no excuse,' Bethany's father Patrick Farrell, 47, told the Courier Mail. 'Grave mistakes have been made. Ultimately her life was in their hands. Now she\u2019s dead.' Ms Farrell drowned on her first ever scuba dive\u00a0after she became separated from her instructor while swimming on the Great Barrier Reef, a week after beginning her gap year. She was found 11 metres down on the seabed in Blue Pearl Bay, a beauty spot popular with divers. A post mortem determined the cause of death was drowning. Last week a number of reviews from distressed fellow travellers - who were on the charter when Ms Farrell died - emerged, slamming the tour guides' handling of the situation and claiming photographs were deliberately deleted. 'What was supposed to be a dream trip turned into the worst possible nightmare,' one user wrote. The same traveller claimed the crew had taken photographs of Ms Farrell with others before the dive, but when they contacted Wings Diving Adventure to try and get hold of the images they had been deleted. Scathing reviews have been posted to TripAdvisor slamming the\u00a0Wings Diving Adventures charter boat operators and claiming they deleted photographs of Ms Farrell . The young woman was just one week into gap year in Australia when she tragically drowned . Ms Farrell was on her first scuba diving trip when she tragically drowned near Blue Pearl Bay (pictured) 'We got in contact with wings solely because they had pictures their staff had taken of the three of us before the dive. Wings deleted these pictures to make way for pictures of their next trip.... despite the likelihood of the police wanting those pictures as evidence,' the review also read. 'Wings have made no effort in contacting our friend's family to express their condolences, we feel they are an absolute disgrace.' Another diver also on the same boat made similar claims, saying the people on the boat were left without any information for a number of hours after the incident which claimed Ms Farrell's life. 'The girl who had the accident was found dead, and what's worst is that I now know that they deleted all of the pictures that had been taken on the boat before they could give it to the girl's family or police,' another review claimed. 'This is destruction of evidence, and I want to make sure that Wings does not get away with this,' the traveller continued. This report was written by a distressed woman who was on the boat when Ms Farrell drowned. Wings refused to comment when contacted by Daily Mail Australia . Ms Farrell (not pictured)\u00a0was found 11 metres down on the seabed in Blue Pearl Bay in the Whitsundays . When contacted by Daily Mail Australia, Wings Diving Adventures declined to comment on the incident, or whether any photographs had been deleted. Queensland police said they could not comment on specific elements of the investigation. Ms Farrell's father said he was not going on a 'witch hunt' but was desperate to get the truth about his daughter's death and the photographs. 'I don\u2019t want to go on a witch hunt. But this will go to an inquest. We\u2019re heartbroken and will do anything to get to the truth,' he told the Courier Mail. The former soldier, who lives in Colchester, Essex, last spoke to his daughter on Skype two days before her death. Mr Farrell, who is divorced from Miss Farrell\u2019s mother Caron, said at the time: \u2018The instructor had three students, one of them was Bethany. One of the students decided she did not want to dive but we have not got the exact reasons why, so she remained on the boat which left the instructor, Bethany and one of her friends. \u2018At some point, the diving instructor lost sight of Bethany, then realised he could not locate her, returned the other student to the surface, sought help and went back down, presumably with some other people to help. \u2018They found Bethany dead 11 metres down. They were meant to be diving to a depth of 5 metres.\u2019 The family has been told it could be months before the events leading up to Miss Farrell\u2019s death are fully understood. Ms Farrell, who studied English literature and media at Southampton Solent University, had been in Australia for a week and met up with some friends who were already there. She had been planning to work in the country for a year and posted a series of images to her account on photosharing website Instagram in the days before her death on February 17. The case is still being investigated by Queensland Police, who will hand a report over to the coroner.",

        "article": "A Czech politician says he has created an entirely new country by claiming three-square-mile patch of land along the Croatia-Serbia border that neither country claims is theirs. Vit Jedlicka, 31, a member of the Czech Republic's Conservative Party of Free Citizens, is the self-declared president of 'Liberland', which is located on the banks of the Danube River. The land making up the so-called 'micronation' was apparently forgotten when the Balkan Peninsula which split into new countries following the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s. Mr\u00a0Jedlicka says that under international law he is now entitled to take control of the apparently 'unclaimed' territory'. Hope: If Liberland is ever formally recognised it will become the third smallest sovereign state in the world, behind the Vatican City and Monaco . Mr Jedlicka describes himself as a Libertarian and says citizens living in 'Liberland' will be able to set their own individual rate of tax, as well as drawing up their own property and personal rights. Founder: V\u00edt Jedlicka, 31, is a member of the Czech Republic's Conservative Party of Free Citizens . The anti-EU Czech politician says the idea for the state came from a desire to live in a country where 'honest' people could prosper with minimal to no interference from a centralised government. All services - such as medical, fire and refuse - would\u00a0operate\u00a0voluntarily, with the overall idea being that the nation's perfectly capable citizens would eventually work out the correct level of taxation and the right service requirements for a fully-functioning nation, without the levels being set by the state. 'We really felt restricted. We really felt under pressure,' Mr Jedlicka told Fox News. 'We really feel that Europe needs another tax haven. We need a place where people can prosper,' he added. During the phone interview Mr\u00a0Jedlicka said:\u00a0'We couldn't make our government lower taxes. I tried hard to tell my politicians that we need to lower taxes. That we need to lower regulation. 'All my opponents told me, \"you should have your own state to prove your ideas of liberty\". So I did it,' he went on to say. After extensive research into areas classified as terra nullius, or 'no man's land', Mr\u00a0Jedlicka discovered the 2.7 square mile patch of land along the Croatia-Serbia border. Unclaimed territory: Liberland is located on the Croatia-Serbia border, on the banks of the Danube River . The so-called creation of Liberland is far from the first time an individual has declared the formation of a new nation state. The most famous example is Principality of Sealand - an abandoned oil rig off the coast of Suffolk that declared independence in 1967. Although only two people live there and it has never been formally recognised, Sealand has its own football club and national flag. Even if after lengthy legal analysis proves 'Liberland' is a genuinely 'unclaimed territory', the world's new newest nation still fails one of the basic tests for\u00a0sovereignty. With only one citizen currently living in the country and access to the area strictly limited by Croatia and Serbia, there is no way Liberland is able to protect itself from neighbouring states. Even if Liberland's so-called citizens were able to reach the country, Croatia's border police still operate in the region. This means that even if Liberland does exist, it is a failed state occupied by a foreign nation. He asked the area's only resident whether he agreed to the nation-building plan and, upon being given the go-ahead, declared the formation of Liberland. If the country was ever formally recognised it would be the third smallest sovereign state in the world, behind the Vatican City and Monaco. With the motto 'Live and Let Live', Mr\u00a0Jedlicka claims he has already received 250,000 applications for citizenship, as well as financial pledges to set up the structure of a state, including establishing telecommunication infrastructure. Not everybody is so keen on the plan, however. Croatia has already reportedly declared that it will not recognise the 'micronation', adding that although it isn't taking the declaration seriously, it still considers the declaration of a nation state 'virtual trespassing'. Czech journalists also tried to visit the territory last week, but were blocked from entering and the 'Liberland' flag that was\u00a0initially\u00a0flown over the area\u00a0has apparently now been taken down. Legal experts have also poured cold water on the idea, claiming that although the territory may appear unclaimed, it is almost certainly already part of Serbia. This is because after Yugoslavia's break-up, any land in the area not claimed by Croatia was automatically absorbed into Serbia.",

        "article": "A young father has paid tribute to the toddler son he almost lost by getting a massive tattoo of the boy's portrait on the left side of his face. Christien Sechrist, a 20-year-old from Houston, Texas, had a black and white image of his young son Perseus etched onto the left side of his head in July. But a snapshot of the tattoo is quickly helping the young father to gain national attention after it was shared on\u00a0Imgur\u00a0earlier this week. And despite his critics' negative reactions to his tribute tattoo, Christien told Buzzfeed\u00a0that he doesn't regret his decision to get the controversial ink, even claiming that he would happily get it done again. Bold statement: Christien Sechrist (pictured) has a large tattoo of his son's portrait on his own face . The detailed portrait of the trainee electrician's son Perseus, which features his chubby cheeks and big eyes, takes up the entire left side of Christien's face, starting at the corner of his eyebrow and ending down by his chin. There is even some additional detail featured on his ear lobe. When he shared a picture of his new ink on his Facebook page last summer, Christien gave a shout out to the tattoo artist who designed the creation by thanking him for accurately rendering his son's image. 'Thanks Cody Gibbs for doing awesome work on me. Looks just like my son,' he wrote. But Christien soon found himself being berated by his friend Ashlee Nicole who asked if the picture was a joke. After Christien confirmed that it wasn't, Ashlee expressed her frustration with his choice of location for the tattoo, noting that the ink would likely make it difficult for the young father to get a job in the future. 'Why on your f****** face?! How are you ever going to get a real f***** job to support your son with a tattoo on your face?' she asked. Doting dad: The 20-year-old, from Houston, Texas (thought to be pictured with his son Perseus), insists that he has no regrets about his distinctive facial ink, and claims that his young son 'loves it' Snap a selfie: Christien has eagerly defended his facial ink to his friends on Facebook, many of whom questioned why he chose to get the tattoo in such an obvious location . 'It's not funny!' Ashlee continued. 'I'm going to make you come live with [me] so you don't do stupid sh** like this. Although it is a nice tat, you should have put it somewhere else.' Christien went on to call it a 'beautiful tattoo of a beautiful face on top of another beautiful face'. Meanwhile, another friend, David Overbey, predicted that regret would eventually set in. 'I give it [three] years before the regret starts [rolling] in,' he said, before noting: I'm not judging [though]. I think it's great work. But society frowns upon face tattoos.' Christien responded by saying: 'Well my son looked at it [and] smiled so that's all I care about.' Meanwhile, Derek Farmer argued that there are better ways to express his love for his son. Artistic expression: Christien already has a large tattoo design on the right of his face and the back of his head (pictured) Family ties: The doting dad posts numerous pictures of himself and his family on his Facebook account . 'You don't need a portrait of your child on your face to convince your love for him,' he wrote. 'It takes more than that.' Although not everyone was so judgmental. Cody Meyers commented: 'Yeah bro that does look sick, I plan on getting allot of art done [sic].' It's nine months later and Christien is still a fan of his ink, telling Buzzfeed that his son 'loves it'. He also has a large tattoo design of a skull and a flower on the opposite side of face. And contrary to popular opinion, the tattoo enthusiast said the his dramatic face ink has not affected his ability to find work.",

        "article": "(CNN)Pope Francis has accepted the resignation of Bishop Robert Finn, who remained on the job for years after becoming the highest-ranking U.S. Catholic official convicted in connection with the church's long-running sex abuse scandal, the Vatican announced Tuesday. Finn, who led the Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph, Missouri, was found guilty in 2012 of failure to report suspected child abuse. The case was tried by a judge instead of by jury because prosecutors wanted to protect the young victims' anonymity. Finn was convicted of one count but not a misdemeanor charge he'd also faced. He was put on two years' probation but was not forced to spend time in jail or pay a fine, according to the Jackson County Prosecuting Attorney's Office. Two charges against his diocese were dropped. At the time of his conviction, Finn said, according to CNN affiliate KCTV: \"I truly regret and am sorry for the hurt these events have caused.\" Jackson County Prosecutor Jean Peters Baker said the conviction and penalty, which included starting a $10,000 fund for sexual abuse counseling and mandatory training for church officials on how to report abuse, would have positive ramifications. \"We can be assured now that if an allegation of child abuse comes to the attention of the Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph, there will be no hesitation to report it immediately to the proper authorities,\" Baker said. The case against Finn revolved around his diocese's dealings with Shawn Ratigan, an Independence, Missouri, priest who pleaded guilty in August 2012 to five child pornography charges. Church officials found disturbing images on Ratigan's computer but didn't notify police until nearly five months later, prosecutors said. In those interceding months, the priest kept on working. And Finn kept his job as bishop, even after his 2012 conviction. The official website of the Catholic diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph still listed him as its bishop Tuesday morning. Cardinal Sean O'Malley, who took over the abuse-shaken Boston archdiocese and has become one of the Pope's point men in the United States, has acknowledged the inconsistency that someone who wouldn't be allowed to teach Sunday school was still running an American diocese. \"It's a question that the Holy See needs to address urgently,\" O'Malley said in a \"60 Minutes\" interview in November. \"There's a recognition of that ... from Pope Francis.\" Candida Moss -- a professor at Notre Dame, a Catholic university in Indiana -- said it \"doesn't look very urgent\" that a decision came down only now, nearly three years after the conviction and five months after O'Malley's comments. Several factors may have played a role in the delay, including views from lawyers or power players at the Vatican, who may be reluctant to cast blame at high-level officials who don't report allegations quickly enough to government authorities. But the timing of the announcement may make sense given that it comes weeks after Francis came under fire for the installation of a new bishop in Chile, Juan Barros, despite protesters' claims he was complicit in sexual abuse cases there. \"It kind of shook Francis' reputation,\" said Moss. \"Having this resignation and putting right one of the more visible injustices on this, especially in the U.S., I think this is a typical Francis way to reinstall confidence.\" Now that the case has been addressed, the Kansas City-St. Joseph diocese has a new leader: Kansas Archbishop Joseph Naumann. Under the Pope's directive, Naumann will be the Kansas City diocese's apostolic administrator, in addition to his regular responsibilities in Kansas, until a permanent bishop is appointed, according to an announcement on the diocese's website. \"I pray that the coming weeks and months will be a time of grace and healing for the Diocese,\" Naumann said in an open letter to parishioners. \"All of us, who are privileged to serve in leadership for the Church, do so for only a season. It is not our Church, but Christ's Church.\" Moss, the Notre Dame professor, predicted that the shuffling at the western Missouri diocese will be \"very well received,\" though some may question why it took so long. \"It's not just that it's late,\" Moss said, \"but it's that Francis could have been more explicit.\" To that point, the co-director of BishopAccountability.org asked for more elaboration than the Vatican's one-line announcement that Francis accepted the resignation \"in accordance with ... Canon Law.\" Anne Doyle, from the watchdog group that documents the Catholic church's abuse crisis, called Finn's removal \"a good step but just the beginning.\" \"The pope must show that this decision represents a meaningful shift in papal practice -- that it signals a new era in bishop accountability,\" Doyle said. \"... What no pope has done to date is publicly confirm that he removed a culpable bishop because of his failure to make children's safety his first priority. We urge Pope Francis to issue such a statement immediately.\" CNN's AnneClaire Stapleton contributed to this report.",

To visit Salcombe - without parting with millions of pounds - the Salcombe Harbour Hotel has rooms from \u00a3425 . With summer quickly approaching, many UK travellers will holiday in Salcombe to soak up a bit of sun and the million pound view. In fact, the most recent assessment places a view of the Salcombe estuary as being worth \u00a31.3 million, given the average property cost of over \u00a3600,000 and an average waterfront property price of \u00a32million. Known as 'Chelsea-on-Sea,' the idyllic waterside community is a yachting and sailing paradise, and home to fresh seafood and many stunning beaches.

        "article": "A helicopter hero travelled 23,000 miles to find every chopper he had ever flown - only to find one had been converted into a posh camping facility. Jerry Grayson, who lives in Melbourne but is originally from Arundel, Sussex, set himself the task of tracking down every aircraft he ever flew as part of Royal Navy rescue missions during the 1970s. The 59-year-old, who now designs aerial stunts for films, was once the youngest pilot to join the navy and was responsible for saving 15 yachtsmen during the doomed Fastnet Yacht Race in 1979. Former Royal Navy rescue pilot Jerry Grayson, who was involved in rescuing sailors during the Fastnet Yacht Rescue in 1979 (pictured), has tracked down every aircraft he flew in during the 1970s . After travelling 23,000 miles, including from his home in Melbourne, Mr Grayson found that one of the choppers had been turned into a glamping unit - a popular style of camping for posh campers . The Wessex Mark 1 (pictured) now resides between a gypsy caravan and an old Routemaster bus in Blackberry Wood campsite near Ditchling, Sussex . During his mission, Mr Grayson found that most of the helicopters had been blown up in target practice or turned into museum pieces. But he discovered that one chopper, a Wessex Mark 1, has been kitted out as a so-called 'glamping' unit, accommodation for campers who want something more luxurious than a traditional tent. The Mark 1, called Wessex XS 886, now resides between a gypsy caravan and an old Routemaster bus in Blackberry Wood campsite near Ditchling, Sussex. Mr Grayson said: 'It's bizarre that it's now being used to sleep in. If I'd fallen asleep in a Mark 1 35 years ago, it would have cost me my life. It didn't feel like three decades ago that I'd last set foot inside. 'But when I looked at all the switches and dials I realised I can't remember how to start the thing.' Mr Grayson's journey took him all around the UK. He is pictured at the International Helicopter Museum in Weston-Super-Mare . He also tracked down another chopper at Gunsmoke Paintball in Hadleigh, near Ipswich - where it is used as part of the course . The tour also took him to another paintball site in Bawtry Fields, Doncaster, where he found another aircraft . The helicopter may be fitted with beds, curtains and cushioned seats. But, between 1977 and 1979, Mr Grayson flew in the aircraft for six rescues out of his base in Cornwall. He said: 'We used to save people from the cliff sides. Things like children in dinghies being blow out to sea or surfers suffering with the bends. 'Once we rescued a woman who had injured herself after falling off the cliff near a theatre. The whole cast of A Midsummer Night's Dream watched as we did it.' Mr Grayson, who is writing a book about his experiences, pictured with the helicopter in which he learned to fly at the age of 17 . The former pilot at Whittington Barracks, Staffordshire (left) and Taskforce Paintball, Cowbridge, South Wales . One of two helicopters that Mr Grayson found at the Fleet Air Arm Museum in Yeovilton . Mr Grayson's interest in retracing his old aircraft was piqued when he found a website, created by a former pilot, which spoke out previous experiences. The pair got in touch and began swapping stories. And as he dug deeper into the history of the helicopters, he decided to make one last visit to each one to see what had happened to them. His trip then took him from Melbourne to several parts of the UK, including London, Sussex, Doncaster, Cambridge, Ipswich, Yeovilton and Newport. He said: 'The natural cycle of life is that a helicopter first serves its time in a front line role and then gets allocated to a second line role such as training or SAR. He was awarded with Air Forces Cross by the Queen for outstanding gallantry in search and rescue. Pictured: Mr Grayson flying a helicopter, as smoke pours out . By the age of 25, he had become the most decorated naval pilot in peacetime. Pictured: Mr Grayson flying a Wessex 1 from HMS Ark Royal during the height of the Cold War . Mr Grayson, pictured at the controls of a Wessex 5, joined the Fleet Air Arm in 1972 aged 17. It made him the youngest helicopter pilot to serve in the Royal Navy . 'It then serves one final useful role as a teaching tool for young engineers or for airport fire services. 'As most of these aircraft were built in the early 60s the only surprise was that out of the 31 Wessex helicopters I used for rescues there are still 12 in existence.' Mr Grayson joined the Fleet Air Arm in 1972 aged 17. It made him the youngest helicopter pilot to serve in the Royal Navy. By the age of 25 he had become the most decorated naval pilot in peacetime and was awarded with Air Forces Cross by the Queen for outstanding gallantry in search and rescue. As well as being a rescuer during Fastnet, Mr Grayson has previously gone head-to-head with Russian submarines and was entrusted with carrying the key for a nuclear weapon aged just 19.

The husband of billionaire heiress Tamara Ecclestone earned just \u00a365 a week from his firm last year, it was revealed today. Jay Rutland, 34, who is married to the 30-year-old daughter of Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone, saw his company bring in just \u00a33,378 over the 12 months to July 2014. The training consultant\u2019s firm Brigante Business Developments, based in Battersea, south-west London, is listed in company records as providing \u2018management consultancy activities\u2019. Its latest accounts for the year to July 2014 were filed to Companies House a fortnight ago, showing the company - which was incorporated in July 2012 - having total net assets of \u00a33,378, down from \u00a318,131 the year before. The former stockbroker - who lives with his wife and daughter Sophia, one, in a \u00a345million house in west London - married the heiress in a \u00a37million wedding in France in July 2013. The couple, who met in January 2013 and were engaged a month later, celebrated Sophia\u2019s first birthday last month with a farmyard-themed party that cost an estimated \u00a370,000. This included ponies, a zebra, a balloon house and even a magical princess. And last year Sophia enjoyed a private visit from Father Christmas and a replica electric Bentley car toy. Miss Ecclestone\u2019s family is worth an estimated \u00a33billion - and the couple are said to own a \u00a3300,000 Ferrari, \u00a3123,000 Bentley GT Continental and a \u00a3100,000 Range Rover. Family life: The former stockbroker lives with his wife and one-year-old daughter Sophia (pictured) in London . Company: Brigante Business Developments is based in this building (above) in Battersea, south-west London . A spokesman told The Sun yesterday: \u2018Although this company is still active it had not been trading in the financial year the filing reflects.\u2019 Mr Rutland's high-earning career in the City of London ended in shame in 2012, when he was banned from trading over 'market abuse'. In a damning ruling, the Financial Services Authority concluded he was not a 'fit and proper person' and his behaviour demonstrated a lack of 'honesty and integrity'. In 2013 Mr Rutland needed treatment for facial cuts after he was ambushed by two men in a mugging when he stopped his black Ferrari - just a month after marrying Miss Ecclestone. He was robbed of a \u00a350,000 Rolex and a \u00a320,000 bracelet by at least two thugs in an attack caught on CCTV, but the high-profile prosecution of a suspect was dropped due to insufficient evidence.

        "article": "Immigration controls in Australia are so tough that asylum seekers are rejected on board naval warships at sea before being returned immediately, it emerged yesterday. Australian prime minister Tony Abbott says the EU must \u2018urgently\u2019 follow his lead to stop migrants dying in the Mediterranean as they seek a new life in Europe. Yesterday Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi said his country was \u2018at war\u2019 with migrant traffickers, describing them as \u2018the slave traders of the 21st century\u2019. Scroll down for video . The Australian Navy, pictured, is processing migrants' claims while at sea before returning them home . Australia has one of the toughest immigration policies in the developed world according to experts . Australian PM Tony Abbott, pictured, has said his country's immigration controls have been strengthened . EU leaders will hold a crisis summit in Brussels today to agree a strategy after up to 900 were killed when a fishing boat from Libya capsized. They are expected to double funding and equipment for EU border-patrol missions off the North African coast. But critics believe millions of impoverished Africans and Asians are happy to set off into the Mediterranean in leaky boats because they are confident humanitarian efforts will save them and speed them to their destination. Mr Abbott has insisted: \u2018The only way you can stop the deaths is to stop the boats.\u2019 Australia detains people on the Pacific islands of Nauru or Papua New Guinea while their asylum applications are considered, in order to avoid them absconding and staying on Australian soil while their cases are heard. Those on Nauru have the \u2018opportunity\u2019 to seek a life in Cambodia \u2013 which is paid by Australia to take them \u2013 while those in Papua New Guinea can stay there under a similar deal. Any who sneak past navy patrols to set foot on Australia are barred from staying for ignoring procedure, even if their asylum claim is genuine. But it emerged yesterday that Australian premier Mr Abbott\u2019s immigration-control policy is even tougher than had been previously thought. It was revealed that officials rejected asylum claims of 46 Vietnamese aboard an Australian navy vessel \u2013 without setting foot on dry land \u2013 before the group was handed back to Vietnam last week. The screening aboard HMAS Choules is believed to have happened over a number of days after a boat was intercepted north of Australia. They were returned to the port city of Vung Tau, south of Ho Chi Minh City. Australia\u2019s Vietnamese community leaders warned that the Abbott government would be \u2018throwing people back to hell\u2019 by returning the asylum seekers. There were reports last year that an asylum seeker from an ethnic minority hill tribe was badly beaten by Vietnamese government officials after being returned by Cambodia. And Amnesty International said that claims of persecution by the Vietnamese cannot have been adequately assessed while still at sea. Amnesty\u2019s Graeme McGregor said: \u2018These reports are extremely concerning and represent a fundamental violation of refugee rights. \u2018Basic screening procedures at sea cannot be relied upon to make such life and death decisions. \u2018Instead of digging itself deeper into disrepute by negotiating secretive deals to return asylum seekers, Australia should be helping those in need and identifying safe, practical ways for refugees to reach safety. The government has repeatedly excused its secretive boat turn-backs by trying to claim that they save lives. \u2018The return of Vietnamese asylum seekers to the very country and government that they have escaped from exposes the truth about the government\u2019s policies: that they do not save people, but repel people who may need our help.\u2019 Immigration minister Peter Dutton refused to comment on the return of the Vietnamese but insisted people were not sent back to countries where they would face persecution. However, in a video to be shown to asylum seekers on Nauru, he can be seen urging them to take up the Australian offer for them to resettle in Cambodia. He tells the asylum seekers: \u2018It is a fast-paced and vibrant country with a stable economy and varied employment opportunities.\u2019",

        "article": "A second suspect has been\u00a0charged in the stabbing death of a married lawyer at an upscale Washington D.C. hotel. Jamyra Gallmon of Washington was arrested last week and charged with first-degree murder while armed for allegedly killing David Messerschmitt, 30, on February 9 at the boutique Donovan Hotel. According to a police affidavit filed in court on Thursday, she stole just $40 and the victim's Metro SmarTrip card. Her roommate - and alleged girlfriend - 19-year-old Dominique Johnson was arrested on Wednesday and is accused of being an accomplice. Scroll down for video . Jamyra Gallmon, right, has been charged in the stabbing death of a lawyer at an upscale Washington hotel stole just $40 and the victim's Metro SmarTrip card, while Dominique Johnson, left, has been charged with conspiracy to commit armed robbery . She has been charged with conspiracy to commit armed robbery and made an initial appearance in D.C. Superior Court on Thursday during which she denied the charge against her. According to court documents, Johnson was charged because she knew Gallmon was going to rob Messerschmitt. She also allegedly accompanied Gallmon to CVS to buy the zip ties used to tie the victim up. According to documents, after Gallmon returned from the hotel, she told Johnson that the robbery 'went badly.' When Johnson was arrested on Wednesday, she had two Metro cards, including Messerschmitt's card which had been used on April 1. Gallmon has a court hearing scheduled for Friday, but that has now been rescheduled until May 8. She is being held without bond. The woman has admitted to police that she set up the lawyer using a masculine-sounding email address and went to the upscale hotel with the intention of robbing him. Gallmon, who was seen on surveillance camera entering the hotel wearing androgynous clothing, told detectives that the robbery went wrong when Messerschmitt grabbed her arm, causing a flashback to a time when she had been assaulted. The affidavit stated that the pair got into a struggle and the defendant pulled a knife from her pants and stabbed the victim repeatedly until he fell to the floor where she stabbed him several more times. The victim was found with multiple stab wounds to the back, groin and abdomen along with one wound which pierced his heart and another which hit his spinal cord. David Messerschmitt (pictured with his wife Kim) was found dead in his DC hotel room in February. An affidavit revealed that he had been soliciting sex from men through Craigslist . Gallmon was caught on surveillance video entering the hotel where Messerschmitt was killed on February 9 . His hands had been bound with zip-ties into a pair of makeshift cuffs. His hands were covered in defensive wounds. Her attorney asserted in court that it was a case of 'imperfect self-defense.' Court documents concerning a rent dispute confirm Gallmon and Johnson as roomates. About two weeks after Messerschmitt was killed, the two were ordered by a D.C. Superior Court judge to pay $1,860 in rent owed since January. A neighbor of the two women said he was surprised that they could be mixed up in such a crime. 'They were great neighbors. They never made much noise, nothing out of the ordinary. Great people,' Tony Johnson told WUSA9. He said he believed they were also lovers. Messerschmitt had texted his wife Kim Vuong at 7.45pm on February 9 to tell her he would be home in an hour after leaving his law office. He never returned and the next day he was found dead at his hotel room with 'various credit cards strewn about'. He death was declared a homicide. Jamyra Gallmon, 21, (pictured graduating from her military academy high school) has been charged with first-degree felony murder while armed for allegedly stabbing to death 30-year-old David Messerschmitt on February 9 . Among the items recovered from the room were a computer, lubricant, condoms, cell phone and enema kit. Fingerprints were also found in the room. Investigators discovered that Messerschmitt had posted a Craigslist ad on February 9, soliciting responses from other men, using 'dcguy456'. The lawyer began an exchange with an individual, using the name 'chrissanchez0906', around 2pm which continued throughout the day. Messerschmitt told the individual his room number at the hotel and gave a meeting time of 7pm - 7.30pm. The email address that the lawyer had been in contact with was linked to Gallmon. On a search of the woman's DC apartment, police found a knife, black boots and gloves, and a pack of zip ties. A discussion in the comments section of a Queerty.com article about Mr Messerschmitt's murder in February included users referencing interactions with an individual using the handle 'dcguy456'. One commenter said that 'dcguy456' had previously posted on the 'M4M' (men for men) section of Craigslist and identified himself as bisexual. On the left, another view of the security footage of Jamyra Gallmon at the Washington hotel and on the right, Messerschmitt . Emotional: Last month, Messerschmitt's wife, Kim Vuong, held a press conference, asking for help in locating her husband's killer . Another individual's post claimed that he had exchanged emails with 'dcguy456'and met up with him several years ago. Authorities have said they are searching for anyone else who may have e-mailed the account used by Gallmon \u2014 chrissanchez0906@yahoo.com \u2014 but have not said whether anyone has come forward. The new court documents do not say whether anyone else beside Messerschmitt was targeted. Last month, Messerchmitt's wife Kim Vuong gave an emotional speech, asking for help in finding her husband's killer. 'The world has lost a good person. David's family: a son and brother, and I have lost everything: my husband and my best friend. In one day, I lost the most important person in my life and the man I loved so much. And I have no answers,' she said. A Cincinnati native, Messerchmitt attended Ohio State University where he met his wife. He went on to study law at Boston University before working at a firm in Chicago. He then worked at two more firms in the D.C. area before transferring to DLA Piper last year, as a specialist in intellectual property law.",

Moeen is planning to join up with the England squad ahead of the second Test in the Caribbean, starting in Grenada on April 21 \u2013 having recovered more quickly from a rib injury than anyone expected. And he intends to put to good use the experience gained during the World Cup, where he averaged 38 with a strike-rate of 105 \u2013 one of the few glimmers of light in an otherwise benighted tournament for England. Moeen Ali will join up with England ahead of their second West Indies Test after recovering quicker than expected form a rib injury . Moeen's performance in the World Cup was a glimmer of light in a disappointing tournament for England . When the Ashes get going on July 8 Australia will undoubtedly bombard Moeen with bouncers after he found a variety of ways to get out to the short ball against Sri Lanka and India last year \u2013 with Mitchell Johnson and Mitchell Starc ready to unleash merry hell. But Moeen, who was recently named one of Wisden\u2019s Five Cricketers of the Year, said: \u2018It was something I was working on at the World Cup in Australia. And now I\u2019ve tasted a bit of Johnson and Starc and these guys, I feel I\u2019m much more ready than I was last year. It was good for me to see that I can handle that kind of bowling. \u2018I probably thought about the short ball too much in the end, and forgot about the rest of my batting. So I\u2019ve learned from that now, and hopefully I won\u2019t ever do that again.\u2019 Moeen struggled with the short delivery against Sri Lanka and India (pictured) last year . And for those who have not yet erased from their memories Johnson\u2019s demolition job on England\u2019s batsmen during the 5-0 Ashes whitewash in 2013-14, Moeen has some cautionary words. \u2018I think Starc is quicker than Johnson,\u2019 he said. \u2018I think he\u2019ll be more dangerous than him because of the swing. But let\u2019s see what happens. I\u2019ve only faced Johnson once, and that was his first game back, so maybe he\u2019s a bit quicker now.\u2019 Moeen, who hopes to play for Worcestershire against Yorkshire on Sunday in the opening round of County Championship matches, wants to establish himself as the Test team\u2019s No 1 spinner. Moeen says that he worked on facing short deliveries during the World Cup earlier this year . Nineteen wickets at 23 against India last summer was a good start. And he has been working on his doosra, which was briefly unveiled against Sri Lanka at Headingley a year ago, but has remained under wraps during the ICC\u2019s recent purge against dodgy bowling actions. \u2018I feel like I\u2019m bowling it quite well,\u2019 he said. \u2018It wasn\u2019t right at the time, but now that I feel like I\u2019ve got it right. But a lot of players got banned, so I\u2019ve got to err on the careful side of things. I think in the future I\u2019d definitely like to bowl it. \u2018I feel like I\u2019m part of the team now. But I don\u2019t take anything for granted. I still play every game like it\u2019s my first and my last game. I\u2019m looking forward to going out to the West Indies and performing.\u2019",

        "article": "A militant group which opposes both ISIS and the Syrian regime has released a striking video showing off 1,700 troops, fleet of armoured tanks and special forces soldiers in an impressive military parade. These men form a small part of Jaysh Al-Islam - or Army of Islam - who reportedly  command as many as 25,000 loyal fighters following the merger of up to 60 rebel factions inside Syria. Dozens of masked special units show off a range of skills including close-range combat in what the group claims is the 'largest military parade witnessed' since the dawn of the Syrian revolution in 2011. Strength: Four armoured tanks and thousands of soldiers formed part of a graduation ceremony (pictured) held by Jaysh Al-Islam, a militant group that opposes ISIS and the Syrian regime . Aggressive: The soldiers of the Army of Islam perform a series of military drills (pictured) in what the group describes as the 'largest military parade witnessed' since the start of the Syrian revolution . Powerful: The group, who are allegedly being funded by Saudi Arabia, show of a fleet of armoured tanks (pictured) during the graduation ceremony for its recruits . Elite: Its special forces units (pictured) showed off  an array of acrobatic kicks and close-combat skills in front of their leaders . Discipline: As many as 1,700 soldiers stood to attention as their commander referred to them as the 'leaders of the Mujahidin', which roughly translates as 'those who fight in a Jihad' The group operates in the embattled Syrian city of Damascus and their ongoing battle against President Bashar Al-Assad is reportedly funded by the wealthy nation of Saudi Arabia. The Arab kingdom has sent millions of dollars to arm and train their fighters so they can defeat the Syrian regime and 'increasingly powerful Jihadi organisations', according to the Guardian. Known as the Army of Islam, the insurgent group was created in 2011 when Saudi Arabia allegedly engineered the merger of over 50 rebel factions after growing alarmed at the rise if Al-Qaeda and ISIS in Syria. It is a fierce enemy of both those Islamist groups as well as Jabhat Al-Nusra, but embraces independent rebel forces and 'non-Jihadi' units. Their graduation ceremony for  trainee soldiers in the Ghouta suburb of Damascus was attended by the militants' leadership who watch proudly as their troops march in perfect unison across the expanse. Jaysh Al-Islam is led by Sheikh Zahran Aloush who addresses the thousands of armed soldiers and tanks once they have assembled on the vast concrete ground below. Joining forces: Jaysh Al-Islam was formed when up to 60 rebel factions in Syria merged to fight the Syrian regime . Armed: Soldiers rested on the Army of Islam's many tanks (pictured) as their leaders commanded them to 'continue to wage Jihad' Commander: The group is led by\u00a0Sheikh Zahran Aloush (pictured), who is considered one of the most powerful leaders in rebel-held Syria . Fierce: His fighters, who marched in perfect unison in Damascus, are waging a battle against ISIS in Syria and have reportedly attacked their headquarters in the Lebanese city of Arsal . The Salafist leader is considered one of the most power military chiefs in rebel-held Syria and called for the 'cleansing' of all Alawite and Shiites in Damascus. He says to his soldiers: 'Today, legions of Mujahadin, stand in readiness to raise the banner of Allah, uphold his words, move forward to fight and defend his religion. 'Know paradise is waiting for us since we either achieve victory or die in honour... So take your strength from Allah and wage Jihad in the cause of your Lord. 'We will leave these fields in which we finished our course and preparation and we will continue waging Jihad.' He refers to their enemies, which include Islamic State and Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad's troops, as the 'dirtiest and most despicable enemies of Allah'. In February, Aloush tweeted that his insurgents had ambushed Islamic State's fighters at their headquarters in the Lebanese city of Arsal, according to reports by AL Monitor. Might: Their incredible show of strength in their Damascus stronghold of Ghouta included a fleet of armoured tanks . Deadly: That was followed by a series of choreographed drills from its masked special forces units who - unlike their comrades - dressed entirely in black . Force: The graduation ceremony was held for Jaysh Al-Islam's trainee soldiers who stood to attention as fleets of armoured vehicles drove past . They allegedly 'killed and wounded three and took out the eye of a fourth person' in what was reportedly their first act of aggression outside of Syrian territory. His tweets also indicated the group - which is widely known for its links to Saudi Arabia - was prepared to carry out military attacks outside Syria. AL Monitor claimed his tweets referenced ISIS's expansion in the Ghouta and Qalamoun suburbs of Damascus which it controls. He said the attack in Arsal was retaliation for the bombing Islamic State carried out on its headquarters in the Ghouta suburb.",

A man who boasted about plans for an armed robbery on Facebook minutes before he threatened staff in Tesco has been jailed for four years. Andrew Hennells posted details of his plan to the social networking site - stating he was 'Doing. Tesco. Over' at 7.25pm on February 13. A quarter of an hour later, Norfolk Police were alerted by a member of the public to a man brandishing a knife demanding cash from staff working at the supermarket giant's King's Lynn branch. Hennells fled the scene before police arrived, but he was quickly arrested in a nearby pub with \u00a3410 in stolen cash. Norfolk Crown Court heard that officers also recovered a knife. Last month, the 31-year-old, of Gaywood, King's Lynn,admitted\u00a0robbery and carrying a knife as an offence. Sentencing him to four years in prison for armed robbery today, judge Anthony Bate said Hennells posed a 'high risk of serious harm to the public'. The court heard how armed police were deployed after the alarm was raised. Hennells had escaped after stealing a car belonging to a retired couple who had stopped to use a cashpoint. But officers tracked him down in a nearby pub, finding him carrying a knife and \u00a3410 in stolen cash. Another count of robbery relating to the car-jacking was left to lie on file, Norfolk Police said. Outside court, Sgt Pete Jessop, from King's Lynn CID, said that the Facebook confession made it easier to prove the case. Hennells posted this message only 15 minutes before threatening staff at Tesco's in King's Lynn . A member of the public alerted police to a man threatening a member of staff in the store (pictured) Hennells, 31, was then found by police in a nearby pub, with \u00a3410 in cash on his person . Speaking after the first hearing, Sgt Jessop had said: 'We have not got to the bottom of why he posted the pictures and words on Facebook, or why he did the job in the first place. 'It was bizarre and an unusual set of circumstances. 'While the message and pictures on Facebook did not solve the case, it did confirm what we already knew. Hennells held up staff at the Tesco store in King's Lynn, pictured on Friday, February 13 . 'But the thing that made it easier and quicker for us to solve the case was the assistance from the public. 'However, the quickness does not take away from its seriousness or how traumatic it was for the victims of the robbery.' Hennells made a series of other posts to Facebook in the hours before the robbery, including a picture of a large knife, and sharing a Bare Knuckles Gypsies' 'The hardest man in Ireland' video.",

        "article": "A Connecticut judge spared today a father from prison time in the death of the young son he left in a car on a hot day, saying the man had suffered enough. Kyle Seitz, 37, of Ridgefield, received two years of conditional release, a sentence similar to probation, at the hearing in Danbury Superior Court after his lawyer read aloud a letter written by his wife asking the judge for leniency on his behalf. Authorities say Seitz forgot to take his 15-month-old son, Benjamin, to day care on the morning of July 7, 2014, and left him in the car for seven hours while he went to work. Scroll down for video . Spared:\u00a0A Connecticut judge spared Kyle Seitz, pictured in court in November, from prison time in the July death of his 15-month-old son, Benjamin (right) whom he left in a hot car . Temperatures that day soared into the upper 80s. Co-workers at Owl Computer Technologies said Seitz spent the day working as usual, even making a trip in the car to a sandwich shop, not realizing Benjamin was still buckled up in the backseat, according to the arrest warrant. It was not until Seitz drove to his son's day care at the end of the work day to pick him up that he realized Ben was dead in the back of his Jeep Cherokee. The software programmer told the authorities that he 'felt shock and terror' when he discovered that his son was in the back seat 'motionless'. After discovering Benjamin lying unresponsive on the car's back seat, he rushed the toddler to Danbury Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Benjamin died as a result of hyperthermia due to environmental exposure. Just weeks after Benjamin's death, the child's mother said she forgave her husband of 12 years. In anticipation of her husband's sentencing Thursday, Lindsey Rogers-Seitz wrote a letter that was read aloud in court pleading for leniency. Plea for mercy:\u00a0Lindsey Rogers-Seitz (left) had her husband's lawyer read in court a letter she had written to the judge asking him for leniency and compassion for her husband . Daddy's boy:\u00a0Rogers-Seitz wrote that her husband and their son enjoyed a very close bond, and the little boy was the apple of his dad's eye . 'It is with my greatest respect, your honor, that I ask this of you today \u2014 for compassion and leniency in sentencing my husband. For him to be released to be with his family, so that we can finally be at peace to grieve and heal together,' she wrote in the letter read by her attorney. Seitz pleaded guilty March 10 to criminally negligent homicide under an Alford plea, in which he did not admit guilt but agreed the prosecution had enough evidence to convict him at trial. He had been facing up to a year in prison. When asked if he wanted to say a few words, Kyle Seitz thanked all of his family's supporters. 'I cannot punish him more than this event has punished him, nor would I choose to do so,' Judge Kevin Russo said, according to WCBS. Seitz, who has two other children, has been free on bail. His wife and two daughters moved to Colorado following Benjamin's death and Seitz is now free to join them. In the wife's emotional letter, published in full on her personal blog, The Gift of Ben, Lindsey Rodgers-Seitz, a lawyer by trade, wrote that she fell in love with Kyle at first sight, and that the tragedy that rocked their family last year did not change the way she feels about her husband. 'My love for him is based on the fact that he is the most good-hearted, the kindest and most loving man I have ever met,' the wife said in her statement. 'He is not an average father or even a good father\u2026he is an amazing father.' Parent's worst nightmare: Seitz, a software programmer, told the authorities that he 'felt shock and terror' when he discovered that his son was in the back seat 'motionless' She then went on to describe Ben and Kyle's close bond, and how her husband, blessed with what she called a 'magic touch' with kids, would rock his son to sleep and run to him when he cried. 'Ben was a daddy's boy all the way... they were inseparable,' Mrs Roger-Seitz recalled. After explaining her husband's decision to take a plea deal last month - the family sought to avoid a an emotionally draining, drawn-out trial - the grieving wife and mother concluded her blog entry Thursday on a hopeful note. 'My takeaway from all of this, which I hope to guide my life as I move forward is simply - love wins. That's it. Very simple.'",

        "article": "The widow of a cyclist killed after hitting a pothole during a charity ride from Land's End to John O'Groats has won a six-figure payout from the council who failed to mend the road. Martyn Uzzell, 51, died instantly after he was thrown into path of a car by a four-inch deep pothole. Just a month before the tragedy, the council sent workers to inspect the hole after police said it was a hazard. But it was decided that immediate repairs were not necessary. Kate Uzzell has received a six-figure payout after her husband Martyn (both pictured) was killed during a charity cycle ride when he was thrown into the path of a four-inch deep pothole . Tragedy: Experienced cyclist Mr Uzzell, 51, was riding from Land's End to John O'Groats for Macmillan Cancer Support when he died . Coroner Rob Turnbull told Mr Uzzell's inquest last year that there was \u2018no doubt whatsoever that the condition of the road on that occasion was the cause of the incident\u2019. He said the pothole, which surrounded a roadside drain on the A65 near Giggleswick, North Yorkshire, had \u2018existed for some time prior to the accident\u2019. A month before the tragedy in 2011, a traffic policeman saw the hole and his control room alerted their council counterparts, but the alert was not passed on to the highway inspection team. In the following weeks, the council inspected the road twice but failed to take any action before Mr Uzzell cycled along it with two friends raising money for Macmillan Cancer Support. He was flung from his bicycle by the pothole, landing in the path of a car and suffering fatal head injuries. His widow Kate Uzzell, 49, from Clevedon, North Somerset, has now reached an out of court settlement with North Yorkshire County Council. However the local authority is still refusing to apologise for the state of the road in the lead up to the cyclist's death. A coroner previously ruled that the state of the  A65 (pictured), near Giggleswick, North Yorkshire, was 'the cause of the incident' After the inquest last year, Mrs Uzzell said the death of her husband, an experienced cyclist and service engineer, was preventable. She said: 'It is simply disgraceful that a pothole on such a busy road was allowed to go unrepaired. This should not have happened. 'My husband was an experienced cyclist and was out doing what he loved, while raising money for charities close to his heart, but it has cost him his life. The council inspected the pothole in the weeks before Mr Uzzell's (pictured) death but decided it did not need repairing . 'I am told a policeman had reported the pothole on two occasions to the council but nothing was done. The road was also inspected monthly as it is an A-road, but despite the danger being recorded in May it wasn't repaired. 'To make it worse there was another inspection in June carried out in a vehicle going at 25mph down the other side of the three lane carriageway. 'No attempt was made to check an already identified defect, how can this be acceptable? 'Ultimately my husband lost his life because the council did not repair this pothole, despite being warned it was a potential danger, and I would like to know why something wasn't done. 'I do not want anyone else to lose a loved one because the roads have not been properly maintained,' she added. The Crown Prosecution Service concluded the failings by the council should not lead to a corporate manslaughter case or any other charges. Mrs Uzzell said the decision had left her devastated: 'My husband has died yet it seems no one is being held to account as to how this was allowed to happen. 'I have lost my best friend and soul mate, a lovely person, who bought joy to my life, I am now lost and lonely without Martyn. 'And it isn't just me. Martyn's entire family is also suffering the loss of someone very special.' A spokeswoman for North Yorkshire County Council said: 'Whilst North Yorkshire County Council accepts no liability for the tragic death of Mr Uzzell, the authority has appreciated that this is a sensitive matter and has therefore reached a settlement with Mr Uzzell\u2019s widow, to avoid prolonged involvement in further litigation. 'The county council operates a highways maintenance programme that includes a robust system of inspection. 'We continue to maintain and review that inspection regime to ensure the safety of routes for the travelling public.\u2019",

        "article": "A woman is set to marry after falling in love with the driver who crashed into her car while she was parked waiting for her husband to return. Ranette Afonso, 42, will marry Marko Conte, 30, this October after they\u00a0fell head over wheels in love and moved in together within two months of the fateful bump. Ranette, from north London, who has a 21-year-old son and 18-year-old daughter with the husband from whom she is now divorced, said: 'I was waiting for my husband,\u00a0who had popped into the bank, when I noticed a sporty Nissan Skyline trying\u00a0to squeeze into a tiny space behind me. Ranette Afonso, 42 (right), is set to marry Marko Conte, 30 (left), in October after they met thanks to a  car accident in August 2013 . Ranette (pictured left) was married at the time of the accident, but her and Marko (pictured right) began dating shortly after her marriage ended . 'I felt a massive thud and I knew a car had crashed into me - I was\u00a0fuming. 'When Marko stepped out I was angry with him for being so careless. The car\u00a0is his pride and joy so we spent a few minutes arguing with each other\u00a0about who was to blame. 'At the same time, I found him really attractive and as we swapped\u00a0insurance and contact details - I could somehow tell the feeling was mutual.' Ranette's 20-year marriage was already coming to an end by the\u00a0time Marko unexpectedly came into her life at the end of August 2013. Ranette, a laywer, said: 'We had been together for a long time, but we had reached the\u00a0end of our marriage. We both knew it. 'As I drove back home with my husband beside me I couldn't get Marko out of my mind. Five days after the incident I sent him an email asking how is bumper was and, before I knew it, we were texting each other regularly. Marko's car suffered notable damage after crashing into Ranette's parked car back in August 2013 . After the accident, the pair exchanged insurance and contact details and began to text regularly . 'I soon discovered that we had so much in common and, as things were not going so well between my husband, I found myself drifting closer and closer towards Marko.' Two days later Marko was surprised when Ranette sent him a text telling him she had suddenly split from her husband. Marko, a car hire company owner, invited her to stay with him while she made arrangements for her new life. He said: 'It was completely unexpected.\u00a0After she arrived on my doorstep we had one of the best weekends of my life. 'There was so much passion between us - I knew we had a connection. We're\u00a0both passionate people.' Ranette eventually moved in with her sister but still saw Marko frequently on dates. And they continued sending each other flirty texts using the contact numbers\u00a0they had swapped for insurance purposes. Lawyer Ranette Afonso, 42 (pictured) was married at the time of the accident, but had been growing apart from her first husband of 20 years . On the couple's third date, Marko (pictured left) surprised Ranette (pictured right) by asking her to marry him . On their third date, just two months after the smash, Marko surprised Ranette by asking her to marry him. She said: 'We were having an incredible time in the nightclub and\u00a0then - when I least expected it - Marko popped the big question and asked\u00a0me to marry him. 'My initial response was 'did he actually say that?' I thought that he was\u00a0trying to see my reaction. 'But when I discovered that it was a genuine proposal, I didn't think twice\u00a0about saying \"yes\". 'Sometimes you just know when something feels right and that was definitely\u00a0one of those moments.' Wild ride: Ranette is pictured sitting in the very same car that Marko crashed, which underwent a green paint-job following the accident . The pair moved in together in October\u00a02013 and Ranette's divorce from her ex-husband was finalised two months\u00a0later. She said: 'My close family want me to be happy so they have\u00a0supported my decision to marry Marko. 'My friends thought I was crazy - particularly as it happened so fast - but\u00a0now they understand.' Marko said: 'Everything has happened so quick. It's been such a crazy\u00a0ride. At first I thought it was going to be casual but I am glad that we're\u00a0now engaged. The happy pair, from Edmonton Green, north London, were engaged just two months after the car accident and are hoping to get married this October . 'We have found something really special.' Ranette said: 'I am so happy that Marko crashed in to me on that day. 'Both of our birthdays are in October so we're hoping that we can get\u00a0married then. 'It will be the first time for me to finally meet Marko's family from Italy\u00a0so it will definitely be an exciting occasion.' He said: 'We haven't made any honeymoon plans just yet but we are\u00a0planning to travel the world, from Italy to South Africa.'",

        "article": "Poland said it is demanding a formal apology from the U.S. over the comments made by FBI director James Comey (pictured above) The US ambassador for Poland has been forced to apologise for comments made by the head of the FBI who blamed Polish people for helping the Nazis kill Jews during the Holocaust. James Coney had written an editorial opinion piece for the Washington Post claiming Poland shares responsibility for the Holocaust with Germany. The piece sparked outrage among Polish politicians and media. US Ambassador Stephen Mull met with the Polish deputy foreign affairs minister and apologised for the comments. He said:\u00a0'I made clear that the opinion that Poland is in any way responsible for the Holocaust is not the position of the United States. 'Nazi Germany alone bears responsibility.' Mr Mull said he now had 'a lot of work' to do to rectify the situation. Comey's April 16 opinion piece in the Washington Post\u00a0stated that Poland played a role in Nazi Germany's genocide of six million European Jews in the Holocaust. 'In their minds, the murderers and accomplices of Germany, and Poland, and Hungary, and so many, many other places didn't do something evil,' Comey wrote. The piece was titled\u00a0Why I require FBI agents to visit the Holocaust Museum. 'They convinced themselves it was the right thing to do, the thing they had to do,' it continues. Scroll down for video . Poland's president Bronislaw Komorowski told public television that Comey's comments showed a 'lack of historical knowledge' and were an 'insult to thousands of Poles who helped Jews'. On Sunday foreign ministry spokesman Marcin Wojciechowski wrote on Twitter that Mull would 'receive a note of protest and a summons for an apology.' US Ambassador Stephen Mull apologised to Poland . The US Ambassador was quick to present an informal apology at memorial ceremonies in the Polish capital on Sunday marking the 72nd anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. Six million Polish citizens were killed under Nazi Germany's occupation of Poland during World War II. While half of the victims were Jewish, the other half were Christian. Historical records show instances of Poles turning against their Jewish neighbours, either killing them or giving them up to the Nazis. Poles also risked their lives and families to save Jews. In 2012, US President Barack Obama caused outrage in Warsaw when he labelled a World War II Nazi German facility in occupied Poland used to process Jews for extermination a 'Polish death camp'. He subsequently expressed 'regret' at what he called his inadvertent use of the erroneous term 'Polish death camp.' Poland's government keenly watches the global media for descriptions of former Nazi German death camps as 'Polish. It says the term - even if used simply as a geographical indicator - can give the impression that Poland bore responsibility for the Holocaust.

Known as an earworm or brainworm, the effect has been studied before - but its cause, and how to get rid of it, is poorly understood. Now researchers say they have an answer; chewing gum after hearing a catchy song will help you think about it less often. Reading scientists say chewing gum helps you forget a song. In a study people were less likely to think about it when chewing (stock image shown). And they were a third less likely to 'hear' it when chewing gum. The results suggests same technique could stop other intrusive thoughts . The study was carried out by scientists at the University of Reading.

The Villarreal defender was carried off on a stretcher with 13 minutes to go after his ankle appeared to buckle when he was  running for the ball. The Argentine underwent a successful operation after being taken to hospital, where he was diagnosed with a broken left ankle. Villarreal's Mateo Musacchio runs for the ball near the touchline with 13 minutes left to play . As he closes in on the ball and the sliding opponent, his right foot is bent back, breaking his ankle . Musacchio crumples to the ground in agony after the horrendous ankle break . 'Musacchio has been successfully operated on tonight at the Cemtro Clinic in Madrid after having a dislocation and break of his left ankle,' read a statement on Villarreal's website. 'The recovery time for the footballer will depend on the progress he makes.' An Ikechukwu Uche penalty, after he himself was fouled by Medhi Lacen with 52 minutes played, was Villarreal's first goal in five league games but it was not enough to give them their first La Liga away win of the year. In a scrappy game Getafe deservedly drew level with a fine header from Castro after 64 minutes and Pedro Leon had the chance to win the game but his shot following a breakaway was parried by Villarreal keeper Sergio Asenjo. Villarreal have failed to win in seven games in all competitions and are sixth on 51 points. Getafe are 13th on 36 points.

Before last year's historic vote, Scottish nationalists insisted it was a once-in-a-generation chance to decided on the future of the 300-year-old Union. But Ms Sturgeon today refused to rule out demanding a re-run within the next five years, prompting opponents to claim she had 'broken a promise the size of Ben Nevis'. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon today refused to rule out demanding a re-run within the next five years, prompting opponents to claim she had 'broken a promise the size of Ben Nevis' In September's vote, 55 per cent of Scots backed the idea of remaining in the United Kingdom. Alex Salmond said the vote was an 'opportunity of a lifetime' and two years ago, Miss Sturgeon said of the independence vote: 'We have always said it's a once in a generation thing.' But in a series of TV election debates between Scottish leaders, Ms Sturgeon has shifted her position and today left open the possibility that the promise of another vote could be included in a future SNP manifesto. Under pressure she said that 'something would have to change' before she promised a referendum, and people would have to vote for it. She said: 'I am not planning another referendum right now, there is not another referendum on the cards. 'In order for another referendum to be in an SNP manifesto in future, something significant would have to change from the situation we had last year in the referendum.' Ms Sturgeon, who was campaigning in Paisley today, left open the idea of demanding a referendum in next year's Scottish Parliament elections . Opponents claim Ms Sturgeon had 'broken a promise the size of Ben Nevis' on a referendum, after insisting last year's vote was a once in a generation event . During a fractious and at times shouty debate on BBC Sunday Politics Scotland, Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson challenged her to rule out another vote. Ms Davidson, leader of the Scottish Conservatives, added: 'You clearly don't want to tell people before they vote in this election, what will happen in the next election. 'You have a conference coming up in September, you have 80,000 new members who might be popping along, are you going to put a motion at your conference on this to put a referendum into your next manifesto?' Ms Sturgeon said: 'I am not planning another referendum right now, I haven't published the 2016 manifesto. It will be this time next year before we publish the 2016 one.' Mr Rennie said the SNP leader had 'broken a promise the size of Ben Nevis' on another referendum. He said: 'People need to know whether their vote for the SNP this time round will trigger a referendum in the SNP's manifesto in 2016. Nicola Sturgeon's refusal to answer this basic question makes clear that Scotland faces neverendum. 'It matters because during the referendum we know the SNP took their eye off the ball. As a result, public services were neglected. 'We have seen from Canada the economic impact of an uncertain constitutional environment. Quebec lost jobs and wealth. That damaged the province in the long term. I want a Scotland which builds a stronger economy and a fairer society, balancing the books and delivering more powers.' During a TV debate, Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy and Tory leader Ruth Davidson challenged Ms Sturgeon to come clean on her plans for Scotland . Ms Sturgeon later accused her opponents of 'reviving Project Fear'. The First Minister was questioned about SNP plans to increase Scotland's financial powers, which economists have suggested would leave a \u00a37.6 billion spending gap, during a third televised election debate in under a week. Ms Sturgeon said that full fiscal autonomy would take several years to implement but with new powers Scotland would start growing its economy and revenues. She said: 'This week we've seen the Project Fear that dominated the referendum revived by these three unionist parties, trying to talk down Scotland and assert that we're not capable of running our own affairs.' Scottish Conservatives leader Ruth Davidson said: 'This (the figure) didn't come from us. You're right in saying this came from the Institute for Fiscal Studies. It also came from a group of Scottish-based economists that projected the gap to be bigger.' Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy said: 'To make this \u00a37.6 billion up Scotland would have to grow at twice the rate of the rest of entire advanced world, so how would you do that Nicola?'",

        "article": "The news that Jurgen Klopp will leave Borussia Dortmund in the summer has raised the probability that key members of his squad will depart too. Klopp has painstakingly built a team in his image during his seven-year tenure at the Westfalenstadion and achieved considerable success. Dortmund were Bundesliga champions in 2011 and 2012 before they reached the final of the Champions League in 2013. Jurgen Klopp has announced he is to quit Borussia Dortmund at the end of the season . Klopp has enjoyed seven successful seasons at the Westfalenstadion but has decided to call time . But the signings of Mario Gotze and Robert Lewandowski helped Bayern Munich re-establish their dominance and Klopp's exit is the end of an era. It could signal the break-up of the Dortmund squad and we take a look at four players who could follow Klopp out of the club this summer. MATS HUMMELS . Even before Klopp's shock announcement, it looked highly likely that Hummels would be leaving at the end of the season, most likely to Manchester United. The Germany World Cup-winner is considered one of the best defenders in the game and would add steel to any back line. Klopp revealed recently that Hummels, 26, had been 'thinking things over,' adding that he believed he was good enough for United. Defender Mats Hummels has been linked with a move to Manchester United this summer . ILKAY GUNDOGAN . The 24-year-old midfielder has also been linked with a summer move to the Premier League, with Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester City among those interested. At his best, Gundogan can take control of a midfield battle and is more than capable of unlocking defences with his range of passing. He hinted in February that he was ready to sign a new contract but then stalled and Klopp's departure could make up his mind for him. Midfielder Ilkay Gundogan has been linked with a number of Premier League sides . CIRO IMMOBILE . The Italian striker only arrived at the Westfalenstadion from Torino last summer but hasn't lived up to expectations as Lewandowski's replacement. A measly return of 10 goals for the season has hardly compensated for the loss of their star striker to Bayern last summer. There have been suggestions that Dortmund will listen to offers for Immobile and he would most likely return home to Italy, perhaps to AC Milan. Ciro Immobile (left) has struggled to compensate for Robert Lewandowski's departure to Bayern Munich . NEVEN SUBOTIC . The Serbian defender had ears burning in the Premier League when he said last week that he won't decide his Dortmund future until after his summer holidays. He also added they he yearns to play in a league that is more physical, saying: 'How can I do my work when my opponent starts crying without contact?' Subotic has been linked with Manchester United and Arsenal, offering a possible alternative if Hummels doesn't want to make the move. Defender Neven Subotic celebrates scoring in the German Cup quarter-final with Hoffenheim .",

        "article": "The 12-year-old daughter of the mailman who landed his gyrocopter on the lawn of the U.S. Capitol last week has said she was 'downright proud' of her dad. 'He's a patriot you know?' Kathy Hughes told ABC News. 'He did it for the country.' Her father, 61-year-old Doug Hughes, landed the aircraft on the West Lawn last Wednesday to protest campaign finance laws but was swiftly taken into custody. He is now under house arrest at their Ruskin, Florida home as he awaits a hearing to determine if he will go on trial for crossing a no-fly zone, a charge that could send him to prison for four years. On Monday, Hughes called his 80-mile journey to the Capitol 'a huge thrill' and shared footage of the flight from Virginia, across Washington D.C. and his safe landing on the West Lawn. Scroll down for video . Proud: Kathy Hughes, 12, said she is 'downright proud' of her father, who was arrested after landing his gyrocopter on the West lawn of the U.S. Capitol last week to protest corruption in Congress . Speaking out: Doug Hughes said the journey from Virginia to the U.S. Capitol was a 'huge thrill' as he spoke to Good Morning America on Monday morning. He is currently under house arrest in Florida . Journey: He also shared  footage (pictured) of his 80-mile flight from Virginia and across D.C. Speaking to\u00a0Good Morning America on Monday morning, Hughes said he never feared he would be shot down, despite coming within feet of the guarded building. 'I'm a mailman, I was delivering the mail,' he said wryly. 'I don't think that the government is going to shoot a 61-year-old mailman in a flying bicycle who is not threatening anyone.' He added that he had made 'every effort to notify the administration' before his flight to let them know who he was and what he would be doing. Instead of worrying about being shot down, he was focused solely on landing safely, he said. 'This is different than any other landing I've made, and it had a very surreal nature to it,' he said. 'I didn't have a hand free to pinch myself to see if it was happening, but that\u2019s what was happening.' Despite landing unscathed, he said that he believes the security in the city is 'ironclad' and that if anyone else tries to land on the West Lawn, they might not be so lucky. He pulled off the stunt to bring the public's attention to the 'the problem of corruption in Congress' and to spotlight his belief that campaign finance laws are too weak, he said. 'It's up to the American people to decide whether or not they're going to catch the ball that I threw,' he said. 'If they pick this up, it's in their power to fix the problem. Then it's worth it even if I lose my job or go to jail.' He is also calling for changes to Congress on his blog. By his side: Both Kathy and her mother Alena (right) have called Mr Hughes a 'patriot' for his flight . Hughes is on leave from his job and is under house arrest in Ruskin, Florida. He will attend a hearing in Washington D.C. in two weeks to determine whether his case will go to trial. If found guilty of the charges - violating restricted airspace and operating an unregistered aircraft - he faces four years in prison and fines. Speaking to GMA, he added that he does not expect to be reunited with his gyrocopter, but if he does, he plans to melt it down into beer cans. Hughes reportedly planned his trip for more than two years before flying through restricted airspace and a no-fly zone last Wednesday. He was carrying 535 letters - one for each member of Congress. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson later admitted that the gyrocopter went undetected and under the radar as it flew 80 miles from Gettysburg, Pennsylvania to the building - in just the latest embarrassment for Secret Service security around the Capitol and White House. After a series of interviews, the Secret Service decided not to prosecute Mr Hughes' Belarus-born wife Alena, who claims she was not aware of his plan. Approach: The small gyro-copter (in red) lands on the West Lawn of the Capitol in Washington last week . Under the radar:\u00a0A member of a bomb squad checks the small helicopter after Hughes landed on the West Lawn of the Capitol in Washington last Wednesday. He was carrying letters to every member of Congress . The couple met online and went on a few dates in Russia before she moved to the U.S. in 2002 and they married. Kathy is their daughter together while Mr Hughes has adult children from a previous marriage. She reportedly told officers that her husband said he was going to Virginia but did not elaborate on what he planned to do there. But following his stunt, Mrs Hughes defended her husband as a 'patriot'. 'I am very proud of my husband. He is a countryman,' Alena Hughes told the Associated Press. But for his part, when Mr Hughes was asked if he defined himself as a patriot, he responded: 'No, I'm a mailman.' See below for video .",

        "article": "Arsene Wenger admits he is concerned Theo Walcott\u2019s confidence is plummeting after his struggles with England this week. The Arsenal manager will have a heart-to-heart chat with the forward ahead of Saturday\u2019s crunch top-four clash against Liverpool. Walcott was hauled off after 55 minutes of England\u2019s 1-1 draw in Italy on Tuesday night. Theo Walcott struggled for England and Arsene Wenger admits he is concerned by the winger's confidence . Walcott was replaced by Ross Barkley after just 55 minutes of England's 1-1 draw against Italy on Tuesday . 2 -\u00a0Premier League goals for Walcott this season - his average haul per season during his time at Arsenal is 5.6. It was the latest disappointment in a difficult season for the 26-year-old, who has struggled for game time since returning from a long-term lay-off due to a serious knee injury. With Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain out of Liverpool\u2019s visit due to a hamstring strain, and Danny Welbeck a major doubt after sustaining a knee problem on international duty, Walcott could start on Saturday. But Wenger said: \u2018Yes, I\u2019m worried about Theo\u2019s confidence. He\u2019s sensitive and I\u2019m a bit concerned about the damage that game can have on his mind. Walcott could face Liverpool on Saturday with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain injured and Danny Welbeck a doubt . \u2018He\u2019s not completely there yet (after the injury). But being exposed like that, people have a harsh judgement on him that is not deserved because he does well. \u2018At the moment he is frustrated, but that is normal. I will speak with him, but I think he is strong enough. \u2018I will see what state of mind he is in. We always have a word, if it is a positive experience or a negative experience, you ask \u201chow did it go?\u201d. We always speak about the last game. \u2018He is not fragile mentally, he is strong mentally but he is disappointed because when you come back from an injury you always think you are ready. \u2018He needs patience. He is at the moment not in his best mood. \u2018He has big confidence in himself and he has gone through some difficult periods in his life and he has always come out with strength.\u2019 Arsenal boss Wenger says he will speak with Walcott but believes the Gunners winger is 'strong enough' Walcott found himself playing in the No 10 role for England in Turin \u2014 a role he is not accustomed to. And Wenger admitted he was surprised to see the pacy forward in such an unfamiliar position. \u2018Have I ever seen him play No 10 in training or anything? No,\u2019 said Wenger. \u2018Theo\u2019s strength is the quality of his movements, he wants to go to get on the end of things. He\u2019s not a guy who provides. \u2018I don\u2019t think it was the intention of Roy Hodgson to play him there. It\u2019s maybe because Wayne Rooney took the initiative during the game to play higher up and tell Theo to drop back. \u2018I didn\u2019t see Roy Hodgson in the game stand up to say \u201cWalcott, you come and play in midfield and Rooney you go up front\u201d. That\u2019s an initiative they took on the pitch.\u2019 Walcott aims a shot at goal during England's friendly against Italy at the Juventus Stadium in Turin . Walcott was starting his first international game in 18 months having injured his cruciate ligaments . Meanwhile, Wenger insists there are fundamental flaws in FA chairman Greg Dyke\u2019s proposal to increase the number of required homegrown players in Premier League squads to 12. Dyke believes increasing the number of British players in squads will help contribute to a more successful England team. But Wenger said: \u2018I believe we are in a top level competition and you earn your right through the quality of your performance rather than your place of birth. \u2018Secondly, I\u2019m happy to, and would like to contribute to the quality of the English national team, but you have two questions you can raise before that. \u2018First of all between 1966 and 1996 there were no foreign players in England and it didn\u2019t improve too much the performances of the national team. \u2018Secondly, if between the ages of 16 and 21 the England youth teams win every single competition in Europe then there is something we have to do because they are not getting their chance at the top level. Wenger believes there are flaws in FA Chairman Greg Dyke\u2019s proposal to increase the homegrown quota . \u2018That is not the case, on the contrary. I think between 16 and 21 the English youth teams, until now, have not performed. So that\u2019s the heart of the problem. \u2018Let\u2019s get better at that level, then if there is a problem integrating these players in the top teams, we have to do something about it. \u2018I think today you have to be very brave to integrate young players in the top teams because the pressure is very high. I still believe when they are good enough, they play. \u2018You speak about Raheem Sterling and Harry Kane. Nobody stops the quality, no matter where they are from. So let\u2019s focus on that first.\u2019",

        "article": "SpaceX has released dramatic footage of its third attempt to land a rocket booster on a barge in the Atlantic. The video, taken from a plane yesterday, shows the Falcon 9 booster lowering itself onto the platform, before a gust of wind sways it to one side. The 14-storey booster manages to hit the barge, but its high speed and tilt causes it to explode on impact. Scroll down for video . SpaceX has released dramatic footage of its third attempt to land a rocket booster on a drone barge in the Atlantic Ocean . The maneuver was attempted following the launch of the Falcon 9 rocket a few minutes earlier from Cape Canaveral in Florida. Soon after the launch, billionaire SpaceX founder, Elon Musk, tweeted: 'Ascent successful. Dragon enroute to Space Station. Rocket landed on droneship, but too hard for survival.' Landing the rocket upright was always going to be tricky. SpaceX once compared it to balancing a broomstick on your hand. The autonomous spaceport drone ship is 300ft by 100ft (90 by 30 metres), with wings that extend its width to 170ft (50 metres). Musk had put 50-50 odds on the attempt being successful and said that improvements to the design would happen throughout the year. The video, taken from a plane yesterday, shows the the Falcon 9 booster lowering itself onto the platform, before a gust of wind sways it to one side . The booster manages to hit the barge, but its high speed and tilt creates a huge explosion on impact . United Launch Alliance has unveiled radical plans to launch a reusable rocket named 'Vulcan' in 2019. Vulcan will use new engines, mid-air recovery and a new upper stage aimed at enabling complex on-orbit manoeuvres. The company appears to have timed the announcement to overshadow SpaceX' launch of Falcon 9, which today hoped to prove that reusable rockets are viable. The aim of both SpaceX and ULA is to end US dependence on Russian-built rocket engines, but the technology has so far proven difficult. ULA's plan is to skip returning the whole booster, an approach favoured by rival SpaceX. It hopes to separate the engines after launch, inflate a heat shield around them and dispatch a helicopter to nab them mid-air. Despite being destroyed, the booster's flyback marks another step in the company's quest to develop rockets that can be refurbished and reflown, potentially slashing launch costs. 'This might change completely how we approach transportation to space,' SpaceX Vice President Hans Koenigsman told reporters during a prelaunch press conference. The Falcon 9 is on now its way to deliver 4,300lb (1,950 kg) of food, clothing and science experiments to the ISS - including an eagerly awaited espresso machine for astronauts. The supplies should arrive the six space station astronauts on Friday. The rocket was was due to take off yesterday, but the launch was  scrubbed due to bad weather. On board the Dragon capsule is an experimental espresso machine intended for International Space Station astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti of Italy. The Italians in charge of the project hope to revolutionise coffee-drinking in space. SpaceX, meanwhile, hoped to transform the rocket business by landing the first-stage booster on a platform floating a few hundred miles off Florida's northeastern coast, near Jacksonville. The booster managed to land on the barge but Elon Musk said that 'excess lateral velocity' caused it to tip over . Elon Musk tweeted this image of the booster coming back down to Earth. Musk had put 50-50 odds on the attempt being successful and said that improvements to the design would happen throughout the year . The booster was programmed, following separation 2.5 minutes after liftoff, to flip around and fly to the platform dubbed 'Just Read the Instructions' in the Atlantic ocean . Musk's plan is to reuse his booster rockets rather than discard them as is the custom around the world, to reduce launch costs. First-stage boosters normally just slam into the Atlantic and sink. The booster was programmed, following separation 2.5 minutes after liftoff, to flip around and fly to the platform dubbed 'Just Read the Instructions.' The Dragon \u2014 the only supply ship capable of returning items intact \u2014 will remain at the space station until around May 21. During a previous landing attempt in January, the rocket ran out of hydraulic fluid for its steering fins, causing it to crash into the platform. A second attempt in February was called off because of high seas, but the rocket successfully ran through its pre-programmed landing sequence and hovered vertically above the waves before splashing down and breaking apart. At liftoff time, the orbiting lab was soaring over Australia. The delivery of food and equipment will arrive Friday . The launch sequence as it happened. All stages of the launch went to plan, except for the landing of the lower part of the rocket.\u00a0SpaceX once compared it to balancing a broomstick on your hand . Musk recently unveiled the images of the Falcon 9 failed second landing after persuasion on Twitter by the game pioneer behind Doom, John Carmack. The ISSpresso machine uses a normal Lavazza coffee capsule, which is posted in the top of the machine. Water is aspirated and pressurised in a unique electrical system and is then heated. The granules mix with the hot water and the coffee is piped into a pouch, which is securely fastened to the machine using a 'rapid coupling/uncoupling system.' Astronauts drink the coffee straight from the pouch using a straw. The images show the rocket approaching the barge following last month's attempt. After it fails to reduce its speed, the rocket is seen crashing at an angle and exploding. Billionaire Musk described the event simply as a 'rapid unscheduled disassembly'. This is the California-based SpaceX company's seventh station supply run since 2012, all from Cape Canaveral. SpaceX is one of two companies hired by Nasa to fly cargo to the station following the retirement of the space shuttles. As well as a recently extended 15-flight, $2 billion contract with Nasa, SpaceX is working on a passenger version of the Dragon capsule and has dozens of contracts to deliver commercial communications satellites into orbit. The company also is working on a heavy-lift version of the Falcon rocket, which uses 27 engines, compared to the nine currently flying.

        "article": "A celebrated Texas-born hunter was crushed to death by a baby elephant in Zimbabwe as he tried to measure its ivory tusks for an American client. Ian Gibson, 55, was a lauded figure among U.S. safari enthusiasts, who would commission him to slaughter prized animals near his home in South Africa. On Wednesday, he was tentatively approaching the young bull elephant in Zimbabwe's Zambezi Valley when the animal charged, and knelt on Gibson until he died. Crushed to death: Ian Gibson, 55, was killed by a young bull elephant while measuring its ivory for a U.S. client . His American client, who was also present, has not been identified. The Dallas Safari Club is paying for Gibson's funeral. Despite only having one leg, Gibson was described by fans as 'fit and strong'. According to a statement from Safari Classics, posted on AfricaHunting.com, the group had stopped for a rest when the animal approached their group. Gibson and his tracker approached to assess its ivory. 'At very close range, Ian was able to get off one shot before the bull killed him. The scene was very graphic,' the statement read. Twitter users were widely pitiless, with hundreds of animal rights supporters commenting that he 'got what he deserved'. Lauded figure: Gibson, who lived in South Africa, was a popular figure in the U.S. safari enthusiast community . Backlash: Twitter users have been widely unsympathetic to Gibson's death in Zimbabwe on Wednesday . Tributes posted on the hunting forum slammed unsympathetic reactions to Gibson's death, describing the big game hunter as a 'magnificent wildlife photographer and conservationist.' According to friends, he fired one shot at the young bull elephant, who was going through 'musth' - a period of high testosterone. The animal then charged. Gibson's trackers wrote on AfricaHunting.com: 'We know 'Gibbo' shot it once, from about 10 yards away, with a 458 [rifle]. 'He would never have fired unless he had no alternative. He was a hunter, yes, but he was also a magnificent wildlife photographer and conservationist. Prized: Ivory tusks are some of the most prized treasures hunters can get, enraging animal rights supporters . 'He was so experienced and this is a most unexpected tragedy.' The news has come a month after a study was released warning that ivory hunting is continuing to diminish the elephant population in Africa. A report by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, which is known as CITES and regulates wildlife trade, said poaching rates of elephants in areas that are being monitored still exceed their natural birth rates. Conservationists say tens of thousands of elephants have been killed in Africa in recent years as demand for ivory in Asia, particularly China, increases. Past estimates of Africa's elephant population have ranged from 420,000 to 650,000. Prince William is one of the world's most prominent voices in defense of elephants against ivory hunters.",

The hometown of Stephanie Scott has paid tribute to the much-loved teacher by filling the sky with brightly coloured hot-air balloons in a spectacular display. As the balloons hovered above the small community of Canowindra in the central west region of NSW, hundreds gathered on Sunday morning to mark the tragic death of the bride-to-be. More than a dozen hot-air balloons took to the skies as hundreds of yellow helium balloons were released in the town where the 26-year-old grew up and met her fiance Aaron Leeson Woolley. \u2018When we heard about Stephanie we decided to have a tribute. We had people here from France, Russia and Canada - they joined in because they could see our pain,\u2019 event organiser Jan Kerr said.\u00a0\u2018It was magic to see.\u2019 Orange resident Mark Andrew, who travelled to Canowindra on Sunday to pay his respects to the murdered teacher said it was a beautiful opportunity to honour Ms Scott. 'It was a surreal start to a sad and poignant day,' Mr Andrew told Daily Mail Australia. 'The only sounds were those of the burners on the balloons as they prepared to take off. The moment of take off was quite profoundly emotional. 'The silent gathering was akin to that at the ANZAC dawn service which is topical.' Scroll down for video . More than a dozen hot-air balloons took to the skies in Stephanie Scott's hometown Canowindra on Sunday morning . The town paid tribute to the much-loved teacher by filling the sky with brightly coloured hot-air balloons and smaller yellow balloons . The latest tribute comes just one week after Ms Scott was murdered and dumped in bushland six days before she was due to walk down the aisle to marry her partner of five years. Family and friends of the pair had flown from around the world to attend their big day, but are now bracing themselves to attend her funeral. Efforts to find out exactly what happened to Stephanie are continuing with forensic specialists expected to carry out a post-mortem on the body on Monday. The burned remains were found by police just five metres from a road in the Cocoparra National Park in the NSW Riverina region at about 5pm on Friday. A source told AAP that police believe Ms Scott was dead before she reached the bushland. Scores of hot-air balloons flooded the sky above the 26-year-old's birthplace . Hometown of Ms Scott paid tribute to the murdered teacher with a stunning hot-air balloon display . Balloons hovering above Ms Scott's hometown, where hundreds gathered to mourn the tragic death of the 26-year-old school teacher . School cleaner Vincent Stanford, who moved to Leeton from The Netherlands over a year ago with his mother and brother, was charged with her murder. The 24-year-old was charged after police allegedly found a camera with images of a burned body and blood in his white Toyota Hilux on Wednesday night. NSW police are reportedly expected to make inquiries with their counterparts in the Netherlands as part of their investigation into Stephanie's death. In the wake of the English and drama teacher's alleged murder, her workplace has become a makeshift shrine with yellow flowers, balloons and messages building by the day. She spent most of her life growing up in Canowindra where she also met her partner of five years Aaron Leeson Woolley . Stephanie Scott pictured with her fianc\u00e9 Aaron Leeson-Woolley, was last seen on Easter Sunday just days before her wedding . Hundreds gathered on Sunday to honour the much-loved school teacher as dozens of balloons were launched into the sky . Brightly coloured hot-air balloons flew through the sky . Several balloons hovered above the small community on Sunday . Her family returned to the school memorial on Sunday, as they have each day since the tragedy, to read tributes left by mourners. Investigators were reportedly led to the bushland where Stephanie's body was found by triangulating off Stanford's mobile phone and with the help of Stanford's mother and brother. It is understood Stanford went on regular camping trips to the national park where the body was found and had spent many a lot of time there in the past. Over the weekend Ms Scott's body was transported to the Glebe morgue in Sydney and is expected to undergo a post-mortem on Monday morning. Loved ones released yellow balloons into the air at the picnic to commemorate the life of Ms Scott . Hundreds of yellow balloons were released in memory of Ms Scott, a much-loved school teacher who was due to be married on Saturday . 'Stephanie was a bright, intelligent and fun-loving woman,' Mr Scott said at his daughter's memorial service on Saturday . The hot-air balloon event comes just a day after Ms Scott's family, fiance and friends held a heart-wrenching memorial service at a park for the bride-to-be on what was meant to be her happiest day on Saturday. Her fiance sobbed into his hands on the same day he was meant to watch his wife-to-be walk down the aisle towards him at a country wedding but instead, he released yellow balloons for his slain partner. While her father Robert Scott gave a moving tribute in front of those who knew the beloved teacher on behalf of his family and friends at Mountford Park in Leeton. Hundreds donned yellow as they gathered in a park at Leeton as her father asked the supportive community to remember Ms Scott as the 'bright, bubbly, intelligent and fun-loving' woman she was.

The chilling footage was posted on Facebook and shows the cab throwing 25-year-old Kadeem Brown across a median in the Bronx, New York. The conditions were so\u00a0icy\u00a0at the time he slid into the opposite curb before coming to a stop. His green taxi struck and killed  little Tierre Clark who was five. She was waiting with her mother at a bus stop when she was hit by the cab. WARNING GRAPHIC IMAGES .

Shocking:  Brown can be seen laying on the ground as horrified onlookers attempt to summon help . 'Accident happened at 170 and Grand Concourse in front of my bodega,' Facebook user Junior Papi Sanchez posted online. Police say Emilo Garcia, the 44-year-old driver, suffered a seizure moments before the crash on Friday evening. Despite the impact, he reportedly continued driving another 100 feet or so, before jumping a curb and crashing into the group waiting at the bus stop. He finally smashed into the side of a building. Mr Brown died at the scene, while the little girl who is not featured in the video died a short time later. Garcia has since had his TLC license taken away but has not been not been charged with any crime. Gone too soon: Kadeem Brown, 25, was killed . 'A state and city licensed driver has killed two people in broad daylight,' said Charles Komanoff of the safe street group Right of Way. 'The public has every right to demand that everything about the crash and the driver be dug up and made public.' A memorial service was held for Brown Wednesday evening at Mount Carmel Pentecostal Church, and he will be buried Thursday morning. Grieving relatives and friends of Brown posted memories of him on a fundraising page for his family. 'I always admired him, and said that's how our young men should act and carry themselves,' wrote his friend's aunt Tia Linder. 'He was destined for greatness, but God had a much higher calling for him. You can tell a person's true character by what others say about them when they are no longer here.' Another pal wrote that he was always the first friend to wish her a happy birthday.

        "article": "On first glance they appear to simply be bland, bleach-white seashells, but when viewed under ultraviolet light they are transformed. Scientists have used a new technique to reconstrcut the colourful patterns on 28 fossilised cone snail shells that are up to 6.6 million years old. The technique has allowed researchers to look millions of years into the past to see how these once elaborately decorated shells would have once looked. The fossilised cone snail shells have bleached over time, like the one labelled A, but under ultraviolet light traces of pigment still in the shells are revealed, labelled B, allowing their colours to be reconstrcuted (C) Instead of being a simple white colour, they were infact covered in streaks of orange, purple, blue and even large pokadots. The scientists now believe the cone snail shells, which come from the northern Dominican Republic, include 13 entirely new species. A deadly tropical sea snail uses a super-potent form of insulin to subdue its fish prey, scientists have discovered. The geographic cone snail (Conus geographus) uses the chemical to cause a plunge in blood sugar, leaving the fish sluggish and unable to swim to safety. In this way the snail is able to entrap whole schools of small fish. C. geographus is one of the most venomous creatures on Earth, and known to have killed dozens of people in accidental encounters. It hunts in two ways, both by releasing toxins into the water and by firing a harpoon-like poison-tipped tooth into its prey.No antidote exists for a cone snail sting, which contains a mixture of nerve agents. The new research has uncovered one highly unusual ingredient in the cone snail's venom cocktail - weaponised insulin. In tests, a synthetic version of the hormone - made from shorter protein chains than normal insulin - lowered the blood sugar levels of adult zebrafish. Injected into water, it also reduced the movements of fish larvae. There are about 30 recorded instances of people being killed by cone snails, some of which have attractive and collectible shells. Dr Jonathan Hendricks, a paleontologist at the San Jose State University who led the research, said that the lack of colouration in many fosisilised cone snail shells made them difficult to identify. He said: 'Original coloration patterns \u2014 if not the actual colors themselves \u2014sometimes become visible when fossil shells are illuminated with ultraviolet light, which causes formerly pigmented regions of the shell to fluoresce. 'Once a specimen has been photographed under UV light, it is possible to use photoediting software to reconstruct the original shell coloration pattern. 'This is done by creating a reversed, negative image, which causes bright, fluorescing markings to become darkened, corresponding with regions that were once pigmented.' Dr Hendricks used the ultraviolet technique to examine a range of fossilised shells that were discovered in the Cibao Valley of the northern Dominican Republic. Although it is now a rich and fertile inland valley, millions of years ago during the Neogene it was covered by ocean. All cone snails are venomous and predatory, with many species still around today. They use a harpoon like tooth that injects venom into their prey. In some cases the cone snail toxins are lethal to humans while many have a painful sting. Due to their bright colours and patterns they are often handled by unwary humans, leaving them vulnerable to stings. There are around 700 species of cone snail still living in tropical seas worldwide and around 1,000 species have been found in the fossil record. This image shows three of the fossil shells studied by the scientists as they currently appear without colour . Scientists used UV light to reveal tiny traces of the pigment left in the shell and the patterns they once had . However, identifying these can often be tricky as over time the bright pigments in the shells fade. Exposing them to ultraviolet light causes any remaining organic matter in the shells - like pigment - to fluoresce. It is thought that these compounds in the shells oxidise over time and so light up when UV light is shined on them. Dr Hendricks, whose work is published in the journal Public Library of Science One, compared the cone snail shells he examined with the patterns of those of modern Caribbean cone snails. He found that many of the fossils showed similar patterns, indicating that some modern species belong to lineages that have survived in the Caribbean for millions of years. UV light allowed scientists to peer back millions of years to reconstruct shell patterns and colours as above . Dr Hendricks said: 'This approach \u2014 combined with the exceptional Neogene fossil record of the Dominican Republic, as well as other regional fossil deposits \u2014 has the potential to provide a detailed understanding of the evolutionary and biogeographic development of the modern western Atlantic cone snail fauna. 'Clearly much more work needs to be done to better understand the compounds responsible for shell coloration. 'That said, it seems that oxidation - caused either naturally by exposure of shells to sunlight over prolonged periods of time, or artificially by soaking in bleach for several days - plays a role in causing formerly pigmented regions of fossil shells to fluoresce under UV light, though the reason is not currently understood.' C. geographus (above) is one of 700 existing cone snail species and is one of most venomous living animals .",

        "article": "(CNN)I usually think of April as tax month, but it seems to be morphing into National Get Tested Month.  Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban advised Twitterers to have their blood tested for everything available -- and to do so every three months. Following her mother's cancer diagnosis, singer Taylor Swift urged her fans to remind their parents to get screening tests.  And Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey signed legislation to allow Arizonans to get any lab test without a doctor's order. Freedom of information -- always sounds like a good thing. But there are many lab tests to order on yourself: Medicare's Clinical Diagnostic Laboratory Fee Schedule lists over a thousand.  They are not all blood tests, but a lot of them are.  And since blood tests require blood, you would surely develop at least one medical problem if you actually followed Mr. Cuban's advice to get them all: anemia. A frothy private sector is gearing up to serve the \"test me\" market.  In those states that allow it -- and over half do -- laboratories are offering walk-in and online services to individuals who want to check their own lab values.  (And if you want to get in on the ground floor of this business, check out the franchise opportunities at Any Labtest Now, Fastest Labs, and All Labtests Fast.) Some might argue that this freedom to test is the path to a healthier society. But the primary effect won't be more health, but rather more medical care.  Fundamentally well people will appear in doctors' offices with \"abnormal\" results.  Abnormalities are common in normal people, as we learned when Whole-body CT scanning was in vogue a decade ago (thankfully, only briefly).  So doctors will increasingly face one of two options: take the time to reassure these new patients that their results aren't really that abnormal or chase down abnormal results with more testing. Further testing will often make clear that the initial results were false alarms.  Or it will confirm the presence of abnormality -- most of which will be minor abnormalities.  Often it won't be clear what to do, but doctors will be pressed to do something.  That's when the real problems begin. Will anybody be helped? Maybe.  Will anybody be hurt?  Definitely.  The disturbing truth is that it is hard for us to make well people feel better.  But it's not that hard for us to make them feel worse. Decades of research have shown that there are real side-effects to testing the well: more anxiety (that can't be good for your health), more procedures (which often involve needles, pain and can even lead to complications like collapsed lungs) and more treatment for \"disease\" not destined to cause problems (as in over a million additional American men treated for prostate cancer, ditto women for breast cancer).  To see how far wrong testing can go, check out South Korea: where ultrasound screening has increased the amount of thyroid cancer -- and thyroid cancer surgery -- by 15-fold. I can tell you one thing for sure, the freedom to test won't save money.  Sure, a competitive market will drive down prices for individual tests.   But advertising will drive up the volume of testing.  And then there are all the office visits and subsequent testing for the abnormal results.  This will cost people real money -- either in terms of higher insurance premiums or higher out-of-pocket costs. Maybe this kind of freedom of information isn't such a good thing. Of course, there have been genuine advances in diagnostic testing.  Diagnostic tests can be extremely useful in sorting out acute medical problems.  But if you feel well, don't think that testing will make you feel better. The biotech sector is excited about testing well people -- it's a huge market -- and is developing lots of new product.  Now you can sequence your DNA, soon you will be able to monitor your immune system's signature.  Now you can monitor your vital signs on your smartwatch, soon you will be able to test your breath for lung cancer on a phone app.  They are even implanting thermodynamic sensors in a bra to test for breast cancer. A breast cancer monitoring bra -- I can't make this stuff up. Should we outlaw an individual's freedom to test?  No. We don't need another victimless crime.  But it is certainly an area that demands regulation.  The Food and Drug Administration has a longstanding mandate to protect us from snake oil treatments.  Now it needs to start worrying about snake oil testing. It's also an area that demands education.  The public needs to know that while medical data can be very useful, that doesn't mean they are routinely useful.  Abnormalities in sick patients mean something different than the same abnormalities in well people.  It is easier to collect data than it is to know what the data mean -- much less what to do about the results. Freedom is a good thing.  But feel free not to exercise your freedoms.  Just as carrying a gun doesn't necessarily make you any safer, testing yourself doesn't necessarily make you any healthier.",

Firing guns in the air is a traditional way of celebrating special occasions in some parts of Saudi Arabia and despite government efforts to stop it, the dangerous practice lingers on. Shotgun wedding: The groom's brother was caught on camera as he lost control of a Kalashnikov while firing a celebratory round into the air . Banging start: As the man starts shooting, he loses control of the rifle and fires at the wall by mistake, sending bullets spraying across the street over the wedding guest . The incident was caught on camera, and the short clip shows the wedding party making its way towards the wedding hall when suddenly the brother of the groom starts shooting in the air. As he fires off the celebratory round, he loses control of the Kalashnikov rifle and fires at the wall by mistake, sending bullets spraying across the street. Once he stops shooting, the video shows the guests attempt to reform a queue and act as if nothing untoward had happened, while  resuming their slow procession to the wedding. The 30-second clip, believed to have been filmed with a mobile phone has been viewed nearly 140,000 times. Several online commentators criticise the gunman, calling him irresponsible and unable to hold his rifle right.

'Even though I do not know much about firearms, I can tell you he was not holding his Kalashnikov correctly.' Another, Byzanti, said: 'The police should use the video clip to identify the brother and apply the law. 'As long as there is no punishment, people will continue to act irresponsibly. Those who attempt to show off their firearm skills are usually cowards in real action.' Abu Atab posted: 'The Kalashnikov man should be tied up alongside the family sheep until the wedding is over.' The Saudi government has been calling for an end to the local tradition of firing guns into the air to celebrate weddings and birthdays, which has often resulted in accidental deaths. A government spokesman said: 'Security agencies have been told to monitor wedding halls and places of celebration to prevent this sort of thing happening. 'Those that break the law will be severely punished. We are aware of this video and relevant authorities are looking into it.'",

Legal documents obtained by TMZ state that the marriage has 'broken down irretrievably.' It has been reported they separated three weeks ago. And because they have no children together there is no issue about child support but they are fighting over property already, it was alleged on Friday. He has already moved out of their New York City apartment. The couple has secured their own attorneys and are discussing the terms of divorce, according to the news site. Once so close: Flay and March, who reportedly separated three weeks ago,  pictured in January 2013 . TMZ went on to report that the marriage began to unravel over the past year and a half. Sources told TMZ that the union crumbled when Stephanie's appendix burst and Bobby didn't come to the hospital until the next day. Stephanie claimed, according to TMZ, that Bobby said 'he was busy with work' and instead sent his assistants to help her. Moved out: The Iron Chef Of America star - pictured in 2013 - is said to have moved out of the couple's New York City apartment . Boiling point: The marriage suffered when Stephanie's appendix burst and Bobby didn't come to the hospital until the next day because he was busy, TMZ reported; Flay was pictured with President Obama in 2009 . In February, the pair didn't celebrate their 10th wedding anniversary together. According to TMZ, Bobby attended a wine festival in Florida with his assistants instead. This will be Stephanie's first divorce and a third for Flay, whose two previous marriages both ended in divorce. In January, Flay was rumoured to be romantically involved with fellow chef Giada De Laurentiis after the 44-year-old Giada At Home star announced her split from her husband of 11 years, Todd Thompson. The Iron Chef Of America star and Giada were spotted having 'a festive dinner out together' at Cecconi's, in the private Soho Beach House, in Miami Beach on December 27, 2014, as People reported. In a statement to Gossip Cop, Giada said that any suggestion of a romance was false. Bobby has a daughter Sophie with second wife Kate Connelly, who he wed in 1995 and divorced in 1999. His first wife is Debra Ponzek, who he wed in 1991 and split from in 1993. 'Festive dinner out': Bobby and fellow chef Giada De Laurentiis (pictured 2012) enjoyed 'a festive dinner out' together in Miami Beach on December 27, sparking rumours of a romance, which Giada later denied .",

        "article": "Darren Humphries, 37, was jailed for eight weeks for throwing chocolate mini eggs at his estranged wife . An angry husband who assaulted his estranged wife by pelting her in the face with chocolate mini eggs has been jailed for eight weeks. Darren Humphries, 37, began throwing Cadbury Mini Eggs at wife Claire, 31, after drunkenly losing his temper on March 3. Magistrates heard he flipped when his partner of 14 years refused to allow him into her home to see their two children. Humphries forced the door open and grabbed his wife by the jaw causing her to fall back into the house. He then picked up a packet of the chocolate treats - which had been bought for Easter - and began throwing individual eggs at her head. JPs were told Mrs Humphries managed to call police and her husband was arrested at the property in Windermere Drive, Worcester. On Monday he was jailed for eight weeks at Worcester Magistrates Court after pleading guilty to assault by beating and using violence to secure entry to a premise. Humphries, of no fixed abode, launched a tirade of abuse and expletives directed at magistrates when the sentence was announced. Sentencing, chair of the bench, Sue Dowty, said: 'There were lots of aggravating factors. 'The location of the offence, the fact it was domestic violence, you were in drink and it was carried out in front of your children.' The court heard in a separate incident Humphries damaged his estranged wife's car by throwing wheelie bins at the vehicle on February 23. Prosecutor Mark Soper said the defendant had launched the bins after Mrs Humphries had refused to let him sleep inside her Volkswagen Golf. He told the court: 'The couple have been separated since February 2014 after 14 years together - they have two children, a 10-year-old boy and an 8-year-old girl. 'It seems Mr Humphries became mentally unwell and his wife decided the relationship should end. 'He had become very difficult to live with, using drugs and alcohol to self-medicate. Worcester Magistrates Court heard Humphries flipped when his partner of 14 years refused to allow him into her home to see their two children and began throwing Cadbury Mini Eggs after drunkenly losing his temper . 'This led to abusive and violent behaviour towards her and left her in fear of him. 'During the first incident he went to the home address. He was in drink and asked to be allowed to sleep in her car, but she did not allow him. 'He threw wheelie bins at the car and was arrested and charged with that offence. 'In the next incident he forced the door open and grabbed his wife by the jawbone causing her to fall into the house.' Mr Soper added: 'He was shouting at her and eventually released her, causing her further distress because she was in fear of him. 'Then he started throwing Cadbury Mini Eggs at her. 'She managed to call the police and the matters were admitted in interview.' Rob Macrory, defending, said: 'This behaviour is born totally out of frustration. 'He was driven by the emotion of wanting to see his children and he is generally so fed up in life. 'There are mental health difficulties but he does not believe he has a problem with alcohol. 'I would ask the court to consider that there were not extensive injuries to the victim and he only has a very short record.' Magistrates also imposed a restraining order preventing Humphries from contacting his estranged wife either 'directly or indirectly.' He was ordered to pay a victim surcharge of \u00a385.",

        "article": "A coroner has warned of the dangers of bedside cots after a seven-week-old baby choked to death. Grace Joy Roseman died after she managed to manoeuvre herself over the edge of her crib and a \u2018safety ridge\u2019 cut off the oxygen to her brain. West Sussex coroner Penelope Schofield yesterday issued a report expressing concern over the Bednest Bedside cot, which was endorsed by the charity National Children\u2019s Trust, saying urgent action must be taken to prevent future deaths. Tragic: Seven-week-old Grace Joy Roseman died after she managed to move over the edge of her adjustable cot and a 'safety' ridge cut off oxygen supply to her brain, West Sussex Coroner's Court heard . Concerns: The webpage of the luxury cot which has been linked with her death. A coroner has called for the 'dangerous' cot to be pulled from the shelves after the newborn baby girl was strangled . Grace\u2019s mother Esther put her down for a nap at around 8.30am on April 9. The cot \u2013 which is designed to be placed next to a parent\u2019s bed \u2013 has a moveable panel on one side which can be folded down, leaving a ridge just 7cm high. Mrs Roseman returned about 90 minutes later to find Grace unresponsive, lying with her head over the edge of the cot. The provisional cause of death was given as asphyxia, caused by the ridge cutting off the oxygen supply from Grace\u2019s windpipe. In her report, Mrs Schofield listed a number of concerns surrounding the cot. She said: \u2018In my opinion urgent action should be taken to prevent future deaths ... should another baby be placed in the prone position and left with the side incompletely lowered again in one of these cots, another death could occur. 'If the cot\u2019s side is not safe to be incompletely lowered or for the cot to be tilted more than 5cms then it should be questioned as to whether these should be options available at all.\u2019 Grace\u2019s father Gideon, who lives with his wife in Haywards Heath, West Sussex, said: \u2018There are no words that can describe how we feel about the loss of our beautiful little Gracie. Grace's parents told the inquest\u00a0'We are eternally grateful to the doctors and nurses at the Princess Royal Hospital in Haywards Heath (pictured), who did everything possible to try and save our little Gracie' \u2018She was just starting to develop her own little personality and was always smiling. We would not wish any parent to have to go through such a devastating loss.\u2019 The National Children\u2019s Trust has pulled the cot from sale and stopped all pending orders going out. Susie Parsons, interim chief executive of the charity, said: \u2018This is a tragedy and our thoughts and deepest sympathies are with the Roseman family at this time. \u2018We have immediately suspended all sales and despatches of the Bednest crib until the completion of the inquiry and we will also undertake our own detailed and thorough review.\u2019 Bednest, which is based in Stratford-upon-Avon, is still selling the cribs on their website from \u00a3249. The page boasts an endorsement from Jools Oliver, the wife of celebrity chef Jamie. Mrs Oliver writes: \u2018We love the Bednest ... I love the way it is so close to our bed the sides are really easy to pull down. \u2018Easy and definitely eliminates the fear of falling asleep with them in your bed and suffocating them as they lay safe next to you but in their own safe little cosy bed.\u2019 A spokesman for Bednest told MailOnline: \u2018We are greatly saddened and extend our heartfelt condolences to Grace\u2019s parents. \u2018We are doubly upset to hear this news, since the concept behind Bednest\u2019s design is first and foremost about baby health and safety and came originally from highly experienced neo-natal nurses. \u2018It is not the case that the coroner has called the cot \u201cdangerous\u201d and asked for it to be withdrawn. \u2018The coroner has highlighted that all safety guidelines for the correct use of the crib are laid out in the instruction manual, but due to a growing second-hand market for our Bednest cribs, these instruction manuals may not be passed on. This may be, sadly, what happened with Grace\u2019s crib. \u2018We are now considering displaying basic instructions on the side of the crib itself.\u2019",

        "article": "Victor Wanyama took to social media on Thursday in a bid to dismiss rumours he was set to quit Southampton for Arsenal. 'To cut the story short have never spoken to Wenger,' Kenyam midfielder Wanyama wrote on Twitter, prompting an outpouring of praise from Southampton fans, and less enthusiastic responses from Gunners supporters. The Saints enforcer later followed those comments with a series of tweets, saying: 'The newspaper article does not say that I have spoken to Wenger or anyone else from Arsenal - and that's the truth.' Victor Wanyama's stock has risen in the Premier League since arriving at Southampton from Celtic . Saints midfielder claims that he has never spoken to Arsene Wenger over a move to the Emirates . The Sun linked the 23-year-old with Arsenal, quoting Wanyama as saying Wenger had been discussing him and had 'let it be known' he was interested in signing the former Celtic powerhouse. He was linked with the Gunners before moving from Celtic to Southampton for \u00a312.5million in 2013 and his stock has risen in the Premier League after forging a midfield partnership with another reported Arsenal target \u00a0Morgan Schneiderlin. The Kenya international reportedly told\u00a0The Sun\u00a0that he is open to a move that would see him playing Champions League football next season after Wenger expressed interest in signing him. According to the paper, Wanyama said:\u00a0'Wenger has been talking about me, and he has let it be known he would like to sign me this summer, . 'Arsenal are a great club and I'd love to play Champions League football as I loved being on that stage with Celtic.

Southampton are expected to lose more players in the summer, including Morgan Schneiderlin . Wanyama has reportedly not ruled out a reunion with former Saints boss Mauricio Pochettino at Tottenham . The tough-tackling midfielder has also been linked with a reunion with former Saints boss Mauricio Pochettino at Tottenham and Wanyama has apparently not ruled out a move to the opposite end of north London. 'If I get the chance, maybe,' he reportedly told the Sun. 'You never know what will happen in the future. It's nice to be linked with other clubs as it means I'm playing well.'

        "article": "Louis van Gaal says the prospect of facing Aston Villa scared him more than the idea of taking on Manchester City at Old Trafford. United will be looking to end a run of four successive Manchester derby defeats on Sunday when City make the short trip across town. Van Gaal lost his first encounter with United's closest rivals last November, when Sergio Aguero struck the only goal in a 1-0 win for the Blues. Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal insists he is not worried about the prospect of his side facing Man City . Van Gaal, pictured with Juan Mata on Friday, believes Man City will not be as defensive-minded as Aston Villa . Manchester United are currently one point ahead of local rivals Manchester City . But Van Gaal is confident of victory this weekend, stating that he thinks City's attacking tendencies will work in United's favour. Van Gaal believes teams that come to Old Trafford looking to scrap for a point are much harder to beat. Van Gaal is so sure of that theory that he spent less time fretting about Sunday's opposition than he did last week when relegation-threatened Villa came to Old Trafford. 'I had more fear of Aston Villa than Manchester City,' the United manager said, before adding: 'Aston Villa was more defensive. 'I don't expect Manchester City shall play so defensive as Aston Villa. Then you need a lot of focus and concentration on our defence. 'A long ball is very difficult to defend. But (against) Manchester City, I don't expect very much long balls. 'It's another game and that's why I have less fear against Manchester City in spite of losing 1-0 against them in the last game.' Ander Herrera scored two goals as Manchester United picked up all three points against Aston Villa . Sergio Aguero scored the only goal of the match during this season's previous Manchester derby . That is not to say he would not cherish his first win over City. 'I dream of it, every player shall dream of the victory,' the United boss said. During his nine months in charge, assistant manager Ryan Giggs and club chef Mike Donnelly have taught the Dutchman about United's rivalries. But if he needed a reminder of the enmity between City and United, he got it this week from his wife Truus, whose hairdresser is a blue. 'I'm not so often in the city, but when I am there, the people are talking about the derby and even when I come home my wife is saying the things they have told her about this derby,' Van Gaal told MUTV. 'My wife's hairdresser is a Manchester City fan so there is a lot of discussion between these two women. 'I like it. You play football for the fans and I hope we can give our fans the victory.' Bragging rights are not the only thing at stake. Victory would strengthen United's grip on third place as they would then be four points clear of their 'noisy neighbours'. A third-placed finish would guarantee direct entry into the Champions League and that is what Van Gaal is aiming for. 'When you win, third place is then reachable and a month ago nobody was thinking about that, besides me, of course,' Van Gaal said. 'Third is good because you are certainly qualified for the Champions League and then we do better than the goal that was set in pre-season.' Chris Smalling was sent off during his side's defeat at the Etihad Stadium back in November . Smalling is heckled by Manchester City supporters as he makes his way off the field . The fact that United and City are effectively battling for third position shows how disappointing their seasons have been. But Van Gaal has warned he will be setting out to land the top prize next year, after making a few additions to his squad. 'I want to improve my selection for the next season. Then we can make a bigger step,' he said. 'Sir Alex Ferguson has done it before. Jose Mourinho is doing it now. 'Last season he didn't win anything. Now he is winning the title, now I try to do that also.' United's run of five straight league victories has moved them above City, who have won just two of their last seven games in all competitions. The fact that City have had the edge on their rivals recently does not seem to bother the Dutchman though. 'That's not my history,' he said. 'The last game we played against them and we had a red card in the 39th minute - that is my history.' Chris Smalling was the man who was dismissed at the Etihad Stadium. The defender earned his first booking for blocking Joe Hart as he went to kick the ball out of his hands, and he was cautioned for a second time for clumsily hacking down James Milner. Van Gaal will remind his players they must stay on the pitch this weekend. He said: 'In such games always you have to control your aggression and we did not do that then, so I hope we have learned from that moment. 'We have had five red cards this year. It's a record in my career as a manager and that's not good.'",

        "article": "A woman who weighs 400lbs has told how men are paying her around $1,500 (\u00a31,000) a month to let them watch her devour fast food and sugary treats on camera. New Yorker Sarah Reign, 26, describes herself as a 'feedee', who gorges on junk food in various states of undress to titillate paying male viewers. After working shifts as a security guard at a factory, Miss Reign disrobes down to her underwear and switches on her webcam. Happy to be a 'feedee': Sarah Reign, from New York, supplements her day job as a security guard by gorging on camera for men who like to watch her eat . Miss Reign, who weighs 26 stone, says she enjoyed eating so much, she decided to turn it into a job . She says fans love to watch her enjoying food; she might gorge on a whole chocolate cake or cover her stomach with butter, acts that can earn her around $1,500 (\u00a31,000) a month in addition to her regular pay. After realising that her weight could become a lucrative sideline for her, she set about gaining more and is now six stone heavier than before she started. She says: 'I really enjoy eating. No one at work knows my secret. It felt awkward eating on camera at first as fans love to watch you chewing every mouthful. 'But I eat so much anyway I thought it'd be fun to do it on cam. I just keep eating until I'm full.' Her new career has also led her to the world of 'squashing', where men pay her to sit on them when she meets them in person. She says of her first squashing experience:\u00a0'It was awkward but I got really into it.' Miss Reign says that she won't sit on anyone naked though, always keeping her underwear on. Sarah Reign says her fans love to watch her enjoying food . The men who watch Miss Reign's videos love to see the plus-size entertainer chowing down on junk food . 'I won't do nude squashing,' she vowed. 'I just wear a vest top and tiny shorts.' The security guard adds that she has always been large and that her weight has never been an issue for her. In fact, in 2008, aged 20 and weighing 20 stone, she celebrated her figure by posting glamour shots of herself online in skimpy clothing. How did this sideline come to pass? Miss Reign joined a site for bigger women who like to flaunt their shape, she soon had plenty of male attention. 'It's such an ego boost,' she admitted. 'So many of them wanted to see me eat on camera, I thought, 'Why not?' After a period of using web cams for feeders, she then set up her own video channel. 'It's sexy to be big,' she said. 'I really enjoy eating on camera so I started gaining weight on purpose. 'I've put on six stone since I started. 'Lots of men want to feed me so much I can't move anymore, but that's not my thing. I still want to be active and do my day job.' The security guard admits she's a 'clean freak' and puts underwear covered in food straight into the washing machine when the camera is turned off . Squashing: Miss Reign now offers a service for men who enjoy being smothered by a larger lady . Her lingerie drawer is overflowing with different outfits  but the most common request is for Miss Reign to dress up as a pig. 'I have a piggy nose and ears that I wear and eat really messily in, covering my face with chocolate. 'But when the camera's off, I'm a clean freak and put my bra and the towels I use to cover the floor straight in the washing machine. 'Sometimes I take the camera into the shower and film myself getting clean, that's really sexy.' Although she had plenty of requests for squashing sessions, she did not take the plunge until three years ago. 'I had so many men ask, but there was a guy who lived nearby who wanted to try it,' Miss Reign said. 'The first time, I watched some videos the night before to prepare but nothing phases me. 'When I got to the hotel it was weird at first and it's hard not to laugh. 'He lay down on the bed and I climbed on top of him. But I got into it really quickly. 'For the hour session, I was crushing him the whole time.' Cashing in: With a lowly paid job in New York as a security guard, Miss Reign can boost her income by $1,500 (\u00a31,000) a month . Miss Reign has had eight squashing clients and some of them will not admit they love big women. 'A lot of them are in the fat closet,' she joked. 'They say how thin their girlfriends are and they're obviously worried they'll be the butt of their friends' jokes if they admit they love fat girls. 'But there's also men who want women to do stuff like this but most girls won't believe them that they think fat is sexy. 'They're self-conscious and want to look slimmer, not embrace their shape.' One of her other sidelines is posting out her lacy pants after they've been worn. She has had long-term boyfriends since she started being a part-time squasher. 'It's not been an issue for them. Some of them have watched the videos, some of them haven't,' she said. 'Most of them have really supported me and didn't care. 'I'm single right now, but I wouldn't rule out going on a date with an online fan. 'I have men ask all the time, it's more that it's not practical and they're in other countries. I have lots of fans in the UK and Germany.' 'But if they were from the US, I would never say never.'",

As Ben Sunderman, 19, who has Down syndrome waited to find out whether he got a spot on the special education internship with Embassy Suites, the anticipation was overwhelming for the family. In the video filmed by his mother, he thoroughly looks over the letter on April 10 as she anxiously interrupts him wanting to know the decision - which he does not reveal until the end shouting 'I get it. I get the job!' With hugs, laughs and excitement all around, the priceless reaction left him and his family with big smiles. Scroll down for video . For Texas teen Ben Sunderman, it was a proud moment (above) last week when he ticked a goal of getting a job off his list of things to do before turning 21 that was captured on video . During the three-minute video posted onto Facebook by his dad Scott Sunderman, Ben reads the letter and his mom eagerly interrupts asking if he got it which he quiets her several times (left). Once he finishes reading it, he freezes with shock as he takes in the news (right) During the three-minute video posted onto Facebook by Ben's father, Scott Sunderman, the family is in their kitchen while his mother Sharon Sunderman is filming the moment. As Ben begins to read the letter, he is heard saying 'congratulations' to which is mom says 'Ben what does that mean?' He quiets her by putting up his hand and continues to read the letter but hilariously she cannot contain her excitement and keeps stopping him as he reads. Ben shouts 'I get it, I get the job!' as he rushes over to his dad and leaps into his arms as they embrace in a big hug . Ben's mom, Sharon (pictured above with her husband Scott) said they always encouraged their son to do everything he could do . Once he finishes reading the letter in its entirety, he puts it down and freezes with shock as he takes in the news. He then looks at his parents and shouts 'I got a job' as he rushes over to his dad and leaps into his arms as they embrace in a big hug. His mom is heard cheering loudly as they all celebrate over his acceptance letter for the internship. Ben puts up both of his fists as he finally has accomplished one of the things on his list before turning 21 - which also includes building his muscles and finding a girlfriend. But for the 19-year-old, this achievement comes behind a line of others. Last year, his mom said he won the title of prom king by a landslide, according to ABC. Last year, Ben's mom said he won prom king by a landslide at school (pictured above) Ben was one of 12 students with special needs who earned a spot on the internship which will begin in August . 'We just always encouraged him to do everything he could do,' she told ABC. 'He does his laundry like his siblings, makes his bed like his siblings.' His internship - which he applied for through Project Search, a program that helps children with disabilities progress from high school to the working world - will begin in August. Ben will travel from his home where he lives with his parents in McKinney to the hotel via public transportation, working eight hours for the internship. Only 11 other students with special needs received an acceptance letter for the placement that will teach them skills in administrative services and housekeeping at Embassy Suites, Nicole Buvari from the company told News 8. And following the news, the family continues to take in the excitement from their son's latest accomplishment. 'Everyone sees him as Ben and loves him for who he is, which is great,' Mrs Sunderman told ABC. 'Just the joy that Ben has at the fact that he is able to get a job and be part of the community. That's what every parent wants for their kid.'",

        "article": "It had seemed fake tan was here to stay after becoming a beauty staple for many women who wanted to emulate their favourite celebrities\u2019 bronzed looks. But their determination to achieve the perfect glow appears to be fading away in favour of adopting a lighter look. The number of bottles of fake tan sold in 2014 fell by nearly a quarter (24.1 per cent) from the year before, bringing the value of sales down by 19.3 per cent to \u00a314.5million. The number of bottles of fake tan sold in 2014 fell by nearly a quarter from last year. The product used to be a favourite of many celebrities including Victoria Beckham (left) and Sam Faiers (right) Georgia Percy, of retail analysts Kantar Worldpanel, which gathered the data, said it suggests women are \u2018tending towards a more natural look\u2019. She added that artificial tanning products were the hardest hit sub-sector of the sun care market. And Sandra Vaughan, a beauty consultant for artificial tan brand Fake Bake, said the pale look is now more fashionable. Fake tanning had become part of many women\u2019s regular beauty regime thanks to its popularity among celebrities such as former Spice Girl Victoria Beckham, the stars on Strictly Come Dancing and the cast \u2013 both male and female \u2013 of reality TV show The Only Way Is Essex. But even the TOWIE crew themselves admit the look can easily go wrong. Sam Faiers, who was a brand ambassador for Fake Bake, has described her horror at looking unnaturally orange on occasion. Pale skin icons include the likes of Keira Knightley, pictured (above) at the 87th annual Academy Awards, Cara Delevingne and Gwyneth Paltrow . She said: \u2018Just before Christmas I overdid it with the fake tan. I made my legs too dark and I just thought, what have I done?!\u2019 Other TOWIE performers have admitted similar errors, including Lauren Goodger, who was a particularly vivid colour when attending a Woman\u2019s Own event last year. Even the programme itself has ridiculed the dangers of fake tan. Charlie Sims became a laughing stock after emerging from a spay tan session designed to improve his appearance and self-esteem only to look like an orange extra from the famous Tango TV commercials. His sister, Chloe Sims, famously stripped off to be the face and body of Montana Tan\u2019s Starship Range. Georgia Percy, from Kantar Worldpanel, said sales of artificial tanning products were the hardest hit sub-sector of the suncare market in 2014. \u2018As with total suncare, the key contributor to decline was fewer shoppers, suggesting women are tending towards a more natural look,\u2019 she said. Lou Ellerton, of consultants the Value Engineers, told The Grocer magazine: \u2018Reality TV shows were effectively ongoing ads for fake tan but they passed their peak. 'It\u2019s like fake tan has been off the air for a while.\u2019 Pale skin icons include the likes of Keira Knightley, Cara Delevingne and Gwyneth Paltrow. The weather has also played a part, she said. \u2018If skin is not on show, why dress it up?\u2019",

        "article": "Amid a torrent of rumours surrounding Rafa Benitez and his managerial future, the Spaniard quietly continued a phenomenal career trend on Thursday with Napoli. He took the Serie A side into the Europa League semi-final with an emphatic 6-3 aggregate victory over Wolfsburg and the impending encounters against Dnipro will be Benitez's seventh major European semi-final in 12 seasons. Napoli are the fourth club he has taken to the latter stages of a European competition, following spells with Valencia, Liverpool and Chelsea. Rafa Benitez (right) celebrates taking Napoli into the Europa League semi-final with striker Gonzalo Higuain . Benitez (centre) has reached his seventh European semi-final in only 12 seasons with four teams . Benitez (right) guided Liverpool to Champions League glory in 2005, his first season at the club . Benitez got Liverpool back to the final of the competition in 2007, where they were beaten 2-1 by AC Milan . 2004: UEFA Cup winner (Valencia) 2005: Champions League winner (Liverpool) 2007: Champions League finalist (Liverpool) 2008: Champions League semi (Liverpool) 2010: Europa League semi (Liverpool) 2013: Europa League winner (Chelsea) 2015: Europa League semi (Napoli) Benitez tasted continental success for the first time with Valencia in 2004, lifting what was then the UEFA Cup after beating a Marseille side spearheaded by Didier Drogba 2-0 in the final. That achievement, alongside the two La Liga titles he won during his three-year spell at the Mestalla, caught the eye of Liverpool, who swooped to bring the Spaniard in as Gerard Houllier's replacement. His first Premier League season was one of adjustment but in Europe, Benitez flourished. He recorded his most stunning glory to date, masterminding what on paper was a woefully uninspiring Liverpool team to Champions League glory, overcoming a star-studded AC Milan side that boasted the likes of Cafu, Paolo Maldini, Kaka and Andriy Shevchenko in the final. Benitez maneuvered Liverpool back to the Champions League final in 2007, eliminating Barcelona on the way with a win at the Nou Camp, only for Milan to avenge their defeat two years prior with a 2-1 victory. The Spaniard  manipulated another assault on Europe's elite trophy the following year but Liverpool were knocked out in the semi-final by Chelsea. Off-field ownership turmoil derailed Benitez's team and Liverpool have not even threatened to emerge as a challenger for club football's most prestigious competition since. They were eliminated in the group stage of the tournament in 2010, where a third-placed finish resulted in demotion to the Europa League. But Benitez guided Liverpool to the semi-finals of Europe's secondary competition, where a Diego Forlan strike in extra-time at Anfield sent Atletico Madrid to the final, where they beat Roy Hodgson's Fulham. The Spaniard was sacked as Liverpool manager at the end of the 2010 season and Hodgson replaced Benitez, who ended up at Chelsea as interim manager in 2012 via a short spell at Inter Milan. Benitez won the Europa League with Chelsea, beating Benfica in the final, but his stay at Stamford Bridge was always going to be a short one. Benitez often barbed Chelsea supporters while at Anfield and with Jose Mourinho's time at Real Madrid grinding to a halt, it was clear who Benitez was keeping the Chelsea hotseat warm for. Now at Napoli, Benitez finds his future at the club in question due to meandering domestic form. Napoli are currently fourth in Serie A, five points away from the top three (which equals Champions League qualification in Italy) with seven games remaining until the end of the season, when the Spaniard's contract expires. Benitez was not a popular choice at Chelsea but he still delivered silverware with the Europa League . Benitez first won the trophy with Valencia in 2004 shortly before moving to Liverpool . Benitez is out of contract at Napoli at the end of the season and has been linked with Manchester City . Benitez has been linked with a return to England with Manchester City, as Manuel Pellegrini has overseen a feeble attempt at defending their Premier League title, while some Liverpool fans even pine for him to return to Anfield. If Benitez does leave Napoli at the end of the season, he will surely have an array of suitors. He has 12 major honours to his name. Few coaches across Europe posses a record as imposing as his.",

        "article": "If Manuel Pellegrini leaves the Barclays Premier League at the end of this season \u2014 and it is by no means certain \u2014 then he will leave behind barely a trace. Inside Manchester City, the Chilean has always provided a welcome contrast to the emotional stresses of life epitomised by his predecessor Roberto Mancini but \u2014 on the field and across the landscape of English football \u2014 Pellegrini has made the shallowest of footprints. Progress at the Etihad Stadium has in recent years been slight. Indeed, you could say there has been none, particularly in relation to money spent. At City, however, the fact is that the identity of the manager represents only a small part of the problem. Manuel Pellegrini could be out of a job in the summer, and if he is, he will have left little behind . Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany has fallen well short of the standards he set in recent seasons . Pellegrini leaves the stadium as Manchester City suffered their fifth defeat in seven matches . As reported in Sportsmail after City\u2019s defeat in Barcelona last month, there is no particular desire at the club to sack Pellegrini. More poor results, more points separating his team from champions-elect Chelsea may cause the ground to shift a little further but any decision regarding the manager will be motivated much more by what happens next rather than what happened over the past eight months. Certainly, this has been a lamentable defence of the title, as bad as when conceding it by 11 points in 2013. At the Etihad there is, however, a recognition that problems are not all down to the manager. There are some issues with Pellegrini. Some City players think he is too nice \u2014 a soft touch who does not inspire with words or his substitutions and who displays a fondness for a 4-4-2 formation that they feel leaves them vulnerable. Pellegrini has not alienated or even polarised his dressing room, however. The majority are happy to work and play for him. The more significant problem is that City\u2019s squad, constructed carefully and expensively, is too old, too foreign and has not been improved by recent transfers. James Milner is one of very few Englishmen in a first team squad that is too foreign and too old . Manchester City signed defender Eliaquim Mangala for \u00a332million last summer and he has been poor . Wilfried Bony was signed in January from Swansea for \u00a328m but has only scored once since arriving . City have had a very good team for quite a while now. Signing David Silva and Yaya Toure in 2010 and Sergio Aguero a year later lifted them to their current level but nothing since the first Premier League title has hinted at the further progress many presumed would be inevitable. Recruitment has, on the whole, been poor, thus allowing established players to coast, perhaps subconsciously, without the pressure of in-house competition. Football director Txiki Begiristain has been largely responsible for this and his contribution, at least that which we can see, has been disappointing given the reputation earned at Barcelona. At all clubs, teams and players must move forward to thrive but too many at City have stagnated. Vincent Kompany, for example, no longer seems capable of looking after his own performances, never mind that of his team. For a club captain, his popularity in the City dressing room is limited. Elsewhere, players such as Samir Nasri contributed when City were playing well but disappeared once things became harder. Since hacking at Neymar during the Barcelona defeat, an act that earned him the cheapest of yellow cards, the France international has played only 13 minutes of two games. It is understood that the two things are not unrelated. Nasri is just one who may fret a little about his future this summer. Txiki Begiristain (left) has failed to live up to his reputation, and Manchester City's recruitment has been poor . Stevan Jovetic, a \u00a322m signing from Fiorentina, could find himself shipped out as City try to deal with FFP . Samir Nasri gives a thumbs up despite City's defeat at Crystal Palace, and the Frenchman's poor form . Wary of Financial Fair Play restrictions, City cannot spend enormous sums on targets such as Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba without first selling. Others who are vulnerable include Stevan Jovetic, Bacary Sagna and even Toure. The Toure debate is not new but what should be kept in mind is that the Ivorian will not be going anywhere until someone matches a salary that exceeds \u00a31million a month. It could be that City\u2019s climb back to the very top will be slow. They will need to be shrewder in the market and hope investment in their academy pays off. Better decisions are required from top to bottom. As for Pellegrini, he would be daft to think he is not vulnerable and a late-season surge would help him. Odd as it sounds, however, the identity of the manager is currently not City\u2019s biggest issue.",

A British schoolboy has drowned in a swimming pool on the last day of a family holiday in Lanzarote. Football-mad Logan Kehoe, 13, was having a final dip in the pool at a holiday complex in Costa Teguise when he died in what Spanish police have described as an 'accidental drowning'. Emergency services dashed to the pool on Saturday afternoon but despite paramedics performing CPR on Logan, they were unable to save him. A spokesperson for the Guardia Civil said: 'Emergency services were called to the scene at 14.30 and tried in vain to revive him using CPR.

        "article": "A Queensland man has opened up about a very special friendship between him and his best mate - a crocodile called 'Gregory'. Mick Tabone, 74, who previously owned and ran Johnstone River Crocodile Farm and zoo in far-north Queensland first came across the 5.2 metre croc in 1989. For 20 years the farmer would sit on the enormous creature's back while he chatted to him, and never once felt as though he was in danger. Rangers had already been trying to capture Gregory, who had apparently been killing cattle in Eubenangee Swamp near Mirriwinni, 70 kilometres south of Cairns for years, when they asked for Mr Tabone's help. Mick Tabone and Gregory the crocodile shared a strong bond during their 20 year long friendship . 'He was on the run for a couple of years, he had been a naughty boy and was taking cows,' Mr Tabone told Daily Mail Australia. 'The cattle used to come down there and have a drink and Gregory used to grab them by the nose and drown them,' he said. Mr Tabone then spent the next six months setting up traps for the huge creature, in a last bid to save him after a warrant had been issued to kill the croc. 'They had a trap for a couple of years but he just didn't go in, and after a certain amount of time, you know, there's a limit to the amount of time you can spend on this,' he said. 'They (National Parks) issued a warrant to the farmer to shoot him.' The farmer who owned the property where Gregory was snatching cattle called in the help of Mr Tabone and, helped by some 'freak weather', they were finally able catch the reptile. A heavy rainfall meant the trap which had been set up had moved and turtles had gone in after the bait, which Gregory then followed. Gregory was captured my Mr Tabone in 1989 after he was found stealing a local farmer's cattle . 'Three weeks later, water was down to about ankle-deep and I looked hard in the murky water and I said there's this great big massive animal in there,' Mr Tabone revealed. 'I said I've done the most horrible thing of my life, I've killed this big animal.' However upon closer inspection it appeared Gregory was alive and well, and had been keeping himself alive by coming up for air every few hours. 'Because of his size he was able to push the trap up to get a breath of air and then go back down for three to four hours,' the croc farmer said. After a huge operation which involved 16 men carrying Gregory onto the back of a truck and taking him back to Mr Tabone's farm, the creature was finally settled into what would be his home for the next two decades. The farmer describes the reptile that was his best friend as a 'funny animal', and said Gregory and him shared a special bond. He was named after Greg Cullen, the farmer whose cattle he was stealing. 'That gives me a memory of where I caught him from,' Mr Tabone said. The 5.2 metre croc and his farmer would spend time together every day, and Mr Tabone said he was never frightened or felt he was in danger . 'Greg would brings friends over to have a look at the crocodile named after him.' The crocodile would come when Mr Tabone called him, rushing up out of the water to greet his mate. The farmer would then spend time perched on Gregory's back, chatting to him about what was happening on the farm. 'Every day I was there I always spent time with him, I always sat on him,' Mr Tabone said. These meetings would take place between ten and 20 times a day, often in front of the tourists who came to visit the farm but sometimes just between the two of them. 'Sometimes depending if I had time I would go and sit on him and just hang out and chat to him'. When asked whether what he was doing was dangerous, Mr Tabone disagreed saying he never felt unsafe with Gregory. 'No, if I felt danger I wouldn't be in there. 'I love animals but I love living too,' he joked. Since Mr Tabone had to give up the farm in 2008 after repeated knee problems left him with less mobility than he was used to, the farmer has been back to visit Gregory only once. Mr Tabone\u00a0previously owned and ran Johnstone River Crocodile Farm and zoo in far-north Queensland . 'I went down after 18 months and went down to Gregory's cage and he was in the water,' he revealed. 'I called him over to the gate and he came over to me and the look on his face was just like \"Mick why did you leave me here?\"' 'They wouldn't let me go inside and I can see their point because it's not mine any more, I understand,' Mr Tabone said. 'He was a really lovely animal, the only reason I sold out was that I got an infection on my knee.' But Mr Tabone doesn't think he can go back to see Gregory again, who he believes has been moved to another farm. 'I can't go there again,' he said. Mr Tabone instead prefers to remember Gregory as he knew him, happily sitting with his farmer and best friend sitting on his back, having a chat.",

        "article": "Some of the most common pregnancy cravings are chocolate, ice cream or even pickles. But one unlucky woman from New York had a craving for something rather\u00a0unusual\u00a0and potentially very\u00a0damaging - rocks. For Silvia, star of the series My Extraordinary Pregnancy, suffered from pica, an eating disorder that makes people crave non-food substances. In the Discovery TV show My Extraordinary Pregnancy Silvia revealed how she suffered from pica during her third pregnancy meaning she wanted to eat rocks . In the programme that followed Silvia throughout her pregnancy, she is seen picking up tiny rocks from out side of her house, saying: 'I feel really upset and guilty, I feel ashamed but I have to do it.' The New Yorker is then heard saying: 'Over here are the ones that are easy to break,' as she walks around the garden. Silvia says on the show which airs on TLC: 'If I could trade with someone that's craving pickles or sushi I would do it, I would love that, I would trade that any day. 'When I see certain kind of rocks my mouth waters. Literally. It's like when you see something you really really want to eat. 'I try not to look down at the rocks and I try not to go by construction sites Because my system goes haywire and I get so excited. I want to eat some, I want to eat some, you know.' Dr Robert K Silverman Silvia's obstetrician explains: 'Pica is just eating any substance that is not food. It can be as simple as something like ice or it could be as complicated as eating nails. Silvia picks up the rocks outside her house, she is seen picking the ones that are small and soft . Silvia finds the rocks outside in little piles and then hides them around her house . 'We've talked about the risk of taking in pebbles, there are all different kind of diseases that you can get, there are all different types of parasites. 'And the fact that they can fill up their stomach can cause an obstruction. Pica can be very dangerous.' Silvia says: 'Obviously I need to stop, I've tried just about everything they've told me to try, I've tried eating corn starch, I've tried eating different type of candies that got the same consistency, but nothing so far has helped.' Silvia is seen hiding her tiny rocks around the house, behind lamps and behind the curtains, or even in a tea cup in the kitchen. But she is worried about the effects her bizarre eating habits are having on her unborn child: 'I could go the whole day without eating which is not healthy because the baby is not gaining the weight that he is supposed to be gaining. 'I'm not gaining the weight that I'm supposed to be gaining, there's no nutrition going in my body.' 'I've had a lot of stomach pains from eating rocks which is kind of scary, I worry about mine and the baby's health.' Silvias obstetrician says that pica can be very dangerous when, like Silvia, you are eating rocks . A pregnant Silvia plays with her two little boys in her garden ahead of their new arrival . Silvia's partner Estevan tells cameras: 'It's frustrating because everything she consumes the baby consumes, so when she has pains it's all because of this stuff that she's eating. You can't digest rocks.' When he decides to throw some of her rocks away Silvia reveals that it makes her feel anxious and stressed. Silvia said: 'He worries because he doesn't want me to hurt the baby, when he does find out I'm eating something he just feels like he's not doing enough. Estevan says: 'It's like being in a relationship with someone who does drugs, the hiding spots, the little drugs stashes here and there, the sneaking around. 'It does get frustrating but arguing about it is not going to help the situation.' Silvia says that she tried everything to stop her cravings but nothing worked . Silvia's partner Estevan is worried about her and what her rock eating habit is doing to their unborn child . After having stomach pains, the programme follows Silvia as she goes to the hospital and she admits that with her baby almost due she's been trying to keep herself away. When it's time for Silvia to give birth surgeon Jodi Wallis says: 'Pica in pregnancy is a concern because of the mom not getting other nutrients which she may need to get. 'Things that we'll look for in Silvia's baby is making sure the baby is healthy nutritionally and making sure that the baby doesn't have iron deficiency because that would be the biggest risk. Thankfully when the tiny tot is born he's completely healthy, the couple are thrilled with their bouncing baby. Silvia says: 'I'm so excited that he's okay.'",

PSG are chasing an unprecedented quadruple, as Laurent Blanc's side also made it to the French Cup final and currently lead Ligue 1. But they will be without Ibrahimovic next week against Barcelona in the first leg of the Champions League quarterfinals and the Sweden striker will miss also miss four matches of the domestic season after receiving another ban for his criticism of a referee. Ibrahimovic has been in tremendous form recently, scoring a hat trick in the 4-1 win over Saint-Etienne in the French Cup semifinals midweek and has bagged 13 goals in his last seven appearances for club and country. Once again, he was the man of the match at the Stade de France. With David Luiz and Thiago Motta both out with injuries, Serge Aurier returned to the PSG defence while Adrien Rabiot was given a starting role in midfield. In a tight start to the game, PSG created the first chance in the fourth minute when Ibrahimovic collected a long pass in the box following a free kick from Ezequiel Lavezzi, but the Swede was flagged offside. The PSG players celebrate as they are crowned winners of the French League Cup . Sweden international Ibrahimovic opened the scoring from the penalty spot in the first half .

PSG had a penalty claim turn down soon after when Gael Danic touched the ball with his right arm inside the box. But referee Benoit Bastien did point to the spot in the 20th minute when Squillaci brought Lavezzi down, with the former Arsenal player receiving a straight red card for his foul. Second on PSG's all-time top scorers list behind Pedro Pauleta with 104 goals, Ibrahimovic made no mistake from the spot, sending keeper Alphonse Areola the wrong way with a shot in the top left corner. Squillaci's red card forced Bastia coach Ghislain Printant to change his strategy, with Mathieu Peybernes coming in for Danic. The move did not make a big difference as PSG took complete control of the match and overwhelmed Bastia midfield. Ibrahimovic doubled the French champions' lead before half-time to put them firmly in control . The 33-year-old celebrates with team-mate Marquinhos as PSG cruised to victory . Pegged back in their own half, the Corsicans fought back PSG's relentless attacks for 20 minutes but a poor headed clearance from Peybernes fell into Ibrahimovic's path, with the 33-year-old chesting the ball down before unleashing a low shot at the near post to double the lead. PSG continued to apply pressure after the interval and went close in the 48th when Pastore saw his angled shot end just wide at the far post. PSG goalkeeper Nicolas Douchez enjoyed a quiet evening and Florian Marange failed to convert Bastia's first chance in the 56th minute, sending his header just wide.

Another PSG counterattack brought another goal in added time, with Cavani curling a shot past Areola from Ibrahimovic's assist as PSG claimed its fifth League Cup.

        "article": "(CNN)One war was enough for Gregory Margolin. Now 87 years old, he was a 16-year-old Jewish recruit when he fought in the Soviet Red Army. As he fought the Nazis in World War II, his family fled. \"I did not show that I was Jewish,\" Margolin says. \"But it did not matter because people were being killed left and right. All around me.\" This year, in Ukraine, he found himself again surrounded by war. Margolin was a sniper who rose to be a commander in the army. His old uniform is still adorned with medals from his time in the military. His granddaughter Liora still marvels at his stories from the war. She is amazed that he managed to survive. Suffering from Alzheimer's disease, a degenerative condition that impairs memory, he struggles to remember his own life sometimes, but he remembers the horrors of war. His eyes slowly shift back and forth as he seeks the right word. Or perhaps the right memory. His hands shake ever so slightly. It seems he knows he has lived a life. He is just trying to remember all the details. \"People were hiding in shelters under the ground,\" Liora says of the stories Margolin once told. \"They were being shot at point blank range. It was terrible.\" \"[The Nazis] would have erased us from the Earth,\" Margolin remembers. \"They attacked us and we fought back.\" After the war, Margolin settled in Donetsk in Eastern Ukraine. His family grew. He built a life. Then, decades later, he found himself in the middle of a war once again. \"A missile fell and the house was destroyed. We were attacked,\" Margolin says. \"A missile fell. I remember.\" Margolin's family lived in a neighborhood next to the Donetsk airport, near some of the most intense fighting in Eastern Ukraine as pro-Russian separatists battled the Ukrainian army. Margolin, who had survived one war, was able to survive another, even as the stray missile hit his house on February 10. It spared him, but it killed his daughter Ira. \"The moment it happened, we decided that's it. Here and now, we're moving to Israel,\" says Liora. \"This is the safest place.\" Margolin arrived in Israel on March 24. Asked why the family waited to leave the war-torn region of Eastern Ukraine, Liora says they felt they would be fine in Donetsk, while Liora prayed for their safety from Israel. \"No matter how much we're afraid of the next war here and as much as it's not quiet here, it is the quietest place.\" Margolin came over in a wave of Ukrainian Jewish immigration to Israel that coincided with the beginning of hostilities in Eastern Ukraine. The International Fellowship of Christians and Jews, an organization that works to build interfaith understanding and support for Israel, has brought 600 Jews to Israel since December, Margolin among them. Rabbi Yechiel Eckstein, the fellowship's founder, says, \"We set up a refugee center. It's the first time since the Holocaust that the Jewish world has had to set up a refugee center for these Jews who are fleeing and have nowhere to go.\" Among the Ukrainian Jews moving to Israel, Eckstein says they have worked with approximately a dozen Holocaust survivors. On Yom HaShoah, Israel's Holocaust Remembrance Day that commemorates the Nazi extermination of 6 million Jews, these stories of survival reverberate with a renewed energy. Jews who struggled to survive once find themselves fleeing to survive now. \"Most of the [Jewish] people in the Ukraine are Holocaust survivors or children of Holocaust survivors. These are the people who made it, who are able to flee or come back or to stay or to somehow survive the Holocaust.\" Margolin was one of these people, able to survive the Holocaust as a soldier in the Soviet Army. His story can be difficult for him to remember sometimes, but it is impossible for his family to forget. The voices of Auschwitz .",

Treasurer Joe Hockey said the states had agreed to work toward applying the 10 per cent GST to movies and music downloaded from streaming services such as Netflix and Apple. The changes may also affect consumers buying any products for less than $1,000 online from overseas, thus affecting companies such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon and eBay. But consumer advocacy group Choice says tech-savvy Australian consumers might be able to avoid the tax by concealing their location through virtual private networks, which make them appear to be outside the country. Scroll down for video . Australian movie and music downloaders could soon be slapped with a 10 per cent tax in a move that could reel in billions of additional GST revenue for the federal government . Choice argues that the government should instead be tackling the exorbitant domestic costs of TV shows, music and movies, and difficulties accessing them. Netflix subscription: 90c increase to $9.90 . Standard iTunes song: 22c increase to $2.41 . Google Play movie: 60c increase to $6.60 . Standard Amazon song: 13c increase to $1.42 . Adobe Creative Cloud subscription: 99c increase to $10.99 . 'We need to make it easier ... in order to encourage greater competition,' Choice chief executive Alan Kirkland told ABC radio on Friday. Netflix has indicated that it would increase the cost of its service in line with any new laws and regulations. 'We pay taxes as required under local and national law,' a spokesperson from Netflix US head office said. With an $8.99 per month fee for its service, Netflix customers would only have to pay at least an extra 90c while song downloaders would pay an additional 22c for $2.19 track on iTunes. Federal Treasurer Joe Hockey announced that each states and territories' treasurer had agreed to the tax, which he declared was an 'integrity measures for the tax base, not the broadening of the GST or an increase of the GST' With an $8.99 per month fee for its service, Netflix customers would only have to pay an extra approximate 90c while song downloaders would pay an additional 22c for $2.19 track on iTunes . Federal Treasurer Joe Hockey announced that each states and territories' treasurer had agreed to the tax, which he declared was an 'integrity measures for the tax base, not the broadening of the GST or an increase of the GST'. 'The states agreed in principle that we should move in that regard. I have offered to work as quickly as possible with them to introduce legislation to address that in relation to intangibles,' Mr Hockey said, according to the Financial Review. It comes after News Corp Australia chief executive Julian Clarke slammed the foreign companies' ability to avoid paying tax, consequently leading to an unlevelled playing field in the advertising market.

        "article": "Iran has forbidden its citizens from travelling to Saudia Arabia's holy sites over claims two teenaged boys were abused by Saudi airport officials while returning from a pilgrimage. Iranian officials made the decision following claims two of its citizens were abused while returning from an off-season pilgrimage at Jeddah airport in March. The announcement comes amid escalating tensions between the two regional powers, particularly over Saudi-led airstrikes in Yemen. Iranian protesters demonstrate against Saudi-led strikes in Yemen outside the Saudi Arabian Embassy in Tehran . Muslims undertaking the umrah in Mecca - the pilgrimage which is not obligatory in Islam can be taken at any time during the year . Sunni Saudi Arabia has led the bombing campaign against Yemeni Shiite rebels, the Houthis, much to the anger of Iran. Iran, a Shiite nation, is backing the rebel group. Iran's Foreign Ministry has said the two boys, aged 14 and 15, were abused by airport security after they were separated from other passengers for body searches, Russia Today reported. Iraninan Culture Ministry spokesman Hossein Nooshabadi told the state TV that the pilgrimage would be suspended until the Saudi government 'applies a strong attitude' to the case. He also said 'capital punishment' should apply to the case, without offering further details. The alleged abuse, the details of which have not been publicly disclosed, sparked unauthorized protests at the Saudi Embassy in Tehran on Saturday. Public anger has grown over the incident, with President Hassan Rouhani ordering an investigation and Iran's Foreign Ministry summoning a Saudi diplomat for an explanation. However there has been confusion over what exactly happened. Yesterday, a representative of Iran's top leader on pilgrimages to Saudi Arabia downplayed the case, saying the pilgrims weren't abused. 'In the incident, no abuse has happened and the two policemen who attempted abuse were identified and detained by Saudi police,' Ali Ghaziasgar was quoted as saying. Iranians burn Israeli and US flags: The shiite nation opposes Saudi Arabia's alliance with the United States . The alleged abuse to the two teenagers comes amid increasing tensions between the two regional powers . Some 500,000 Iranians visit Saudi Arabia each year for the off-season umrah pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina, Islam's holiest sites. The umrah differs from the annual Muslim hajj pilgrimage as it can be undertaken at any time of the year. Saudi officials haven't commented publicly on the dispute. Earlier this month, aviation authorities in the kingdom turned away an Iranian plane carrying pilgrims, saying it did not have permission to use the country's airspace, Saudi state media reported. On Monday hundreds of students staged a demonstration against the Saudi government outside its embassy in Tehran . On Monday, hundreds of students staged another demonstration in front of the Saudi embassy in Tehran, protesting the air strike campaign in Yemen. Relations between Shiite Iran and Sunni Saudi Arabia are hostile at the best of times. Iran has insisted in the past that its pilgrims be allowed to hold 'disavowal of infidels' ceremonies \u2014 rallies denouncing Israel and Saudi ally the United States - when on pilgrimages. Saudi Arabia bans such demonstrations at hajj and in 1987, one such rally led to clashes with Saudi security forces in which more than 400 pilgrims, mostly Iranians, were killed. Iran prevented pilgrims from attending hajj for three years after the killings. Relations between the two countries, Shiite Iran and Sunni Saudi Arabia, are hostile at the best of times .",

Former Destrehan High School teacher Shelley Dufresne was arrested in September after the teen in question started bragging to friends at the St Charles Parish, Louisiana school that he had slept with two teachers. An investigation later revealed that the unidentified teen had sex with both his current English teacher at the time, Dufresne, and his English teacher from the prior year, 24-year-old Rachel Respess - including an alleged a threesome with both at Respess's house. Scroll down for video . 'Free' woman: Shelley Dufresne, 32, confessed in court Thursday to having sex with a 16-year-old English student in exchange for a plea deal that gets her out of prison time. The married mother-of-three pictured above leaving the St Charles Parish Courthouse on Thursday . Double the trouble: Dufresne (right) and fellow teacher Rachel Respess, 24 (left), were arrested in September when a student at Destrehan High School started bragging that he was sleeping with both of them . How they met: The unidentified 16-year-old victim was a student in Dufresne's English class last year. Respess taught the same student English the year prior . Though she originally pleaded not guilty in November, married mother-of-three Dufresne changed course and confessed to the sordid act at a status conference in court on Thursday. In exchange for pleading guilty to a count of obscenity, the original charge of carnal knowledge of a juvenile will be held for the three years Dufresne is under probation for obscenity. Comfortable: As part of her plea deal, Dufresne will not have to serve any jail time. Instead she will undergo a 90-day inpatient mental health treatment program, surrender her teacher's license and stay away from the victim and his family . Dufresne must also undergo a 90-day inpatient mental health treatment, surrender her teacher's license, and stay away from the now 17-year-old victim and his family. If she complies with all of those terms, the carnal knowledge charge will be dropped after three years and she will not have to register as a sex offender. The carnal knowledge charge carries a maximum of ten years in prison and a fine for $5,000. Judge Anne Simon signed off on the plea deal, after three other judges - including Dufresne's father Judge Emile St Pierre - removed themselves from the case. District Attorney Joel Chaisson II heralded the deal as a success. 'I want to thank my special prosecutor, Julie Cullen, for her efforts to reach a fair resolution of the case and to secure a felony guilty plea, thereby sparing the juvenile victim in this matter from having to testify at a public trial,' the DA said in a statement. The parents of the victim were in court on Thursday, and according to media who attended the meeting, they were not happy with the settlement. However, Dufresne's legal battle is likely not over yet. When her relationship with the teen was exposed last fall, it was revealed that she had sex with the teen at a residence in Montz (Dufresne and her family live in Montz) and one in Kenner between August 22 and September 27. Dufresne still faces the possibility of jail time for allegedly having a threesome with the same student and Respess at Respess' residence in another Louisiana parish (pictured above). Neither woman has been formally arraigned on those charges yet . Above, Dufresne's home in Montz, Louisiana. The charges she settled Thursday had to do with sex acts she and the 16-year-old committed at a residence in that town . Both towns fall under different parishes, and Jefferson Parish has yet to formally arraign Dufresne on charges of carnal knowledge with a juvenile, indecent behavior with a juvenile and contributing to the delinquency of a child. It was at Respess' home in Kenner that the teachers allegedly had a three-way with the student after a high school football game in September, and that is the incident they await arraignment on. Since her arrest on September 30, Dufresne has remained free on bond. While she has been under house arrest during this time, the rules of the sequester have been loosened so that she can attend therapy sessions, Jazzercize classes and help drive her 3, 5, and 7-year-old children to school and extracurricular activities. However, she had to spend 8pm to 7am inside her home during the weekdays. Both Dufresne and Respess were suspended from their jobs without pay following their arrests last fall.",

        "article": "(CNN)As the Great Kate Wait of 2015 drags on, giving a whole new meaning to Kate's somewhat unfair noughties nickname, \"Waity Katie,\" bets on the arrival of a new baby a girl continue to be placed at a feverish rate. As of today, 70% of those laying down their hard earned cash are convinced the world is on the verge of welcoming a new princess. I suspect different parties are hoping for a girl for different reasons. Based on the so called \"Kate Effect\" and subsequent \"George Effect,\" the great British High Street is no doubt salivating at the prospect of record sales should HRH Princess (fill in the blank) of Cambridge be spotted in one of their outfits. As one headline blared this week, \"Baby girl could be worth $1.5 billion to the country.\" Magazine and newspaper editors are well aware of the dramatic rise in sales when a royal baby hits the cover, especially a little girl. And then there's Disney, which will always appreciate princesses in the zeitgeist, but as with all things relating to the monarchy, there is also a far greater historical significance should a baby girl arrive. There have been 34 Kings and only six Queens over the course of the British Monarchy's thousand-year history, and yet some of the nation's most enlightened times have occurred when a Queen has been on the throne. Elizabeth I led the country through the Golden Age, and Victoria and Elizabeth II -- the two longest reigning monarchs -- both made their mark with perhaps the most illustrious and progressive legacies of all. While it is unlikely this child will ever be crowned, as the daughter of the second-in-line to the throne, her role will be significant. Prince Charles has made no secret of his desire to slim down the monarchy, but in looking at his family's immediate bloodline -- William, Harry and George -- it stands to be a heavily male-dominated one. In an institution viewed by some as archaic and out of touch, it is imperative to have a strong female presence. Princess Anne -- Baby Cambridge's great-aunt -- grew up with three brothers, and was once described as, \"the greatest King the country never had.\" She is patron of more than 200 charitable organizations and carries out some 500 public engagements a year. A noted equestrian, she won two silver medals and a gold at the European Eventing Championships, and was the first member of the royal family to compete at the Olympics. More importantly she has supported her mother throughout her reign, flown the flag for Britain and promoted brand Windsor around the world. As the only girl born to Elizabeth and Philip, she has matched and often surpassed the accomplishments of her brothers. Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, also true blood princesses, are not \"working members\" of the royal family and generally only roll out for state and ceremonial occasions. So, yes, it would be nice for the baby to be a girl so that we can all ooh and ah over frilly dresses, fairy wings and ballet shoes (although as a Windsor she's more likely to be mucking out stables and shooting pheasant), but in truth the birth of a girl matters on a far deeper level: the monarchy needs a baby girl to fill the female void of future generations. The 20th century was ushered in by Queen Victoria and the 21st by Queen Elizabeth II. Should George live to eighty-seven he will be the first monarch of the 22nd century, but as I have said before the British monarchy is anything but predictable. If punters are right and William and Kate do announce the birth of a baby girl as the rightful \"spare,\" it's certainly possible that a seventh Queen may ring in the year 2100. In the event the couple welcomes a boy, however, I sincerely hope there won't be a collective groan of disappointment heard around the world -- after all on the few occasions we have seen Prince George he has been a veritable treat. The birth of any baby is cause for celebration regardless of gender, race, religion or indeed status, and as Prince Harry, the world's most eligible bachelor has shown, games of naked billiards can sell magazines too.

Simply referred to as 'the next Gear', images of the watch's circular face were unveiled as part of an announcement about Samsung's upcoming developer scheme. Samsung's previous watches have all had rectangular faces, or in the case of the  Gear S, a curved design. Simply referred to as 'the next Gear', images of the watch's circular face (pictured) were unveiled as part of an announcement about Samsung's upcoming developer scheme.\u00a0In its press release, Samsung said: 'The new wearable device will be the 7th generation of Samsung Gear with a wrist watch type' Motorola, Huawei and LG currently offer round watches, while the Pebble Steel and Apple Watch are square. In its press release, Samsung said: 'Members of global developer community can get early access to the Software Development Kit (SDK) of the company's next generation of the Gear device. 'The new wearable device will be the 7th generation of Samsung Gear with a wrist watch type.' It added that this is the first time Samsung has released its wearable SDK to  developers before the official product announcement, but didn't reveal release dates for either the software or the new device. Samsung's previous watches have all had rectangular faces, including the Gear Live (pictured left), or in the case of the Gear S (pictured right), a curved design . Motorola (Moto 360 pictured), Huawei and LG currently offer round watches, while the Pebble Steel and Apple Watch are square.\u00a0Paul Lamkin, editor-in-chief of Wareable told MailOnline: 'It's hardly surprising Samsung has announced plans for a circular smartwatch, the Orbis device has been on the web rumour mill for a while' Asus claims the \u00a3119.99 VivoWatch (shown) has a 10-day battery life. It goes on sale in May . Earlier this week Asus announced its VivoWatch, the first Asus wearable designed for fitness tracking. It has built-in heart-rate monitoring, sleep tracking, and a Happiness Index that shows a person's overall mood. It uses a numeric score, based on the wearer's activity level and sleep quality to shown a summary of how healthy the wearer's lifestyle is. A low score suggest the wearer should adjust their exercise and sleep habits, while a normal or high score provides motivation to maintain their healthy lifestyle. Asus claims the \u00a3119.99 VivoWatch has a 10-day battery life, and the watch case is IP67 water-resistant. It goes on sale in May. It did not reveal price details or any other specifications either. Elsewhere in the release Samsung said it has already worked with CNN, Yelp, Baidu, FidMe and Apposter in developing apps for the next gadget. Paul Lamkin, editor-in-chief of Wareable told MailOnline: 'It's hardly surprising Samsung has announced plans for a circular smartwatch, the Orbis device has been spinning on the web rumour mill for a while now but the timing, on Apple Watch launch day, is a little puzzling. 'Samsung's betting big on its own proprietary software and it makes sense to get developers in early to pack out the Tizen app store with circle-friendly apps. 'After all, with 3,000 Apple Watch apps reportedly already on offer, the Korean company is playing catch-up to its long-time rival, despite the fact it\u2019s been in the game a lot longer.' Apple's smartwatch officially went on sale today, but anyone turning up to buy one in the high street will be disappointed as none of its stores have them in stock. Instead, consumers have to pre-order the watches online or go to select partner shops and boutiques to buy the Watch today. Usually, Apple launches generate long queues outside stores. But analysts believe the company feared the queues might be 'embarrassingly small' and so opted to launch the watch with more of a whisper than a bang. In fact, despite the high price and some skepticism that consumers are keen to adopt a new generation of wearable technology, pre-orders have far exceeded expectations. As a result, the company's initial production run is simply not large enough to ensure that watches will be available in stores from today. Analysts believe Apple is sitting on some two million pre-orders and that sales could top 20 million this year.

Stephen Ebbett, global director of gadget insurer Protect Your Bubble, told MailOnline: 'It was rather sad not to see all those technophiles camping outside Apple Stores this week. 'I doubt this new sales strategy will do much harm to sales of the Watch, as Apple has incredible brand loyalty, but neither should it underestimate the impact those queues had. They are the most photographed and talked about queues in the world and I can think of no other brand gets that kind of exposure for a product launch.

This image shows the new button, 'Quote Tweet,' which triggers the action . Twitter began testing its tool last summer. Until now, Twitter users have had to embed tweets by cutting and pasting a URL and then adding a comment, within the 140 character limit.

They are so big, in fact, that students this year will likely spend of a third of their prom budgets on the elaborate new ritual, according to a new survey. With budgets for outfits, flowers, transportation, food and other sundries at around $1,000 for the average American high schooler, that means most intend to spend $324 on the once-simple query: Will you go to prom with me? Pricey promposals: Students this year will likely spend of a third of their prom budgets on the elaborate new ritual of promposals, according to a survey of 3,000 people conducted by Visa . That's according to a survey from Visa, which asked 3,000 people aged 18 or older what they expected to shell out for the prom and on what. For a primer on promposals, see previous years' winners of most outrageous (and viral) prom proposals. In 2012, Matthew Ho from Toronto promposed to his girlfriend, Tina, with 1,500 pink helium balloons and a sign that read, 'Tina, will you go to prom with me?' His stunt attracted a crowd in the hallway, giving the blindfolded Tina an audience when the stunt was finally revealed. It's unclear what the cost of these hockey pucks was, but the average American high schooler could spend over $300 just asking his or her date to the yearly dance .

His stunt attracted a crowd in the hallway, giving the blindfolded Tina an audience when the stunt was finally revealed . Some students have even rented plane banners to pop the prom question - at a starting cost of $1,000 in the New York area. 'It started last year \u2014 I've been in the business six years, and we had never sold a prom banner before then,' explained Remy Colin of Aerial Messages in Daytona Beach, Florida. At John B. Alexander High School in Laredo, Texas, senior student Isaac Garza asked his best friend, Kristelle, to prom in dramatic pre-planned chase scene with the school . Dressed in a tuxedo, and running into a packed assembly hall where Kristelle was waiting, unaware of what was going on, Mr Garza performed a rendition of Heath Ledger's famous scene in Ten Things I Hate About You, singing Lauren Hill's Can't Take My Eyes Off of You. Arresting: Palmdale, California student Davyeon was 'arrested' in his lunchroom thanks to prom date Stephanie. No word on how much she bribed the officer who cuffed him . Not always pricey:\u00a0Mike Ramirez, student at Crosby High School in suburban Houston, managed to get Texans cheerleader\u00a0Caitlyn to go to the prom with him by getting 10,000 retweets . Jamie Vandenberg from Ontario, Canada, promposed to his girlfriend Madison Dillion using a fake pop quiz that his teacher distributed at the beginning of class. As students reached question three, where Mr Vanenberg laid out statistical quandaries to Miss Dillon's yes or no answer, they realized their probability questionnaire was a ruse. When student Taylor Huestis opened her locker, 456 ping pong balls, all with 'prom' written on them, fell onto the floor. Huestis' boyfriend had planned the stunt for days, enlisting the help of her friends; his sign read 'I finally had the balls to ask you to prom!' Visa's prom survey also revealed some interesting regional and economic disparities. This year, Canadians plan to spend $508 overall on prom of which $151 will be on promposal, compared to $919 overall for U.S. families. Dads plan to outspend moms by 63%, $1160vs. $710.

        "article": "Northampton ruled George North out of their game against Clermont Auvergne on Saturday and sent him to see a neurosurgeon. The Wales and Lions wing has been removed from the firing line by his club ahead of the biggest game of their season to date following his third alarming head injury in the space of two months. The 22-year-old was knocked unconscious when struck by Wasps No 8 Nathan Hughes's knee as he was scoring a try at Franklin's Gardens last Friday night. Northampton have ruled out winger George North for the game against Clermont Auvergne on Saturday . North lies motionless on the Franklin's Gardens turf after being knocked out against Wasps . Having opted to act in the best interests of their marquee player \u2014 despite the importance of a Champions Cup quarter-final in France \u2014 the Saints have taken an encouraging step in response to fears about North's long-term health. Instead of merely abiding by the minimum, six-day return-to-play protocols, the Aviva Premiership champions have erred on the side of caution. 'In theory we could consider him,' said Jim Mallinder, Northampton's director of rugby. 'If it was his first one (head knock), then we would be considering him if he passed all the protocols and was available. Seeing as it's not his first, then it's the sensible thing to take specialist opinion. 'We won't play him at the weekend. Clearly he had a nasty knock. It was unfortunate. He did get knocked unconscious for a very short period of time. We'll listen to what the neurologist says. He's the expert. As always we'll listen to his advice.' In Tuesday's Sportsmail, former Scotland full back Rory Lamont \u2014 who has suffered the after-effects of concussion injuries \u2014 called for the Welsh icon (left) to be rested for six months, saying: 'It's a complete disgrace that it has got to this stage. George has been let down.' He was not the only voice raising the alarm, but the Saints are aggrieved that distant observers are weighing in with comments without being completely aware of the specifics. Mallinder called for a calm, measured assessment of the situation. 'There's been lots of opinion over the last few days in particular,' he said. 'We've got to be careful that we don't blow anything out of proportion. 'It's a tough game. George has said that himself. We're always going to have incidents, but player welfare will always come first.There's a balance to it. We've got to make sure we don't get hysterical about it, but we are sensible. Clearly there are players who, if they've had a knock, need time off to make sure that their bodies recover. A head injury is no different to any other type of injury. 'You can't just stop people playing rugby. People who play the game understand that there are inherent dangers. 'Players are now very well looked after and I think it's probably not at the senior level where you need to worry. It's probably a little bit lower down, maybe schoolboys and junior rugby, where players don't get as well looked after as ours.' Nathan Hughes arrives late as North touches down - moments later his leg connected with the wing's head . The Welshman receives medical treatment on the pitch before being taken off on a stretcher . In reference to last Friday night's incident, Mallinder stressed that North had considerable medical support, in contrast to how it used to be in rugby \u2014 when attitudes were very different. 'It's something now in the game which has improved,' he added. 'It's brilliant. Straight after the incident the players recognised it (the severity of the injury). 'We've got two doctors available, physios available \u2014 and they know exactly what to do. 'It's not right, but I remember playing 30 years ago and your touch judge was the man who looked after you and basically you got a sponge on your head and you were back out if you could walk. 'Clearly the game is much improved for what we've got now. I'm not concerned for him (North). We've got to look after him.' On Tuesday night, Hughes was banned until April 28 for his 'reckless' actions \u2014 colliding with North when the try scorer was on the ground, unable to protect his head. The sanction has divided opinion, with Wasps players incensed by what they regard as an unduly heavy-handed punishment for an offence which the disciplinary panel accepted was not malicious. Asked if he had any sympathy with Hughes, Mallinder initially refused to comment, but added: 'I said at the time I think it was a red-card offence. I still do. 'Therefore the disciplinary process has taken place and that's what he's got. Meanwhile, Wasps will make a statement over whether they will appeal Hughes' ban. After receiving the full written judgement explaining the decision, the club stated: 'We'll consider our options and make a decision.' North is congratulated by team-mates after scoring the first of his two tries against Wasps last Friday night .",

        "article": "Sheriffs are hunting a gunman who shot a young woman through the neck as she was driving down a Colorado interstate, amid fears he may have tried to attack other drivers too. The unnamed 20-year-old woman was driving on the I-25 in Weld County, north of Denver, when her window shattered and she felt bleeding from both sides of her neck. In a chilling 911 call from around 11pm Wednesday night, she told operators: 'I'm on the highway right now and somebody just hit me and I'm bleeding from my neck and I'm scared. 'I don't know if they hit me or if they threw something out the window... my neck hurts. I think there's glass in my neck.' Scroll down for video . Highway shooting: A bullet passed clean through a woman's neck after she was shot at by an unknown gunman driving down the I-25 highway north of Denver, Colorado . She was taken to hospital where surgeons found she had been shot clean through the neck. Miraculously, the bullet did not damage the woman's airway or sever any major blood vessels. She is expected to recover, according to 7News Denver. The woman, from the nearby town of Milliken, said that she had seen a dark SUV just before her window shattered and she felt the gunshot wound. Deputies from the Weld County Sheriff's Office have said that the shooting may be linked to other unexplained reports of shattered windows on highways in northern Colorado. Hours before the woman was shot, a man's rear window was shattered as he drove on the nearby I-76 after he heard a 'pop' sound which could have been gunfire. The previous day a prison van transporting inmates along the I-25 had its window shattered by an unidentified 'projectile', the Coloradoan\u00a0reported. Another incident came on Thursday, when a man's driver-side window shattered as he drove down a nearby county road during the daytime. Nobody was injured in any of the other incidents. Larimer County Sheriff Justin Smith said drivers should be aware and report suspicious behavior as deputies investigate. 'There's a lot more leg work that needs to be done on this case,' Smith said. 'It's hard because at this point we have no indication that this person was targeted by a person looking for her.' Deputies were yesterday pictured investigating an abandoned black SUV on I-25, which had shattered rear windows. It is not clear whether this was the vehicle the woman had seen.",

The A-list couple want to install air-con in five rooms including the luxury gym and large wine cellar at the \u00a331.5 million west London home. But one neighbour was furious with the proposals, claiming it 'will affect the historic character of the Victorian house of the streets, my house included'. Another Beckham victory:\u00a0David and Victoria have won a planning battle against their next-door neighbour over proposals to install air-conditioning at their new mansion in west London . Portfolio: The couple, pictured, have won planning permission to improve their mansion, which will become their main UK residence. They already have homes in California, France and Dubai . The neighbour expressed 'deep concerns' about the impact of noise, vibration, dirt, pollution and dust from the construction. But other locals gave their support to the Beckhams and the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Council has approved the plans subject to minor conditions. A report from the council said the air-conditioning would have minimal impact on the significance of the listed building and the noise from the units would comply with the borough's criteria. Jonathan Bore, the executive director for planning and development, said: 'The proposals would safeguard the special architectural and historic interest of the listed building, would preserve the character and appearance of the conservation area, would preserve the living conditions of neighbouring occupiers, and would have an acceptable impact on trees.' The Beckhams bought the grand property in Holland Park for \u00a331.5 million in cash in 2013. With the help of designer Rose Uniacke, they are restoring the Grade II listed mansion to its former glory. It is a slow process with photos sent to the council last year showing the house had been stripped ahead of its overhaul. Plans: The first floor will belong to David and Victoria, and boast a huge bedroom, an even bigger dressing room and an en-suite bathroom. The house will include rooms for hairdressing, manicures and make-up, as well as separate rooms for 40-year-old Victoria's shoe collection . Architect's impression: When ready, the property will have six-bedrooms, a gym, study, office, playroom, cinema and large drawing room.

One local described the plans as a 'prudent and sensible set of alterations which will add to the value of the property over the long term'. A neighbour nearby added that councils should be encouraging the likes of the Beckhams to 'restore these beautiful houses to their former glory'. Estate agents have estimated the property could be worth as much as \u00a342 million when completed.

        "article": "Mitchell Keenan, with his father Keith, who had to have his toes amputated after contracting frostbite while being forced to live in a tent . The family of a disabled man claim he had to have all of his toes amputated after he was forced to live in a tent through the winter because he was evicted from his home. Mitchell Keenan, 32, was diagnosed with frostbite six weeks ago after his sister discovered his blackened toes and rushed him to hospital. They were so badly diseased that they could not be saved and they had to be amputated. It came after Mr Keenan had been living in the tent with his father Keith, 62, following their eviction from their four-bedroom home in Skelmersdale, West Lancashire, last year when they fell behind with their repayments. Mr Keenan's father was also diagnosed with severe health problems including malnourishment, scabies and dementia. Mr Keenan's aunt, Dawn Doyle, 54, said: 'It's absolutely outrageous what has happened to my brother and nephew. 'They lived in their home for 30 years and got into difficulty last year. 'They had their benefits sanctioned and things just spiralled out of control. 'They both have neurological conditions and disabilities and kept missing jobs interviews, so the problem got worse and worse. 'In July they lost their home and I tried everywhere to get them accommodation but nowhere would take them.' Ms Doyle says she was then forced to buy her brother and nephew a tent, which they pitched on the Beacon hill in Skelmersdale. She also supplied them with food parcels from local food banks, while trying to provide for her own family. She added: 'I felt awful that I couldn't take them in, but I'm a single parent, with my own disabilities and I just knew I couldn't cope. 'I tried my best for them and contacted so many different organisations, but just kept getting turned away. 'Social Services said they couldn't come and assess them because they were in a tent - it was just farcical. Mr Keenan's toes, which eventually had to be amputated after he caught frostbite from living in a tent during winter after being evicted from his home . 'When we saw Mitchell's toes we were horrified, that this can happen to people in the 21st century is disgusting.' Mr Keenan has now been given temporary accommodation by West Lancashire Borough Council and his father Keith has been taken in by the Stonham housing association. Ms Doyle believes that the problems all stemmed from the government's spare bedroom benefit cuts. She explained: 'The bedroom tax is an awful thing, it's affecting people's lives all over the country and needs to be repealed.' A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: 'Mr Keenan and his son have never been sanctioned and continue to be supported through benefits and by jobcentre staff. 'We have given their local council hundreds of thousands of pounds to support vulnerable people through our housing benefit reforms.'",

        "article": "The Conservatives have opened up a four-point lead over Labour with millions of voters yet to make up their minds about how to vote in the tightest election race since 1992. An exclusive poll by ComRes for the Daily Mail and ITV News shows that David Cameron\u2019s party, on 36 per cent of the vote, has moved ahead in the last fortnight as Labour, the Liberal Democrats and Ukip have all slipped. The Tory vote share equals their highest since March 2012. Labour is on 32 per cent, Ukip on ten per cent and the Liberal Democrats on eight per cent, with the Greens on five per cent. Scroll down for video . David Cameron's (left) Conservative party has opened up a four-point lead over Ed Miliband's (right) Labour with 36 per cent of the vote compared to 32 per cent, a new ComRes poll reveals with just two weeks to go . Crucially, the poll suggests that with less than a fortnight to go, there is all to play for \u2013 with a startling one in five of those who say they are likely to vote still not sure which party they will back. The main parties are evenly split when voters are asked who they would consider backing on May 7, with 48 per cent saying Labour and 47 per cent Conservative. Some 66 per cent say they would never countenance voting Ukip, with 29 per cent saying they would. The poll confirms catastrophic drop in support for the Lib Dems demonstrated in the attitudes of its former voters. Two in five \u2013 41 per cent -- of 2010 Lib Dem voters say that they would not consider voting for the party this year. However, 25 per cent of both Conservative and Labour voters say that they would consider voting Lib Dem, suggesting that the party still has some hope of winning over voters on either side of the political spectrum. Men are slightly more inclined to consider voting for the Conservatives than women \u2013 50 per cent compared to 43 per cent. The reverse is true for the Lib Dems \u2013 25 per cent of men compared to 31 per cent of women, while both genders are equally likely to consider voting Labour, with 48 per cent each. Voters appear relatively relaxed about the rise of smaller parties. Some 75 per cent say it is good to have parties other than the big two in government. Nick Clegg's (left) Liberal Democrats have an eight per cent share of the vote, will Nigel Farage's (right) Ukip has ten per cent. The poll suggests that the Green party has five per cent of the vote ahead of the election . More than half of British adults \u2013 57 per cent -- disagree that a hung parliament places too much power in the hands of smaller parties, and seven in ten \u2013 70 per cent -- disagree that having smaller parties in government is undemocratic. However, the poll shows that Conservative voters are significantly less positive about the increase in support for smaller parties. Almost half of them \u2013 46 per cent \u2013 believe that another hung parliament would give them too much sway. ComRes said the poll showed the Tories had \u2018reinforced their lead\u2019, with Labour yet to be ahead in any telephone survey by the pollster this year. Despite this, the Tories are still \u2018unsure of winning a majority of seats in the Commons\u2019, it added. Tom Mludzinski, head of political polling at ComRes, said: \u2018Our latest poll continues the trend we\u2019ve seen all year, with the Conservatives just, but consistently, ahead of Labour. Despite this lead, both parties have very similar proportions of the electorate willing to consider voting for them. \u2018With just two weeks left and the margin so fine, both Labour and the Conservatives will be exerting most of their efforts on moving people from these pools of potential support into polling booths across the country to make their votes count.\u2019 A more detailed ComRes analysis of undecided voters, involving 1,500 people, will lift Tory spirits.

The two clashed repeatedly on the pitch and Samuels later taunted the Durham all-rounder, saying: \u2018The English boys don\u2019t learn.\u2019 Right-hander Samuels, who is 94 not out after West Indies toiled to 188 for five, said: \u2018Ben Stokes was basically battling himself because he has just come into cricket while I\u2019ve been around for a while. Marlon Samuels says the England players 'don't learn' as he found verbal alternations helpful while batting . Ben Stokes is spoken to by umpire Steve Davis after a heated exchange with Samuels, who is 94 not out . Stokes was taunted by Samuels after the match, playing on his experience of 56 Tests to Stokes's seven . \u2018Tomorrow I\u2019ll have to tell him something different because he\u2019s not listening to me. He keeps on talking to me and he keeps on motivating me to carry on batting. \u2018It all depends on how tomorrow goes,\u2019 said Samuels, who then talked of himself in the third person. \u2018Marlon Samuels with 150 and Ben Stokes with the ball in his hands.

Samuels claimed inexperienced Stokes is 'battling himself' and that England 'can't help' talking to him . Samuels was put on his back by Stuart Broad, who bowled too short on day one but got value for this bouncer . Australian umpire Steve Davis had to step in to calm down Stokes and Samuels after the Englishman\u2019s sledging ended with him hurling the ball in frustration to try to run his opponent out and conceding overthrows. Samuels said: \u2018I can\u2019t tell you what he said, that\u2019s between umpire and players. But the talk between me and Stokes was nothing big.\u2019 The Jamaican should have been caught by Alastair Cook at slip on 32 off Chris Jordan, who said: \u2018Stokesy likes to get in a battle and you saw two cricketers going at it for their country so I guess it makes good viewing. \u2018That kind of stuff makes Stokesy tick. Any time he is in a battle, all of us will back him. It\u2019s good to see two cricketers going at it without crossing the line.\u2019 Stokes had earlier twisted his hip on the greasy outfield and had lengthy treatment.

        "article": "A man sentenced to death in the killings of a baby and her grandmother said he's so dissatisfied with his attorneys he'd rather be executed now than continue seeking a new trial with them. Raghunandan Yandamuri, 29, who had served as his own lawyer before being convicted of murder, accused the attorneys of not responding to his calls or letters. He said Monday in Montgomery County Court if his appeal keeps going the same way he would rather be executed immediately. Raghunandan Yandamuri, 29 (left), of King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, is appealing his death penalty sentence for a murder but says that he would rather be executed than continue with his lawyers. Above, Nov 2012 . Yandamuri was convicted in the grisly stabbing death of Satayrathi Venna, 61 (left) and the suffocation death of her grandchild Saanvi, 10 months (right) Judge Steven O'Neill called that 'a little dramatic.' Attorney Henry Hilles said he and colleague Stephen Heckman have spent more time with their client 'than has ever occurred in Montgomery County history.' 'Mr. Heckman and I met with Mr. Yandamuri at the prison tens and tens and tens of times at his request over the two plus years that we were representing him. It boggles my mind to hear him claim that we have not made ourselves available to him,' Hilles told the\u00a0Times Herald. Yandamuri was a technology professional outside of Philadelphia and knew the baby's parents in what prosecutors called a botched kidnapping plot. The Indian national was given two death sentences in the 2012 slayings of 10-month-old Saanvi Venna and 61-year-old Satayrathi Venna. He was expressionless as the verdict against him, which included up to 62 years in prison for kidnapping, burglary, and abuse of a corpse, was read in October. Prosecutors argued Yandamuri hatched the kidnapping plot to pay for a gambling habit. They said he was mired in gambling debts and told police he committed the crime after losing at least $15,000 at a casino. He told investigators he panicked after the grandmother, who had opened her family's apartment door to him, was killed in a struggle over a kitchen knife he had carried. Yandamuri, an Indian national working as a technology professional outside of Philadelphia, acted as his own lawyer during his trial before his post-conviction hearings were taken over by lawyers . Yandamuri told police he accidentally dropped the baby, put a handkerchief over her mouth to quiet her and tied a towel around her head. He said he then left the baby \u2014 with her dark hair, huge dark eyes and white dress \u2014 in a trash-strewn, unused sauna in a basement fitness center and when he returned hours later with milk for her she was unconscious. Prosecutors said that the man kept the baby in a suitcase in the trunk of his car for days and slashed the elder Venna's throat to the bone. Yandamuri knew the baby's parents, who also were young Indian tech professionals, from his King of Prussia apartment complex. The defendant had gone to a birthday party for the baby's mother, had met the visiting grandmother and used family nicknames in a ransom note demanding $50,000, authorities said. 'They both are working, so I thought maybe they have some money,' Yandamuri told police in a videotaped statement. 'My intention was not to kill anyone or not to harm anyone. I only tried to kidnap the baby.' At trial, though, Yandamuri argued two other men forced him at gunpoint to help and said he was pressured into confessing. 'Mr. Heckman and I met with Mr. Yandamuri at the prison tens and tens and tens of times at his request over the two plus years that we were representing him,' attorney Henry Hilles (pictured) said . He also said during a post conviction sentencing hearing that he would rather receive the death penalty than sit through the hearings where relatives spoke about the victims, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. His mother Padmavathi traveled from India took the stand and said that her son had been traumatized since age ten after his father was killed in a terrorist attack. She said that he had previously tried to kill himself by drinking kerosene. Yandamuri has tried to file motions on his own since the beginning of his appeal, but they cannot be accepted because he is not representing himself. Hilles and Heckman plan on challenging the death penalty as well as alleged bias during Yandamuri's trial. All death penalty cases in Pennsylvania are given automatic appeal up to the state supreme court level. Earlier this year Democratic Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf declared a moratorium on the death penalty, citing bias in proceedings, expense and inefficiency in repeated appeals. The state has not executed anyone since 1999.",

        "article": "Out of prison and free to stroll around Ireland's capital, this is the notorious 'Black Widow' killer who murdered her husband. Catherine Nevin was allowed out on day release on Wednesday afternoon despite being jailed for life in April 2000 for arranging to having her publican husband Tom shot dead. The 62-year-old was permitted to attend an addiction studies course and was pictured leaving Mountjoy prison and making her way from Dublin's Dochas Centre to the Oblates in the city's Inchicore suburb. Black Widow Catherine Nevin leaving Mountjoy Prison as she walks to get a bus. An unsuspecting commuter sat next to her as she made her way through the city centre and to her course in the suburbs . Catherine and Tom Nevin on their wedding day. The 62-year-old was given life in prison for arranging to have her husband shot dead . She walked through the city centre to Dorset Street where she waited for a bus before attending the addiction studies course. Ireland's most infamous woman prisoner went largely unnoticed as she took the bus unaccompanied after leaving prison - with an unsuspecting female commuter sitting down next to her - according the\u00a0Daily Mirror. Catherine Nevin leaving the Central Criminal Court in Dublin during her trial in 2000 . Dressed in jeans, a blue fleece top and a pair of black Ugg boots, Nevin took in sights she hasn't seen since being jailed 15 years ago. She laughed and joked with a pal for more than an hour at the nearby Applegreen Garage before her course started. She failed last July to have her conviction overturned, though this outing will fuel speculation a full release from jail is imminent. Her temporary release is understood to have been approved by the parole board and sanctioned by the Justice Minister. The course is part of her pre-release plan to help her integrate back into society once freed. Nevin's current study leave is her latest educational placement after she studied the same topic at the Mounttown Community Facility in Dun Laoghaire last October. While attending that course, run by the Dun Laoghaire Rathdown Drugs Task Force, she was always accompanied by prison warders. Completion of the course gives participants a FETAC Level 5 Addiction Studies Certificate. It's believed that as well as attending the course in Inchicore, Nevin has also been using facilities at Maynooth University in Co Kildare and Trinity College over the past few weeks. While in prison Nevin has been keeping herself busy. She has a job in the jail library and likes to do makeovers on other inmates. It was revealed in July 2013 how Scissor Sister Charlotte Mulhall, who is serving life for murder, regarded her as a close friend in jail. Despite her high-profile conviction she has never taken responsibility for her role in the murder of Tom and is also still fighting for a share in his substantial estate. Tom Nevin was shot dead in the couple's pub, Jack White's Inn, in Brittas Bay, Co Wicklow, in March 1996. His wife was also convicted of soliciting three men \u2013 Gerry Heapes, William McClean and John Jones \u2013 to kill him. Despite her high-profile conviction she has never taken responsibility for her role in the murder of Tom and is also still fighting for a share in his substantial estate. Her trial was shrouded in controversy and has gone down in history as the longest ever murder trial in the history of Ireland. The trial and media coverage of the case was dominated by an intense focus on Nevin herself, forcing the judge to order a ban on all reporting of her clothing and appearance. No physical evidence linking her to horrific crime was ever discovered. Her conviction was based largely on the evidence of the three men she is alleged to have solicited. Nevin married Galway-born Tom in 1976. Over the following years they built up a property portfolio, before in 1986 buying the landmark pub where Tom was murdered . His death was initially investigated his death as a pub raid which had gone tragically wrong.

        "article": "It is the smallest computer in the world - and 150 of them can fit in a thimble. Called the\u00a0Michigan Micro Mote, to tiny technology is a complete computer system. Its inventors say it can act as a smart sensor, and give everyday objects computing capabilities. The Michigan Micro Mote is the smallest computer in the world, measuring less than 2mm across. The Michigan Micro Mote contains solar cells that power the battery with ambient light, including indoor rooms with no natural sunlight, allowing the computers to run perpetually. This line of 'smart dust' devices includes computers equipped with imagers (with motion detection), temperature sensors, and pressure sensors. By strobing light at a high frequency, the operator is able to send information to the computer. Once the Micro Mote processes the data, it is able to send the information to a central computer via conventional radio frequencies. The Michigan Micro Mote is the first complete, operational computer system measuring as small as two millimeters across. 'To be 'complete,' a computer system must have an input of data, the ability to process that data - meaning process and store it, make decisions about what to do next \u2013 and ultimately, the ability to output the data.' Professor David\u00a0Blaauw explained. 'The sensors are the input and the radios are the output. The other key to being a complete computer is the ability to supply its own power.' The Michigan Micro Mote contains solar cells that power the battery with ambient light, including indoor rooms with no natural sunlight, allowing the computers to run perpetually. This line of 'smart dust' devices includes computers equipped with imagers (with motion detection), temperature sensors, and pressure sensors. They are the culmination of work initiated by Blaauw and Sylvester on very low-power processing for millimeter-scale systems. A key breakthrough in the size/power matchup came with the Phoenix processor in 2008. The Phoenix processor is miniscule at 915 x 915\u00b5m2, and boasts ultra-low operating voltage and a unique standby mode that results in an average power consumption of only 500pW. (Consider that 1pW is the average power consumption of a single human cell.) Blaauw explained why Phoenix's extreme energy efficiency is so important: 'As you shrink down in size, the percentage of the system tends to be dominated by the battery. 'It's actually not hard to make chips small, but it is hard to make them low power. 'We could have very small chips, but we'd still end up with really large batteries.' This line of 'smart dust' devices includes computers equipped with imagers (with motion detection), temperature sensors, and pressure sensors. One key application for this line of smart sensors lies in personal security and information, its inventors say. The solar system allows the computer to work \u00a0under indoor lights without ever having to be charged. 'With a 1mm2 solar cell producing 20nW, the device can harvest enough energy under ambient light to run perpetually,' the team say. The device's standby power consumption is 2nA. That's about a million times less power than the average mobile phone consumes while on standby, or the comparative difference between the thickness of a sheet of paper and the length of a football field. There are currently three different systems in the M3 family, focusing on several different applications: sensing temperature, pressure, and taking images. 'Down the road we want these sensors to be able to talk to one another,' says Blaauw, 'and we're currently working to extend their range to about 20m.' The working computer is smaller than a grain of rice programmed and charged via light and could be used for a variety of medical and industrial purposes. One key application for this line of smart sensors lies in personal security and information. Numerous specks of technology could be discretely placed to invisibly monitor a home, business, or personal device. 'We found that a lot of people were very interested in these devices, and that's why we went with the modular or stacked approach.' Blaauw explained. 'It's the key aspect of our design. If you need a different sensing modality you take out one sensor and replace it with another - like mix and match tinker toys.'",

Granada were torn to shreds by Ronaldo and his Real team-mates as the European champions won 9-1 at the Bernabeu, and their Portuguese talisman managed the first five-goal haul of his career. His record of 36 league goals for the season overtook Lionel Messi's 32 strikes, and put him in the incredible position of having scored more goals than 53 of the 98 teams in Europe's top five leagues this season. Cristiano Ronaldo scored an incredible five goals against Granada to lift his tally for the season to 36 . Granada were torn to shreds by Ronaldo and his Real team-mates as the European champions won 9-1 . The Portuguese star now has more goals than 53 teams in Europe's top leagues, including nine in England . There are nine teams in the Barclays Premier League who have managed fewer goals in the league than Cristiano Ronaldo has this season. They are: . Stoke City, Newcastle United, West Bromwich Albion, Hull City, Aston Villa, Sunderland, Queens Park Rangers, Burnley and Leicester City. Ronaldo took some flak last month after a series of poor performances for Real, but his goalscoring has never waivered and even through a difficult period he managed six goals in 10 games, the sort of record most strikers can only dream of. And his displays across the season have brought more goals than the likes of Newcastle United, Malaga, Borussia Dortmund, Torino and Lille. The first three of his five goals against Granada marked the quickest hat-trick of his career, coming in just eight first half minutes. Another followed 16 minutes later, and his last came 35 minutes after that. Ronaldo's\u00a0displays across the season have brought more goals than the likes of Borussia Dortmund and Lille . It all adds up to a brilliant Easter Sunday for the world's best player, and he spoke of his delight afterwards . Lionel Messi and Barcelona came out on top in El Clasico but he has fewer league goals than Ronaldo . Borussia Dortmund, who can boast Marco Reus among their ranks, have fewer goals than the Real talisman . While Ronaldo overtook Messi on the goalscoring charts, the hat-trick - which could have been doubled - levelled the Argentine's record of 24 La Liga trebles. He almost matched Real legend Alfredo Di Stefano's 28 hat-tricks for Los Blancos in what was their biggest league win in 48-and-a-half years. It all adds up to a brilliant Easter Sunday for the world's best player, and he posted on Twitter after the game, saying: 'Happy to have scored 5 goals with this excellent team work. Thank you for all your support.' If the critics still see Ronaldo as greedy, it certainly paid off at the Santiago Bernabeu on Sunday.

Janet and John Brennan have spent eight years and hundreds of thousands of pounds turning Barholm Castle, in Dumfries and Galloway, from a ruin into a stylish castle home. They bought the 15th Century fort, reputed to have been used by leader of the Scottish Protestant Reformation John Knox as a hiding place, for just \u00a365,000. Barnholm Castle in Dumfries and Galloway, which has gone on the market for \u00a3695,000 after being transformed from old ruins . John and Janet Brennan (right) bought Barnholm Castle (left) for just \u00a365,000 in 1997 and have spent hundreds of thousands of pounds renovating it . But now it is on the market for offers over \u00a3695,000 even though at that price the couple will lose a six-figure sum. However, despite that, Janet, 60, and John, 64, insist the project was a 'labour of love' and they have 'no regrets'. The Brennans first stumbled upon the castle near Gatehouse of Fleet - once home to a branch of the powerful McCulloch clan - in 1997 when it was just a shell of crumbling stone walls. It took two years to complete the purchase, four years to get planning permission and three years of restoration. The castle's large living area, pictured, was formerly the great hall in the fortress, which is thought to have once housed Scottish minister John Knox . Barnholm Castle's great vault is now the luxury home's kitchen, which is big enough for a dining table and all modern appliances . One of the four bedrooms in the \u00a3700,000 property.

Even though the property is on the market for \u00a3695,000, the couple have spent hundreds of thousands restoring the castle meaning they will actually incur a loss . The grade A-listed building was lovingly transformed into a stunning home while staying true to its historical roots. Mrs Brennan, the chairwoman of the Scottish Castles Association, admitted: 'The restoration cost more than the asking price but it was a labour of love - we were not doing it for profit. 'We've no regrets. Other people take up golf and they buy boats. We bought a castle.' The retired university lecturer added: 'It was a massive project.

It took two years to fully restore the castle after planning permission was granted. It also has stunning sea views over Wigtown Bay . A decorator paints the ceiling during the castle's restoration. Mrs Brennan says the newly refurbished property would be a fabulous holiday home . 'We were driving and saw a sign on the road saying castle for sale. 'When we drove up the narrow, winding track and saw it we fell in love with it. It was love at first sight. 'We were always interested in castles and visited them over the years. But it was a spur of the moment decision. 'We saved it. It was described as being in a precarious condition.' The castle now has rooms over four floors as well as stunning sea views over Wigtown Bay. The ground floor vaulted chamber has been converted into a kitchen while the great hall has been transformed into a large living space. Four bedrooms are found on the upper floors, including one said to have been used to shelter John Knox.

She described the restoration project as a labour of love . Meanwhile a staircase in the turret leads to upper cap house chamber, with a door to the roof parapet. Mrs Brennan, who has written a book on the subject of restoring castle, added: 'It's an enjoyable experience living in the house. 'It's not that we're selling because we want to leave it - we want to be closer to family. 'I think it would make a fabulous holiday home for someone with deep pockets. 'Or a home for a retired couple who want to live somewhere really special.' John Knox was a Scottish clergyman, who was the leader of the Protestant Reformation in Scotland and often considered the founder of the Presbyterian denomination. He was a Catholic deacon and priest but first joined the movement to reform the Scottish church in the early 1500s. He then went on to teach a number of sons of Protestants who had been captured in St Andrews Castle and called on Knox to become their minister. It was at this time that he is believed to have used Barholm as a place of refuge. In 1547 he was captured by the French, who attacked St Andrews Castle and was kept as a prisoner for over a year. On his release, he travelled to London, where he continued to attack the Roman Catholic faith but left the UK again in 1553 when Mary I became Queen. When he returned to Scotland, he realised how much the teaching of the Reformers was spreading. He then became one of the most well-known preachers in Scotland, with the Scottish Reformation taking place n 1560. Knox is credited with helping to write the Scots Confession of Faith, one of the first formal documents of the Church of Scotland.",

        "article": "A pregnant meteorologist has called out the bullies who viciously attacked her appearance by reading their hateful messages on air - before admitting that their cruel words had taken their toll on her. Kristi Gordon, of British Columbia's news channel Global BC, was joined by her fellow anchors\u00a0Robin Stickley and Squire Barnes as they reflected upon the degrading comments the mom has received about her second pregnancy on an episode of the online-only news segment\u00a0News Hour Plus\u00a0- with her reading some of the message aloud. 'Nowhere on North America TV have we seen a weather reader so gross as you (sic),' Kristi read from one of the messages. 'Your front end looks like the Hindenburg and rear end a brick - fill in the blank - house.' Scroll down for video . Taking a stand: Pregnant TV meteorologist Kristi Gordon called out the online bullies who attacked her appearance during the online only segment\u00a0News Hour Plus . The online bullies, who left no name or return address, added: 'We now turn off Global. Cover up or take time off. The Group.' Kristi, who is due to give birth in three months, explained that she received the harsh message the day before she taped the March 26 segment and admitted that it 'kicked off a bit of a conversation'. She and her co-anchors laughed the comments off, particularly the group's misspelling of the word Global. 'First of all, if you are going to diss us, please learn how to spell,' Squire noted, before he explained that Global is spelled with an 'a' - not an 'e' like the group had written. And while they joked about the bizarre jibe, it wasn't the only scathing message Kristi had received regarding her pregnancy and her wardrobe. 'Buy some decent clothes and have more respect for your unborn child. You're not the first pregnant woman OMG,' another critic had written. Someone else advised her: 'Looser tops would look much more professional.' Harsh words: Kristi, who can be seen giving a weather report, was also criticized for wearing form-fitting clothing because 'looser tops would look more professional' After Kristi finished reading the messages, Squire joked: 'Haters gonna hate as some rapper may have said,' before Robin interjected: 'Taylor Swift, I think actually said that.' Kristi revealed that she was actually expecting these types of messages because she had received a similar level of hateful jibes during her first pregnancy. Refusing to cover up and hide her pregnant body however, she stood up to show her growing baby bump and said: 'You can't really hide something like this.' 'I feel like I am pretty confident person,' she added. 'I wouldn't be in this industry if I wasn't. I don't feel that this is really affecting me or has affected me.' But Kristi went on to say that, subconsciously, her critics' hurtful words had gotten to her. That night she found herself checking her own reflection in the mirror to see how big her baby bump had grown. She asked her husband if she looked bigger than she had thought, and when went to bed that night, she realized it was her critics' harsh words that were driving her actions. Kristi noted: 'It's amazing when you say something mean about someone, it still affects them.' Baby bumps: Kristi posed for this funny photo in the green room at Global News . Family time: Kristi and her husband Paul Klawer can be seen sitting in the crowed with their son Jordan . 'Even if you are joking, it sinks in at some level,' she continued. 'I was not impressed with myself when I got into bed yesterday and thought about what I had done through the evening hours. It obviously had affected me. The day after the online segment aired, Kristi wrote about her account on the Global News website. She first thanked fans who reached out to her to share their outrage over the feedback she has received throughout her pregnancy. 'For those of you emailing to say I look great and to keep my head up \u2014 THANK YOU! Please also share a kind comment to the person next to you,' Kristi wrote. She went on to thank 'The Group' who wrote her such a vicious letter because it taught her an important lesson. 'No matter how rational or confident you are, the mean things people say can have an impact,' she explained. 'The negative thoughts seep in when you don\u2019t even realize it. Even a little joking comment could do some damage. Hopefully this can help us all be more aware of our impact on others.'",

        "article": "Ed Miliband this morning launched a furious attack on David Cameron and other EU leaders for leaving refugees to drown by stopping search and rescue missions in the Mediterranean. The Labour leader said it was unacceptable to abandon thousands of immigrants boarding makeshift boats in Africa in the hope of making it to Europe. He also called on the UK to take a 'fare share' of refugees fleeing civil war. Mr Miliband's remarks came amid growing alarm over the number of desperate families risking their lives to escape the raging civil wars in the Middle East and North Africa. Scroll down for video . The Labour leader said it was unacceptable to abandon thousands of immigrants boarding makeshift boats in Africa in the hope of making it to Europe . Around 1,300 people are believed to have drowned in the past two weeks while trying to reach Europe in boats launched from Libya. Speaking in Manchester this morning, Mr Miliband attacked the decision to abandon European rescue missions. He said: 'The original decision was a mistake and it should be reversed.' Mr Miliband said: 'The logic is we are leaving people to die because it is a pull factor. We are better than that. We can't be leaving people to drown.' Earlier, he said: 'We cannot stand by as people drown in European waters simply to escape conflict in Libya and Syria. If I was prime minister, I would be working with other European leaders to act.' Local residents and rescue workers help a migrant woman after a boat carrying migrants sank off the island of Rhodes, southeastern Greece, yesterday . Around 1,300 people are believed to have drowned in the past two weeks while trying to reach Europe in boats launched from Libya . But senior Conservative minister William Hague insisted that the rescue missions had not helped. He also defended the Government's intervention in Libya in Libya 2011, helping to overthrow Colonel Gaddafi. He said it would be 'wrong to think that whatever's happened in Libya in the last few years is the cause of this'. Tunisian Mohammed Ali Malek, 27, was arrested when in Sicily last night some 24 hours after his overcrowded boat capsized in the Mediterranean killing hundreds of migrants . He added on BBC Radio 5live: 'Let me remind you of something as well, which is that when Colonel Gaddafi was still in power, there were periods when he simply allowed people to do exactly this, to get into boats and try to go to Europe \u2013 that was one of the ways in which he put pressure on Europe. 'So I don't think that is the change in this situation; I think this is a problem that goes well beyond Libya.' The Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg, said the priority for stopping the migrant crisis had to be to stop people boarding boats rather than stepping up patrols in the Mediterranean. He said: '[It is] the human traffickers and smugglers who are peddling this terrible trade which is leading to so many people dying in the Mediterranean. 'And I think if we can do [tackle] that and provide more aid and assistance in North Africa to encourage people to stay put rather than risk life and limb moving great distances, that it seems to me is a more sustainable solution than coming up with lots of arbitrary numbers about who takes in which number of migrants from North Africa. And that's where the focus of our attention should be in the summit tomorrow.' The political row over how to tackle the crisis was sparked after 950 men, women and children drowned this week. Survivors told of how women and children died 'like rats in a cage' after being locked into the boat's hold by callous traffickers in Libya. Some resorted to clinging to their floating corpses until Italian and Maltese coastguards came to rescue them in the dead of the night. Elsewhere three people died when a rickety wooden boat ran aground on the Greek island of Rhodes. Among them was a tiny child whose lifeless body was carried to the shore by a local man who had waded in to try to save him. Sunday morning: Italian coastguard responds to migrant ship after it capsizes off the coast of Libya with 700 passengers unaccounted for . Sunday afternoon: Passengers accounts of the ship say as many as 950 people may have been on board with 300 locked in the hull. Another boat is rescued off Sicily carrying 100 Syrian refugees. They are all brought to safety . Monday morning: A boat runs aground on the Greek holiday island of Rhodes killing a man, woman and child . Monday afternoon: Italian and Milanese coastguards respond to two distress calls off the coast of Libya from boats thought to be carrying up to 400 people. EU heads of state call for urgent action to ease the migrant crisis with an emergency summit called for later in the week . Monday at midnight: The surviving passengers of the Libyan boat arrive in Catania, Sicily. Among them is the crew's Tunisian captain and his Syrian crew member. Both were arrested and charged with 'favouring illegal immigration'. The captain was additionally charged with multiple manslaughter.",

        "article": "Kevin Pietersen battered Oxford\u2019s students for 170 off 149 deliveries in his first game of red-ball cricket for 15 months \u2013 then insisted the incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves has told him everyone has a \u2018clean slate\u2019. Pietersen\u2019s quest for an improbable return to international cricket began as his scriptwriter must have known it would: with sumptuous strokes, a standing ovation and much of the old bravado. The fact that his first hundred since the Old Trafford Test against Australia in August 2013 came against a modest attack, at a windswept Oxford, in a game not deemed first-class, is beside the point. Pietersen\u2019s only hope of playing for England again is to score lots of runs for Surrey \u2013 wind, rain or shine. Here was the first box ticked, in style. Surrey's Kevin Pietersen (right) celebrates reaching his 100 during the three-day Match at The Parks . Pietersen makes his way out to the crease following the dismissal of Rory Burns . It was the 34-year-old's first appearance for Surrey since the LV= County Championship in June 2013 . Asked what Graves had said to him when the pair spoke over the phone last month, Pietersen replied: \u2018He said he wants the best players playing for England, and everyone has a clean slate. Right now, it\u2019s just about me hitting the red ball. I think it can help England going forward. \u2018I took confidence from the way I played in Australia [at the Big Bash]. It was as well as I\u2019ve ever batted. I\u2019ve been given a lifeline, and I have an opportunity to get back to doing something I love that was taken away from me prematurely.\u2019 England meet West Indies in Antigua on Monday, and comparisons will be inevitable. There will be mixed feelings both in the Caribbean and at Lord\u2019s. Whether Pietersen\u2019s journey will prove more futile than fruitful is another matter. The first aim of the new regime at the ECB has been to stop the sniping; the second may be to keep Pietersen sweet in case English cricket needs him after he retires, possibly in a mentoring capacity. Regardless, the evidence here \u2013 as if it were required \u2013 suggested he is deadly serious about reclaiming his place. Pietersen has played exclusively Twenty20 cricket throughout the world since being axed by England . A young spectator points to a dent in her mother's car made by one of Pietersen's shots . Pietersen made 62 on his only prior appearance at The Parks, for Nottinghamshire in April 2004 . With Surrey 122 for five at lunch, Pietersen (left) found himself on 47 not out from 58 balls . Nearly 10 years on from his Ashes-clinching century at The Oval, Pietersen cannot have imagined he would need to prosper in the Parks simply to stay afloat. But in front of a crowd of several hundred \u2013 almost unheard of in these parts \u2013 and with Surrey stumbling to 113 for five, he had a captive audience and a job to do. Pietersen was careful at first, waiting until his eighth delivery to pinch his first run in red-ball cricket since the Sydney Test of January 2014, and not finding the boundary until his 31st. Then he opened up. His fifty came from 63 balls, his hundred from 110, and his 150 from 137. By the time he was out for 170, caught at mid-on off the bowling of Abidine Sahande, a human sciences undergrad from St John\u2019s College, the total was only 310. He knocked one spectator off his stool with a fierce drive, dented a Peugeot 207 with the first of two successive straight sixes, and unveiled his full repertoire. Stealing headlines and causing damage, Pietersen might never have been away. Pietersen's inclusion in Surrey's line-up attracted several hundred spectators and a number of photographers .",

Stephanie Hannon, who was the tech giant's\u00a0director of productmanagement for civic innovation and social impact, will serve as her presidential campaign's chief technology officer. In that role she will supervise a sprawling effort to develop websites, mobile apps and other vehicles for pushing the former secretary of state's brand through the 2016 elections. Hannon previously worked on Gmail and Google Maps. She also spent some time at Facebook, and also worked for the event-organizing website Eventbrite, according to her LinkedIn profile. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . DEADLY SERIOUS: Clinton, 67, is priming the pump for a digital outreach campaign tailored to the expectations of younger, more tech-savvy voters . SECOND TIME AROUND: Clinton ran unsuccessfully for president in 2008, but the online landscape has evolved since then . That profile describes her Google projects as including 'changing how the world prepares and responds to natural disasters, using big data and experiments to enable cities to make evidenced based decisions and sharing transparent election ballot, candidate and results globally.' Stephanie Hannon, director of product management, civic innovation and social impact at Google, has come aboard the Hillary Express as Mrs. Clinton's technology guru . Seasoned digital talent is in high demand as nearly 20 potential White House hopefuls plan for a 2016 campaign season that will rely heavily on clicks, likes, shares and other indications of a broad reach. Every major party candidate will have to navigate the brave new world of online fundraising, too, which President Barack Obama's team mastered in 2008 en route to his victory \u2013 including a stunning Democratic primary upset of Clinton. Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul, who announced his candidacy on Tuesday in Louisville, poached his tech leader from rival candidate Ted Cruz late last year. Vincent Harris, who also helped manicure Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell's online image during a bruising re-election fight in 2014, runs his own Texas consulting firm\u00a0with a staff of 20. His team was responsible for McConnell's breakthrough video 'What rhymes with Alison Lundergan Grimes,' a brief online ad that launched a year-long slap-fest directed at McConnell's unsuccessful challenger.

The Washington Post\u00a0was first to report Clinton's latest hire. The onetime first lady and former U.S. senator hasn't yet launched an official campaign, but an announcement is expected in the next 10 days. Her campaign-in-waiting has already signed a lease for two floors of a Brooklyn, New York, office building, starting a 15-day countdown for a formal declaration of her candidacy set by the Federal Election Commission. Clinton's staff also includes several key members who came over from the White House. Kristina Schake was first lady Michelle Obama's aide responsible for recasting her as a fun-loving 'everywoman' through TV appearances on pop-culture shows. She will help transform Clinton into a softer, more accessible public figure. White House Communications Director Jen Palmieri stepped down this month to helm Clinton's campaign communications team. Palmieri has been replaced by Jen Psaki, the former State Department chief spokeswoman. EMAIL-GATE: South Carolina Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy hasn't let go of demands for Clinton's home-brew email server, which contained her correspondence from the State Department until she erased it . It's unclear whether Hannon will be able to help Clinton shed her image as a ham-fisted and digitally aloof schemer, a reputation that has followed her since a scandal broke over emails she deleted froma private server she maintained during her years in the Obama administration. Questions remain about whether Clinton acted improperly when she conducted all her State Department email communications on a home-brew system completely separate from government computers and the archiving required by federal law. South Carolina Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy, at the helm of a special congressional committee tasked with investigating the deadly 2012 terror attacks at a State Department facility in Benghazi, Libya, did not respond to a request for comment about the status of the probe into Clinton's emails.",

The Manchester middleweight takes on Dollaway in Montreal on Saturday night bidding to avoid losing successive fights for the first time in his career. And assuming he does so, Bisping is open to fighting again in Glasgow this July, five years since he last fought in the UK. Michael Bisping gets up close to CB Dolloway during the UFC 186 weigh-in at Metropolis on Friday . \u2018I know it\u2019s a cliche but I feel like I\u2019m in the best shape of my life. I\u2019m ready to take on the world, and by world I mean CB Dollaway,\u2019 he said. \u2018For me it\u2019s just another day in the office. This is what I love to do, this is what I was put on this earth to do. \u2018Make no mistake, I\u2019m going to deliver for the fans in Montreal. \u2018He\u2019s going to look for a takedown, I\u2019m going to stop that takedown. \u2018I\u2019m in the best training situation of my life \u2013 if I had this type of training my entire career, I\u2019d have been a world champion five years ago.

Bisping is coming off the back of a defeat by Luke Rockhold last November but still considers himself among the best in the world. \u2018I\u2019m expecting the best CB Dollaway there is, and I expect him to be confident. But his courage will diminish as the fight goes on, and I will knock him out,\u2019 he added. \u2018CB Dollaway is a very good athlete. He\u2019s a great wrestler, he\u2019s a mediocre striker \u2013 I\u2019m by far a better striker. \u2018I\u2019ve never lost two fights back to back. I need to put a win streak together.

        "article": "Battered, rusted and covered in overgrown weeds, this unremarkable looking bus and train were used to film one of the most memorable Hollywood action scenes of the past 25 years. Lying abandoned in the Great Smokey Mountains in North Carolina, fans of 1993 film The Fugitive will recognize them as those used by Harrison Ford's character Dr Richard Kimble when he escaped from a prison transport moments before it collided with the onrushing train. The scene, which was filmed using a real train hitting a real bus, cost an eye-watering $1.5million to shoot while the remains of the vehicles were left on location where they have since become a popular tourist attraction. Scroll down for video . The wreckage of the bus and train used in the dramatic scene from The Fugitive lie abandoned in the Great Smokey Mountains in North Carolina . The vehicles were used to film a scene in which Harrison Ford's character leaps from a prison transport moments before it is struck by the onrushing train . Signage identifying the bus as a prison transport for the purposes of the film remains on its front . Across its side, the lettering reads 'Illinois Dept. of Corrections' in accordance with the film's plot . The wreckage has since become a tourist attraction 23 years after the memorable action scene was shot . Harrison Ford's character Dr Richard Kimble is pictured leaping off the bus in the scene where he escapes while being transported to prison . The Fugitive was the must-see film of 1993, winning plaudits from critics and the audience alike. It grossed a staggering $370million. Fans of the film will recognise the inside of the bus where Kimble tried in vain to save prison officers and fellow inmates, before narrowly avoiding certain death by jumping from the vehicle seconds before the train hit. 'Illinois Dept. Of Corrections' can still be seen written on the trashed prison bus in accordance with the film's plot. The trains were bought specifically for the epic scene at $22,000 per carriage. The crew used pusher trains to make it go faster for a bigger impact. The 100 strong crew spent two months on location in the Great Smokey Mountains in North Carolina to carefully plan the impact, which lasted a heart-stopping 60 seconds. The short action sequence cost an eye-watering $1.5million to shoot as it used only minimal CGI . Director Andrew Davis used 13 cameras to film the scene and three were destroyed in the process . The inside of the bus will be familiar to fans of the film as the location where Harrison Ford's character attempts to free fellow prisoners before leaping out of the path of the oncoming train . The train is now covered in grass and weeds after sitting abandoned for more than two decades . Director Andrew Davis used 13 cameras to film the scene; three were destroyed in the process. Most camera were operated remotely so to avoid injury to cameramen. Speaking in 2013, Mr Davis said: 'I'm glad CGI wasn't available when we made the Fugitive, not only was the train crash very effective because you really felt it and saw it, but the next day when the marshals show up and there's aerials of it, that would've been a nightmare to try and put all that in digitally and have people reacting to nothingness.' According to Mr Davis, what you see in the sequence is 95 per cent real footage. The only part that was super-imposed was the moment Kimble leaps out of the way of the train. In the film, the bus is a prison transport which crashes when fellow prisoners attempt an escape . Harrison Ford's character Dr Richard Kimble escapes when the bus lands in a ravine in the path of an oncoming train . Despite being shackled around the feet, he manages to narrowly avoid being hit by the derailed train .",

        "article": "The blood of hundreds of baby seals has stained the pristine white snow of Canada's ice floes as the world's largest annual marine mammal slaughter begins. Horrifying images taken only yesterday show seals being shot and wounded before they are dragged onto a vessel - where they clubbed to death for their fur. Photographs of this year's commercial hunt off the coast of Newfoundland were captured by animal rights charity Humane Society International (HSI) who say the baby animals 'are dying a violent death for fur products that nobody is buying'. Horrific: Humane Society International has captured shocking images of seals being clubbed to death on Canada's ice floes (pictured) as this year's 'commercial hunt' gets underway . Cruel: Images show the animals - who are eventually skinned for their fur - being shot and wounded on the thin ice before being dragged (pictured) onto vessels . Chilling: The seals who do not die from the gunshot wounds are dragged onto ships (pictured) where they are clubbed to death . Gruesome: The baby animals (pictured) are suffering a violent death 'for fur products nobody wants' according to Humane Society International . Inhumane: Some seals die from the gunshot wounds (top) while others escape into the water where they slowly die from their injuries (bottom) Blood-stained: Once the animals are shot, sealers retrieve the bodies by impaling them with a sharpened hook (pictured) which forces the seals that are still alive to violently thrash out . Cruel: The images HSI took from a helicopter above Newfoundland's ice floes show sealers (pictured) pulling the seal's blood-stained carcasses onto their ship . The disturbing images show the animals thrashing in pain as they are pulled across the blood-stained snow while others are seen impaled on the boat's deck. HSI's executive director Rebecca Aldworth said: 'This is the 17th year that I have witnessed the seal slaughter. The suffering I have seen is impossible to forget.\u00a0If the killing happened in view of the public, it would have been shut down decades ago. But it occurs far offshore. 'We saw one baby seal clearly raise her head from the massive pool of blood she lay in. Another was shot and thrashed on the ice only to slip into the blood-slicked water. 'It is reprehensible that these baby seals are being killed with government financing, even as the largest seal processor in Canada admits to warehousing a stockpile of seal fur.' The Newfoundland government has authorised the killing of up to 468,000 harp, hooded and grey seals, according to HSI.\u00a0They claim the seals - many of which are just a few weeks old - are shot, clubbed and skinned for their fur despite a decreasing global demand for them. Killing: Even Sir Paul McCartney who visited a seal nursery with HSI in 2006 has made an emotional plea for Canada to stop the seal hunt (pictured) Unforgiving: The animals are slaughtered in a remote region off the coast of Newfoundland (pictured) - HSI says if the killing happened in view of the public 'it would have been shut down decades ago' Brutal: Veterinary experts claim the seals are killed inhumanely in the commercial hunt (pictured) because of the harsh environment in which it occurs and the speed at which they are killed . Barbaric: HSI's executive director says 'it is reprehensible that these baby seals (pictured) are being killed with government financing' Demand: The country's largest purchaser of sealskin announced that it will no longer purchase the fur from seals who are killed and skinned (pictured) during commercial hunts . Innocent: Government reports found 98 percent of the seals (pictured) killed in the Canadian commercial seal slaughter are less than three months of age, according to HSI . The demand for seal products diminished greatly after the European Union, United States, Switzerland, Mexico, Taiwan and the Customs Union of Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Armenia banned the trade of some or all products of commercial seal hunts. With China also blocking attempts to import seal meat into the country, the price of seal products from Canada declined rapidly and convinced many 'sealers' to abandon the act. Sir Paul McCartney who visited a seal nursery with HSI in 2006 has made an emotional plea for Canada to stop the seal hunt. The former Beatle said: 'Canada's brutal commercial seal hunt has begun, and once again thousands of baby seals will be shot and bludgeoned to make fur products that nobody wants or needs. 'Videos of the bloody seal slaughter provide the only vital evidence to demonstrate year after year that these seals are dying a horrible death for their fur.' In recent years, Newfoundland's government has reportedly dished out \u00a36million in subsidies to seal processing plants to 'prop up the dying industry' - and announced a further \u00a31.3million earlier this month. 'It is a double tragedy,' according to HSI spokesperson Wendy Higgins who told MailOnline: 'They [seals] are suffering for frivolous fur products and Canada can't even sell the fur because more and more countries around the world are boycotting sales because of the horrendous cruelty.' 'We want the Canadian government to offer a buy-out to the sealers and put and end to this senseless slaughter. 'The hunt is legal but that doesn't mean that the killing is always done according to what few guidelines govern the industry and HSI has frequently documented breaches. 'Even if they did always kill the seals according to the rules, it's still a dreadfully brutal process... This hunt is taking place many hundreds of miles out with absolutely no-one there to monitor what they're doing.' Immoral: Even though the hunt (pictured) is legal in Canada, animal rights campaigners say\u00a0it's still a dreadfully brutal process . Shocking: The Newfoundland government has authorised the killing of up to 468,000 seals (pictured) this year, despite declining global demand for their fur . Hunted: The boss of a company who accepted government funds to continue purchasing sealskin said 'it's probably not a really good time to get in this industry' Death: As many as half-a-million seals (pictured) will be hunted and killed in this year's cull . Only this week the country's largest purchaser of sealskin announced that it will no longer purchase seal fur, citing a lack of demand and a warehouse full of it. Carino Processing Ltd\u00a0also refused over \u00a3600,000 in financing from the Newfoundland government. But a new company PhocaLux International\u00a0is accepting government funds and has stated it will purchase around 30,000 seal furs, according to CBC. The firm's Chief Executive told the news channel 'the markets aren't really great around the world... it's probably not a really good time to get in this industry.' Government reports confirmed that 98 percent of the seals killed in the Canadian commercial seal slaughter are pups less than three months of age, according to HSI. Veterinary experts have stated that Canada's commercial seal hunt is inherently inhumane because of the remote, harsh environment in which it occurs and the speed at which the killing is conducted for commercial and safety reasons.",

The Chelsea shot-stopper looks certain to leave Stamford Bridge at the end of the season after losing the No 1 spot to Thibaut Courtois. Cech will hold talks with manager Jose Mourinho at the end of the season where the keeper will confirm his decision to leave west London. Arsenal must make a swift decision on Petr Cech this summer or risk losing out on the goalkeeper . The Chelsea stopper looks certain to leave Stamford Bridge at the end of the season after losing his No 1 spot . Arsene Wenger must be swift with a move for his top goalkeeping target to beat the competition to him . The Gunners are long-term admirers of Cech and are considering a move for the keeper ahead of next season. However, Arsenal will not be the only club interested in luring Cech when the transfer window reopens. Liverpool, Paris Saint-Germain, Roma and Inter Milan are all showing an interest in the 32-year-old and Cech is understood to be keen on resolving his future as quickly as possible this summer. That means the Gunners could miss out on their primary goalkeeping target if they don't make an early move. However, there are some major obstacles Arsenal must overcome before landing Cech. The first is the goalkeeper's valuation. Despite the fact Cech enters the final year of his contract this summer, Chelsea will demand in excess of \u00a310million for the custodian. Thibaut Courtois has become Chelsea's first choice goalkeeper after three years on loan at Atletico Madrid . Chelsea's stance over their players joining rivals weakened with the sale of Juan Mata to Manchester United . The Blues believe Cech can play for at least another eight seasons and that his next club will be signing a world class goalkeeper in his prime. His price will reflect that view. Likewise, the Gunners may find that Chelsea are reluctant to sell them Cech. In recent years, the Blues have shown a hesitancy in selling players to their Premier League rivals, though that stance weakened last season with Juan Mata's exit to Manchester United. Cech and Courtois have spent a season sharing the gloves at Chelsea, but the veteran will now move on . Signing Cech would significantly strengthen the Gunners next season, and Chelsea could yet refuse to sell the keeper to their London rivals. Cech would consider moving to the Emirates Stadium, despite spending over 10 years with Chelsea, and hopes his long period of service will allow him to make the final decision on his next destination.",

        "article": "Hanging on one 93-year-old man's wall at a Kentucky nursing home was a photo collage of him and his wife. It was titled 'Lill & Bill, together forever'. That sentiment came true this week when, after 73 years of marriage, William 'Wild Bill' Wilson and his wife Lillian Karr Wilson died just two minutes apart from each other. Both Lillian, 89, and Bill were Alzheimer's patients and for the last couple of years had to live in separate nursing homes. Lillian resided at Richmond Place in Lexington, while Bill stayed at the Thomson-Hood Veterans Center in Wilmore. After 73 years of marriage, high school sweethearts Doug Wilson, 93, and Lillian Kerr Wilson, 89, passed away just two minutes apart from each other this week . But on Tuesday their connection proved strong as ever when one of their sons, Doug, received a phone call at 3.52am to inform him that his father had passed away. Just five minutes later the phone rang again. Doug said it was his mother's nursing home, calling with the same sad news. 'We all look at it as a blessing,' Doug told the Lexington-Herald Leader, 'because we're going to have one funeral for both of them.' Doug, 66, believes it will also make it easier for the family to grieve. 'We\u2019re looking at it as a celebration of life because they had a great life,' he told the Washington Post. The couple first met in Corbin, where they were both athletes and high school sweethearts. Doug told the Lexington-Herald Leader that his parents ran off to get married and that he doesn't believe 'either one of them had the blessings of their parents.' But that didn't stop the couple, who survived a war and a number of relocations through their long marriage. Bill enlisted in the Army when World War II began. After returning from Germany, he worked and managed various department and retail stores. Doug told the Washington Post that his mother, who he said 'had great taste', could be found working alongside her husband as she designed the showroom windows. The family, which also included Doug's brothers Mike and Terry, hopped around the state and country. There were setbacks along the way. The couple\u00a0unsuccessfully\u00a0tried to open a shopping center in Atlanta and then one of Bill's department stores burned down and couldn't reopen after they moved back to Kentucky. The couple first met in Corbin, Kentucky and, according to their son Doug, ran off and got married without either of their parents' blessing. They spent their lives supporting and working alongside each other . But Doug said his parents had a 'driving force' to make sure their three sons received the college education they never got to have. 'They stressed college so much,' Doug said. 'And they were so proud that they had three sons who had college degrees.' And there were successes. After managing a number of stores, Bill decided to open his own realty firm. It grew from an $800 investment into a $1million-dollar company. He would also flip foreclosures, remodeling the houses before putting them back on the market. Meanwhile Lillian would repaint, wallpaper and do the trim work on the homes while Doug did the carpentry work. 'We had a great time rehabbing houses together,' he said. Bill was also known for his long-running morning radio show, where he was known as 'Wild Bill' and would organize a number of promotions and contests, including a twist-dancing competition that was so popular the police had to be brought in. The nickname stuck with Bill long after his radio show ended. He was even called 'Wild Bill' at his nursing home, where he would sometimes reenact his show in the cafeteria. Doug said he regularly drove his mother to see her husband at the Veterans center. He said that, although the couple 'didn't have communication', he believes they were 'reading each other' just by having the chance to see each other. When Doug last saw his father the Sunday before his passing, he said Bill was wearing an oxygen mask and was 'barely hanging on'. To comfort him, Doug recited the opening that Bill used to say for every one of his radio shows. 'I just told him, \"This is Wild Bill Wilson, your red-headed, freckle-faced, snaggle-toothed, snuff-dipping buddy\"'. 'And underneath the mask there, he grinned real big. He heard it. I was glad of that.' Friends and family will gather on Saturday evening for a 'Celebration of life' service in honor of the devoted couple.",

        "article": "Photos marking the 50th anniversary of New York City's Landmarks Law look at the devastating architectural losses that led up to the law and how it has helped preserve beautiful old buildings as new construction sprouts up around them. Saving Place, which opens Tuesday at the Museum of the City of New York, highlights what is widely seen as a watershed moment in the city's preservation movement, the 1963 demolition of the old Beaux Arts-style Pennsylvania Station to make way for Madison Square Garden. 'Nobody really believed that a building of such civic importance would be demolished,' said Meenakshi Srinivasan, an architect and chairman of the Landmarks Preservation Commission. 'It really created the coalescing of all factors to come together to save buildings important to New York City's identity.' Scroll down for video . A new exhibition from the Museum of the City of New York shows the former landmarks that were destroyed before they could be preserved by the city's Landmark Law, which turns 50 on Sunday. Above, the beautiful Pennsylvania Station before its 1963 destruction . The loss of the old Penn Station, which was replaced by Madison Square Garden, helped lead to the establishment of a commission that can designate historic places as landmarks and prevent them being demolished . The metal pillars of the old Pennsylvania station stand before bulldozers during its demolition. A new exhibition looks at the lead up to the preservation measures . The ornate sculptures and elaborately designed fixtures of the former Pennsylvania station lie in a heap of rubble to make way for a basketball arena and concert venue . St John's Chapel, which was built in the area now called Soho in 1807, was demolished in 1918 as the city moved to widen the street next to it . The law was signed by Mayor Robert Wagner on April 19, 1965, and upheld by the Supreme Court in 1978 following a campaign led by Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis to save another iconic railroad station \u2014 Grand Central. The Landmarks Preservation Commission was given a mandate to preserve buildings and places of cultural, architectural and historical significance. Owners of properties given the designation must get permits from the commission before making restorations, alterations or additions, though some still say that the agency does not have the funds it needs to look at and preserve all worthy sites as the city builds to ease an affordable housing crisis. The Randall Memorial Church (left) in Snug Harbor, Staten Island, fell into disrepair and was demolished by 1952. The Snug Harbor Music Hall (right) and other buildings in area built in the 1890s have been preserved by the city and still stand today . The City Hall Post Office, designed by A B Mullet on City Hall Park, was widely criticized as 'Mullet's monstrosity' after it opened in 1880 and was torn down in the late 1930s . The Ziegfield Theatre, one of early 20th century New York's movie palaces after it was built in 1927 (left), was torn down in 1966 to make way for an office building. The theatre later reopened nearby and still hosts film premiers, but lacks its former distinctive architecture . The TWA Flight Center (pictured in 1978) at John F Kennedy Airport is on the list of historic and culturally significant sites protected by New York City's Landmarks Law. Both its exterior and interior, designed by\u00a0Eero Saarinen in the 1960s, are preserved . The Pieter Claesen Wyckoff House, which was built in 1652 and is the oldest building in New York state, was designated a historic landmark in 1968, preventing its demolition for street improvements . In its first five years, it designated 300 to 400 buildings, over a dozen historic districts and reviewed 800 applications. Today the commission's work is increasingly bigger. Over the last five years alone, it reviewed nearly 67,000 applications. Famous buildings given such designation include Radio City Music Hall, St. Bartholomew's Church, Federal Hall, Brooklyn Botanic Garden, the New York Stock Exchange, Coney Island's Parachute Jump, and the Alice Austen House on Staten Island. Historic districts such as those in Greenwich Village and Brooklyn Heights make up the majority of the 33,000 properties with landmark status. The NYC Landmarks50 Alliance said there are 1,400 individual landmarks in the five boroughs in addition to interior landmarks and ten scenic landmarks at popular parks. The exhibition traces the trajectory of the preservation movement in New York City, from the end of the 19th century up to the present day. Carnegie Hall in Midtown was opened in 1891 after being financed by 19th century industrialist Andrew Carnegie. It still regularly holds concerts in the present day (right, in 2007) New York City's Landmarks Law has protected a large number of buildings in central and southern Manhattan, though it is also used to protect 19th century homes in Washington Heights (pictured) and historic places in the outer boroughs . The Unisphere in Flushing Meadows Park, Queens, was built for the 1964-1965 World's Fair by the US Steel Corporation as a symbol of world peace. It is protected by the  Landmarks Law . Documents, photos, models and drawings also are used to chronicle the landmarks' development and the losses of important structures in the 1950s and 1960s. Fragments from the destroyed Penn Station and other buildings also are on display. 'The goal of the exhibition is to show the preservation movement in a contemporary slant and its relevance today,' said Donald Albrecht, the museum's curator. Landmarking has never been about freezing the city or making the city into a museum, said Andrew Dolkart, exhibition co-curator and director of the historic preservation program at Columbia University. Rather, as the exhibition shows, preservation allows for both lively new architecture and saving the past for future generations. New York's Grand Central Terminal and its Main Waiting Room was at one point slated to be destroyed to make way for an office building before a campaign by former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis . The statue of George Washington on the steps of Federal Hall faces the facade of the New York Stock Exchange. Both buildings are  protected by the city's Landmarks Law . The Coney Island parachute jump (left, in 1952) is protected by the Landmarks law and now towers over the Brooklyn Cyclones' baseball stadium on the southern coast of Brooklyn (right, 2011).

        "article": "If the team with momentum hold an ace card heading into the play-offs, then watch out for Wolves. Kenny Jackett\u2019s team moved into sixth place in the Championship with a fourth successive victory after David Edwards, the substitute, headed home two minutes from the end of an unpredictable and thrilling game. Pre-match results had offered Wolves a prospective route into the play-off zone, with Brentford and Ipswich Town dropping points unexpectedly, and Kenny Jackett reflected the burgeoning confidence within Molineux by naming an unchanged starting line-up from the side that prevailed 2-1 at Nottingham Forest on Friday for a third successive victory. Wolves substitute David Edwards races away in celebration after scoring a late winner . Edwards is congratulated by his Wolves team-mates following his 88th-minute winner against Leeds . Wolves striker Benik Afobe slides on his knees after scoring his side's third goal of the afternoon . WOLVES (4-4-2): Ikeme; Iorfa, Batth, Stearman, Golbourne; Henry (Van la Parra 78mins), McDonald, Price, Sako; Afobe, Dicko (Edwards 70) Subs not used: Kuszczak, Doherty, Doyle, Ebanks-Landell, Hause .

Booked: Wooton, Byram, Bamba . Goal: Taylor 11, Batth OG 65, Mowatt 74 . Referee: David Coote . Attendance: 25,169 . With a day less to recover, Leeds had also been on a decent run before Saturday\u2019s 3-0 home defeat by Blackburn Rovers topped another distressing chapter in their tumultuous recent history. Neil Redfearn, the head coach, had said he would consider his future after this game at Wolves after his assistant Steve Thompson had been suspended without explanation. Although Massimon Cellini, Leeds\u2019 banned owner, has subsequently claimed Thomson had used abusive language towards sporting director Nicola Salerno, it was only another spanner in the works for this once-proud club who need stability more than anything. Still, it was Leeds who struck the first blow, courtesy of a poor defensive clearance from Kevin McDonald who, penned back towards his own corner flag by debutant Kalvin Phillips, attempted a loose clearance that cannoned off Richard Stearman, his own team-mate, for Charlie Taylor to sidefoot under Carl Ikeme. Even before the January arrival of Benik Afobe, now level with Harry Kane as the leading goalscorer in all four divisions, Wolves have happily relied on either and both of the Mali combination of Bakary Sako and Nouha Dicko. It was the latter who earned Jackett\u2019s team the lead by half-time. Dicko equalised from the tightest of angles when a cross-shot from Afobe, all loping legs and dizzying stepovers, eluded Marco Silvestri. It still needed a cute finish as the former Wigan striker lifted his shot over Scott Wootton from the byline for his 12th goal of an increasingly impressive season. Alex Mowatt looks delighted after putting Leeds back on level terms by scoring his side's third goal . Wolves goalkeeper Carl Ikeme  dives in vain as Mowatt makes it 3-3 before Edwards' late winner . Leeds attempted to disrupt Wolves\u2019 rhythm with some fiercely competitive tackling, Phillips receiving one caution for fouling McDonald then fortunate not to be dismissed for a foul that ripped holes in the former Sheffield United midfielder\u2019s sock. The home side started to put together the pieces of their flowing passing game as half-time approached however and, in stoppage time, Leeds conceded at what appeared to be the worst time. Their defence appeared to disappear as Sako played in Dicko who took his time before firing in off the near post. Wolves turned the screw at the start of the second half as Afobe joined in the goalscoring fun three minutes after the restart. The former Arsenal striker, who scored 19 times on loan for MK Dons in the first half of the season, attempted an audacious overhead kick from Jack Price\u2019s cross into the area. Sako kept play alive, dropping the ball back for Batth, whose shot hit Dicko but fell back for Afobe to smash in his tenth goal for Wolves. Leeds looked as if they might capitulate at this stage before Wolves offered them a lifeline back into the game in the 66th minute. Alex Mowatt\u2019s dink into the penalty area looked pretty harmless and a cry of \u2018leave it\u2019 could be heard from the press box, presumably from Ikeme, only for Batth to lunge and divert the ball past his own goalkeeper. Richard Stearman was the next guilty party in the Wolves defence as he gave the ball away cheaply to Mowatt who cut inside and from outside the penalty area curled home a superb equaliser into the top corner. Wolves do possess strength in depth however and in David Edwards they have a midfielder who not only works as hard as anyone in pressing the ball but also chips in with crucial goals. So it was that the substitute rose two minutes from time to head McDonald\u2019s telling cross into the top corner to wrap up the win that took Wolves into sixth place.

Afobe popped up unmarked early on to bundle home and the result leaves Wigan on the verge of dropping into English football\u2019s third-tier after a dreadful season. To make matters worse, the Latics will have to face Brentford next weekend without star man James McClean who received his marching orders in injury-time for a second bookable offence. Wolverhampton's Benik Afobe (right) celebrates scoring the winner in a 1-0 defeat of Wigan . The Latics had James McClean sent off for a second bookable offence in jury time .

Booked: Iorfa, Stearman and Dicko . Scorer: Afobe 25 . Referee: J Linington . Attendance: 16,810 . The Latics now have to hope Rotherham fail against Reading on Tuesday and Leeds United next weekend while they win at Griffin Park on the last day of the season. Wigan\u2019s dire position represents a spectacular downfall for the north-west club who lifted the FA Cup just 712 days ago and who spent eight entertaining years in the Premier League between 2005 and 2013. They once seemed to brilliantly punch above their weight in England\u2019s top-flight but they have slipped into despair after using three managers and 42 players across this season. And, worryingly enough for their fans, if they do go down an uncomfortable summer involving an expected player exodus will almost certainly be on the cards. Yet this clash was not all about the home side as Afobe also ensured that Wolves fans can still dream of a Wembley ending to this season \u2013 but only just. The stakes for both sides in this clash could hardly have been higher as Kenny Jackett\u2019s visitors needed three points to keep up their late scramble for a play-off spot although that now looks unlikely as they would need three points and a huge goal swing on the last day to make it into the top six. Afobe races past\u00a0Wigan's Gaetan Bong as the visitors kept their hopes of promotion alive . Wigan defender Emmerson Boyce drops to his knees as the former FA Cup winners head towards the drop . Gary Caldwell, the former Wigan captain parachuted into the managerial hotseat following Malky Mackay\u2019s sacking earlier this month, again called for the club\u2019s fans to meet and greet his squad at the players\u2019 carpark before the match to let them know how much survival meant. A healthy handful did just that but their pleas fell on deaf ears in a clash that just about summed up Wigan\u2019s entire season. They home side dominated the opening moments and looked up for the challenge of beating the odds \u2013 and the drop \u2013 and McClean should have scored when he swivelled and shot from close range after seven minutes. Caldwell\u2019s influence on Wigan has been immediate and they are playing far better football than witnessed earlier this year under either Uwe Rosler or Mackay. But killer instinct is in short supply \u2013 and it showed. Former Stoke star Jermaine Pennant was the next to test Wolves defence as his deflected effort only just went over the bar after 12 minutes but the home side were then undone shortly after with the kind of goal that underlines the chronic defensive frailties that have so affected this term. A Bakary Sako free-kick from the edge of the box was brilliantly met by Afobe who could not miss from three yards out as Wigan\u2019s defence stood and watched. As news filtered around the DW Stadium that Derby were losing at Millwall, and that Wolves were just a point outside the top-six as a consequence, Jackett\u2019s side looked to press home their advantage against a Wigan side that played attractively without any real penetration. However, neither side created any real clear-cut chances and both goalkeepers spent the remainder of the first half as spectators. After the break, Wigan again began fresher as they knew they had 45 minutes to realistically save their season and although McClean, Pennant and Bo-kyung tried to link up and break down Wolves, they again lacked any real cutting edge. Wigan's James Perch and Wigan's Marc-Antoine Fortune head off dejected after the final whistle . Wigan supporters begin to come to terms with the fact that relegation is out of their hands . However, it was the same at both ends with Nouha Dicko and Sako both having little say in the game and although Afobe did find the back of the net after 57 minutes, his handball in the build-up was spotted by the referee who disallowed the effort. With half an hour to go, Wolves should have been 2-0 up but Wigan had keeper Carson to thank for blocking Dicko as he ran through on goal. And Carson was also at his best soon after when Afobe\u2019s corner was superbly flicked goalwards by Dave Edwards but the former England No.1 brilliantly tipped over to keep the Latics in the contest. His team-mates responded to his efforts by launching a late charge at Wolves with James Perch and McClean both looking to surge forward and get on the scoresheet. Both sets of players observe a minute's silence to mark the anniversary of the Bradford stadium fire . Last week, when Wigan threw caution to the wind against Brighton they were rewarded with a late three points and they tried the same again in this match but they could not quite manage it. And when McClean picked up a second yellow in the dying moments , Wigan\u2019s hopes left the field with him. Both these teams can still get what they want out of this season. But only just. And next Saturday will have to be really, truly remarkable if that is to happen.",

        "article": "Skipper John O'Shea has challenged Sunderland to keep their fate in their own hands by securing a fifth successive derby victory over Newcastle. The Wear-Tyne rivals meet at the Stadium of Light on Sunday with Sunderland having won the last four meetings, but in grave need of three points to ease themselves away from the developing battle for Barclays Premier League survival. O'Shea and his team-mates could find themselves inside the relegation zone by the time they run out if Burnley get the better of Tottenham in the day's earlier kick-off, and that would make three points a necessity. John O'Shea, pictured playing for Ireland at the weekend, wants a fifth straight derby win against Newcastle . The Black Cats captain celebrates scoring against Newcastle in the Tyne-Wear derby of 2012 . The Republic of Ireland international told SAFSee: 'That's the big issue: whoever we were facing this weekend, be in Newcastle, be it Crystal Palace, be it Southampton, whoever the case may be, it's a case of getting the three points as soon as we can and getting everyone energised again and looking forward to the remaining games. 'Look, we know we're not in the position that we'd like to be in, but we know we can get out of it. It's in our hands.' After a dreadful run of results against their arch-rivals, the Black Cats have fared rather well in recent times, winning the last three at St James' Park and the most recent game on Wearside. Asked what lay behind that run of results, O'Shea said: 'Staying together as a unit, keeping the team spirit strong, working as a unit all over the pitch and taking chances. 'Making sure we got clean sheets and also whether it was early or late in the game, making sure we took chances - they were the keys, and obviously having a strong squad as well because there were a couple of times where there were changes in the line-up before games. Jermain Defoe rues a missed opportunity during defeat to West Ham in Sunderland's previous game . 'Everyone has got to be mentally prepared to start the game, and obviously anything can happen then in the 90 minutes. 'Look, it's one of those things, we have a chance of creating a fantastic record against a big rival, the main rival for us, so it's a fantastic opportunity. 'But ultimately, it comes down to wanting it more on the day and hopefully, that will be the case.'",

        "article": "(CNN)Tuesday, April 14, is Equal Pay Day. Here's the announcement presidential candidate Hillary Clinton should make: . \"Today in America, women earn on average 77 cents for every dollar men earn.  And the gap is even greater for women of color. That's unconscionable.  As president, my top priority will be fixing inequality and ensuring that 100% of the population is paid 100% of what they're worth.  And so, I'm announcing that if elected president, I will take a 23% pay cut, equivalent to the current gender wage gap, to stand in solidarity with working women in America. And I won't take a raise until every woman in America gets a raise, too.\" April 14 wasn't just chosen at random as Equal Pay Day. It's based on a calculation: For women to make the same amount of money that men made in 2014, they'd have to work until April 14, 2015. A woman on average loses $431,000 in pay over the course of a 40-year career. Merely closing the gender wage gap would pull half of working single moms out of poverty.  And at a time where Republicans are still, bizarrely, trumpeting more tax breaks for business and the rich to stimulate the economy, closing the pay gap would put money in the pockets of working people who would actually spend and stimulate real growth. The new women warriors: Reviving the fight for equal rights . So here's the perfect opportunity for Hillary Clinton to put her money where her mouth is, literally. In her campaign launch and personal rebrand, Clinton is clearly trying to portray herself as a woman of the people, a populist fighter for the middle class. \"Everyday Americans need a champion,\" Clinton said in her campaign launch video, \"and I want to be that champion.\" Clinton has deftly put her finger in the wind and sensed the winds of populism blowing through America. Indeed, the fact that many Democratic voters still clamor for a less pro-war, less pro-Wall Street, more Elizabeth Warren-like alternative to Clinton is an ever-present thorn in the otherwise blooming garden of Clinton's inevitability. Opinion: The myth of Equal Pay Day . With her video, Clinton has signaled a clear desire to ground herself and her candidacy in the soil of populism. But can a wealthy white woman who once sat on the board of Walmart, has already lived in the White House, collects six-figure speaking fees and doesn't seem to own a pair of jeans really inhabit the portrait of a populist fighter? This is where a good ol'-fashioned political stunt would come in handy.  And make no mistake about it, I'm recommending a political stunt. Let's call a spade a spade. Hillary Clinton is a very rich person. While she's certainly not the first rich person to run for president, her wealth -- and the related perception of being out of touch with ordinary Americans -- is an obstacle in her candidacy. The difference between the current standard presidential salary of $400,000 a year and the 77 cents-on-the-dollar version of that salary, or $308,000, is probably a drop in the bucket in Clinton's bank account at this point. And yet the symbolic power is profound. Because what Clinton would be reminding us is that across America, the aggregate salaries of all working women is 23% less than the aggregate salaries of all men. 78 cents on the dollar: The facts about the gender wage gap . Thanks to the hacked Sony emails, we saw that even top female stars and executives in Hollywood are paid less than their male counterparts. What more powerful message could the potential first female president send than literally signifying that nationwide inequity in her own salary? Clinton wouldn't just be saying she stands with the working women of America, she'd be showing it. Is it offensive to suggest that the first female commander in chief should be paid 23% less than her male predecessors for doing exactly the same work?  Yes. And that's the point -- to use her status to highlight the offensive gender wage gap and what Clinton, as president, would do to fix it. Yes, such stunts are trite and theatrical.  They're also effective, especially in our increasingly short-attention-span, it-only-happened-if-you-can-tweet it, symbolism-over-substance culture. Politics used to be about clunky people (mostly men) debating complex policies. Now it's about polished memes and even more polished candidates. Policy (I hope) still matters, but we're as likely to debate a candidate's \"image\" as her or his \"substance.\" The truth is that stunts and theatrics are now part and parcel of politics, as they are in our culture in general. That doesn't mean they can't also serve a noble purpose, in highlighting important problems and inspiring solutions. Map: Where the gender pay gap is the widest . Clinton did an arguably brilliant thing in her campaign launch, framing her video and presidential bid as not about her but the American people. In fact, Clinton didn't even appear in the video until the very end -- it was all about middle-class Americans, working hard, trying to get by and get ahead. And then we see Hillary, who wants to help. Hillary Clinton can't change who she is, the baggage attached to her by both the right and the left, rightly or wrongly. But she can change what she does going forward, how she shows up and signifies herself as a voice not for the status quo and the establishment -- but for ordinary Americans who need change. If Clinton wins, her presidency will indeed be symbolic and historic. And it will be significant if she does something to change the lives of the 158 million women in America.",

        "article": "Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff sees no reason to go cap in hand to the powers that be within the German giant and demand extra revenue to fight off the new threat of Ferrari. From out of the blue, it was the scarlet red of Ferrari that was back on the top step of the podium for the first time in almost two years last time out in Malaysia, pushing reigning champion Lewis Hamilton and team-mate Nico Rosberg down to second and third. From the threat of another Silver Arrows-dominated campaign in the wake of last year's stunning success and crushing start to the season in Australia, Formula One was provided with a much-needed tonic with Ferrari's return to winning ways courtesy of Sebastian Vettel. Sebastian Vettel saw off the challenge from Mercedes drivers Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg in Malaysia . Vettel (right) won the second race of the season following Mercedes' dominance last year . That led to speculation Wolff was prepared to ask for more funds from the Mercedes board to ensure his team stayed ahead of the pack. But a dismissive Wolff said: 'We have everything we need. 'We feel confident in the resources we have, the staff we have, and that we are well-placed. 'We just need to stay calm, continue to develop and put the right things on the car. 'Maybe we put some things earlier on the car than planned, but there is no reason to panic. 'We are back into a regular racing season where you have more than just one contender, and more than one-twos every single weekend. It's back to normal business.' Mercedes chief Toto Wolff claims the champions will just keep calm and carry on . Mercedes will look into reasons why the team was beaten into second and third in Malaysia . Wolff insists his team has left no stone unturned since the race in Malaysia in a bid to uncover what went wrong, even though most teams would jump through hoops for a two-three finish. 'Although we had two cars on the podium, we have been looking very carefully at every area where we could have performed better,' said Wolff. 'Our opposition has raised its game and we must now raise ours even further. 'As we have said since Melbourne, we expect a season-long battle for both world championships and we must maximise every opportunity. Rosberg (left) and Hamilton visited Mercedes' Brackley base to go through their cars on Thursday . 'China is the next chance to do that - a circuit which has been a good hunting ground for the team. 'Lewis has a great record here, and for Nico it's where he made his first step into the winners' circle. 'We have the weapons at our disposal and we need to make the most of them this weekend.' Hamilton is a three-time winner at the Shanghai International Circuit - including last year - whilst he has been on the podium on three other occasions. Rosberg, meanwhile, was second to Hamilton last year after triumphing in 2012. Like Wolff, Hamilton knows more can and will be done, as he said: 'Malaysia was a tough weekend. Hamilton heads to Shanghai having won the Chinese Grand Prix last year on his way to the title . 'It always is with the heat, but with car problems on Friday, rain during qualifying on Saturday and a race which didn't go to plan on Sunday, that one was particularly challenging. 'Ultimately we made the best choices we could, but there is always room for improvement and we've been working hard to analyse everything for the next race in China. 'The circuit is one I really enjoy and it suits my driving style quite well. 'I won the race last year and have only finished outside of the podium places twice, so the target is definitely to build on that and get back to the front.' The British driver is congratulated by film star Arnold Schwarzenegger after winning the Australian Grand Prix . From his perspective, Rosberg is far from happy with his two races to date which have seen him finish second and third. 'It's not been a perfect start to my sixth year with the team and I'm determined to turn that around this weekend,' insisted Rosberg. 'Of course, my team-mate will have other ideas, so will my compatriot in the red car (Vettel) I'm sure. 'But this is a track that has always suited me well, so I'm aiming to put in a strong weekend.'",

        "article": "A farmer has lost a nine-year legal battle to save the dream home he built without planning permission and hid behind hay bales for four years. Robert Fidler, 66, secretly constructed the mock-Tudor castle complete with battlements and cannons and lived there with his family from 2002. He unveiled it officially in 2006 when he thought he would be able to exploit a legal loophole that prevents enforcement action against a structure if no objections have been made for at least four years. Scroll down for video . Robert Fidler has lost a nine-year legal battle to save the dream home (above) he built in Salfords, Surrey, without planning permission and hid behind hay bales for four years . But the local authority immediately laid siege by refusing to grant retrospective permission. Now, after numerous court appearances costing tens of thousands of pounds, Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles has finally ruled the four-bedroom home on Green Belt land at Honeycrocks Farm in Salfords, Surrey \u2013 worth well in excess of \u00a31million if sold on the open market - must be pulled down within 90 days. Mr Fidler yesterday compared the situation to an artist being made to destroy a piece of work. \u2018It would be like Rembrandt being asked to rip up his masterpiece of an oil painting or something for me to demolish it,\u2019 he complained. He added: \u2018I don\u2019t think I have any choice, to be honest. What they\u2019re saying now is if I don\u2019t demolish it in 90 days they\u2019ll put me in prison.\u2019 Mr Fidler started as a tenant farmer at Honeycrock Farm in the 1970s and bought the farmyard and ten acres of land in 1985. There was no farmhouse, however, so from 2000 he began building the house around two grain silos at a cost of \u00a350,000. Features include weathered brick and stone, carved wooden pillars and beams and a stained-glass dome above the stairwell. The 66-year-old used dozens of hay bales, blue tarpaulin and tyres to hide the house (above) from 2002 to 2006 . Mr Fidler, pictured (above) outside the house, compared the situation to an artist being made to destroy a piece of work . Mr Fidler and his wife, Linda, went to such lengths to hoodwink locals and the authorities that they kept their son Harry, now 14, off playschool on the day his class were due to paint scenes of their homes. \u2018We couldn\u2019t have him drawing a big blue haystack \u2013 people might have asked questions,\u2019 Mrs Fidler explained previously. Neighbours expressed anger at the brazenness of the plan when the property\u2019s existence was declared. One said: \u2018It was a complete shock when the hay came down and this castle was in its place. Everyone else has to abide by planning laws, so why shouldn\u2019t they?\u2019 Reigate and Banstead Borough Council served an enforcement notice requiring it be razed to the ground, claiming the four-year period after which the building would be allowed to stay was void as no one had been able to see it. Mr Fidler, who has five children from a previous marriage, appealed to the Planning Inspectorate which found in favour of the council because the property had not been \u2018substantially complete\u2019 for the four years required. Mr Fidler and his wife, Linda (above), went to such lengths to hoodwink locals and the authorities that they kept their son Harry, now 14, off playschool on the day his class were due to paint scenes of their homes . The four-bedroom house, complete with chandeliers, would be worth well in excess of \u00a31million if sold on the open market - but it must be pulled down within 90 days . Features include weathered brick and stone, carved wooden pillars and beams, and a stained-glass dome above the stairwell . This was a reference to the bales and tarpaulins that had been used to conceal it, meaning the project had effectively continued after 2002. The farmer then took his case to the High Court in 2009 and to the Court of Appeal the following year, both of which dismissed his challenge. Further delays were caused when he submitted applications for the house to be retained for agricultural use. He claimed it was needed to provide accommodation for a worker in connection with a beef farming business on the site. These were rejected by the Planning Inspectorate last year but another appeal was heard in a Public Inquiry before Eric Pickles, the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, intervened and dismissed the claim, which raised \u2018important or novel issues of development control and/or legal difficulties.\u2019 A council spokesman yesterday said it had a \u2018duty\u2019 to uphold planning rules designed to protect the Green Belt. He added: \u2018The Secretary of State\u2019s decision demonstrates that people who ignore planning rules for the good of everyone are likely to find themselves in this unfortunate position.\u2019",

Rowdy: Charwoman Susannah Booton was arrested for drunken behaviour in February 1906 . Criminal:\u00a0Each notice bore a mugshot of the criminal, as well as a description of their nose and face; Annie Hodgkins was said to have a 'fresh complexion' despite being sentenced to three weeks' hard labour . Poster: Unemployed Kate Kibble, another woman convicted of being drunk and disorderly, was described as having a 'broad' build, as well as losing her right eye and having 'both little fingers crooked' Some of the bizarre offences committed by past Birmingham residents include theft of a dead duck and riding a horse while drunk. Nearly 10,000 Edwardian felons are listed in the UK Midlands criminal registers providing fascinating insight into the murky underworld of Birmingham's metropolis more than a century ago. Among those on the blacklist are Henry Bonus, 40, who was sentenced to a year's hard labour and three months' police supervision after stealing eight pounds of ham. Elsewhere, 18-year-old William Handley was sentenced to eight months' hard labour and one-year's police supervision for stealing a 'dead duck' and a teapot. Careers: Sarah Henson combined her job as a dressmaker with an extra source of income as a prostitute, before being banned from pubs for being drunk and disorderly . Haggard: Just 38, Eliza Fallon looked a lot older than her years when she was arrested for drunkenness . Distinctive: Sarah Evans, left, and Ellen Heaton, right, could be recognised by their scars, according to the Birmingham archives . Records reveal how offenders came from a variety of backgrounds, such as metal cutters, grease merchants, labourers and hawkers. Many had aliases - suggesting criminal careers - while others had scars or physical handicaps, ranging from Kate Kibble's one eye to cut marks on faces, broken noses and missing fingers. Some, however, lived perfectly respectable lives - until they walked through the door of their local watering hole. It shows how those living in Edwardian England were just as likely to get half-cut and troublesome on a night out as boozy Brits in today's binge drinking culture.",

        "article": "Prison officials must treat an inmate's gender identity condition just as they would treat any other medical or mental health condition, the Justice Department said in a court filing Friday. The Southern Poverty Law Center in February filed a lawsuit against Georgia Department of Corrections officials on behalf of Ashley Diamond, a transgender woman. The lawsuit says prison officials have failed to provide adequate treatment for Diamond's gender dysphoria, a condition that causes a person to experience extreme distress because of a disconnect between the birth sex and gender identity. Prison officials must treat an inmate's gender identity condition just as they would treat any other medical or mental health condition, according to a Justice Department ruling in the case of transgender inmate Ashley Diamond . A photo of Diamond compared to her Department of Corrections mugshot shows the drastic difference without maintaining treatment . The Justice Department filed a brief in the case Friday saying it's not taking a position on the accuracy of Diamond's claims, but reminding prison officials that the Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution requires them to provide inmates with individualized assessment and care for the condition. Department of Corrections spokeswoman Gwendolyn Hogan wrote in an email that the agency doesn't comment on pending litigation. While similar cases have been brought in other courts, Justice Department officials said this is the first time the agency has gotten involved in one of these cases. That action signals this administration's commitment to protecting the interests of transgender people in this context and sends a message to state officials that the federal government has taken a clear position on the substantive legal issues in the case, said Georgia State University law professor Russell Covey. 'If Georgia disagrees, that sort of holds out the possibility of some future legal conflict between the state and the federal government,' he said. 'It's a kind of shot across the bow.' Diamond, who's 36, has identified as female since she was a child and began hormone therapy when she was 17, the lawsuit says. Diamond says she has been subject to ridicule and even sexual assault while behind bars . That gave her full breasts, a feminine shape, softer skin and a feminine appearance. Only inmates identified as transgender during their initial intake screenings are eligible for gender dysphoria treatment under Georgia Department of Corrections policy, but the personnel who do those screenings often aren't familiar with the condition, the lawsuit says. Despite having noticeable feminine physical characteristics and telling department staff she was transgender and receiving hormone therapy, Diamond was not evaluated for gender dysphoria and wasn't referred for treatment and her hormone therapy was halted, the lawsuit says. Though medical personnel subsequently evaluated her and determined she had gender dysphoria and that hormone therapy and female gender expression were medically necessary, department officials refused to authorize the treatment, the lawsuit says. So-called freeze-frame policies, that only allow inmates the level of treatment that they received before imprisonment and that allow no treatment for those who weren't initially classified as suffering from gender dysphoria are unconstitutional, the Justice Department brief says. Such policies violate the Eighth Amendment prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment. Without the hormone treatment for the past three years, Diamond's body has suffered a painful physical transformation back to its masculine state and she has experienced severe mental anguish, the lawsuit says. She has also been subject to ridicule by inmates and prison staff and has been sexually assaulted by inmates because she hasn't been offered safe accommodation, the lawsuit says. Diamond, 36, identifies as a female and has been on hormone therapy since she was 17 . Southern Poverty Law Center staff attorney Chinyere Ezie said in an emailed statement Friday that the Justice Department brief bolsters their arguments. 'Transgender inmates like Ashley have a right to proper medical care,' Ezie said. 'They have a right to protection from violence and abuse and these rights are secured by the U.S. Constitution.' Other courts have ordered hormones, psychotherapy and other treatments for transgender inmates. A federal judge on Thursday ordered California's corrections department to provide a transgender inmate with sex-reassignment surgery, the first time such an operation has been ordered in the state. It was only the second time anywhere in the country that a judge issued an injunction directing a state prison system to provide the surgery, said Ilona Turner, legal director at the Transgender Law Center in Oakland. The previous order in a Massachusetts case was overturned last year and is being appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.",

Amy-Beth Ellice, 17, from Essex started baking at the age of three and landed her first book deal with her recipe collection Amy's Baking Year at just 14. Her second, all about entertaining, is now firmly in the works but the teenager has her sights set even higher - with plans to launch her own baking products and even become a TV chef. Already baking at five years old Amy-Beth (left) is pictured with sister\u00a0Lara-Jayne, 10 . Amy-Beth started baking at three-years-old and published her first cookbook, Amy's Baking Year, at age 13 . Amy-Beth most recently hosted a cupcake-making class in Harrods, London. Britain's youngest published baker, who counts Pixie Lott and Katherine Jenkins among her fans, delighted a crowd with her recent demonstration. She then signed copies of her debut cookbook in the Toy Kingdom department for thrilled shoppers. Amy-Beth also has a regular column in OK! magazine and continues to supply other publications with tips and recipes. The keen cook, who attends Newhall School in Chelmsford full-time, makes bespoke baked goods to order in her spare time, during summer holidays and half term. But it seems the talented young baker gets it all from her mother Gillian, who taught Amy and her other daughter Lara-Jayne, 22, how to make cakes. Amy gets decorating as she shows onlookers how to perfect cupcakes at a London presentation . The young cook pictured with fans at her Harrods book signing and cupcake masterclass . Amy picked up a particular knack for baking and continued to experiment until she soon took full control of the kitchen and the entertaining. Gillian told MailOline: 'When she was little Amy showed an interest and passion, as I did when I was a child, in cooking and baking. 'She watched me cook all meals and bake birthday cakes for many members of our family from scratch. 'I always preferred to make my own cakes as I knew exactly what was going in them, they tasted nicer and they were (and still are) much appreciated. 'Amy soon wanted to venture out on her own and at aged 12 she asked if she could bake her sister Lara-Jayne's cake for her 17th birthday. 'I had planned a simple chocolate sponge cake but Amy, being more adventurous, single-handedly created a two-tiered cake covered in roll-out fondant icing. 'She then decorated it with heart shaped biscuits on sticks, which later became a recipe in her book (lollipop biscuits). 'She has quite literally surpassed me in the kitchen, a fact that I'm both proud and amazed at. 'It is sometimes hard to get into the kitchen now as Amy is often experimenting with recipes, baking for charity cake sales, or helping preparing for a party or event we are organising.' Her inventive bakes are remarkable for her age. Amy designed and made a pony-themed cake for a teacher at age 12. At age 14 she was commissioned by another teacher to make a three-tiered lace effect wedding cake. She finally baked it in chocolate at age 16 using carrot, pineapple and lemon flavours. A mini oven at Christmas could certainly have helped ignite Amy's passion for cake making . When she was little Amy showed an interest and passion in cooking and baking . Amy launched a cupcake and cake business at age 13 with the help of her mother, as they both thought they could make better cakes than what was already out there. The teenager said: 'I made cupcakes for regular clients as well as celebrity functions and after parties and it grew from there. 'After having seven of my recipes published in a national newspaper weekend supplements, I approached a few publishers with a mock-up of the ideas I had for my book and got the book deal at age 14.' Her book, Amy's Baking Year, features recipes themed around the four seasons and occasions such as\u00a0for Mother's Day, Easter, Halloween and Christmas. Amy launched a cupcake and cake business at age 13 with the help of her mother Gillian, as they both thought they could make better cakes than what was already out there .

With a focus on family, the recipes are designed for both seasoned bakers and young enthusiasts. Amy's Baking Year features Amy's selected easy-to-follow recipes themed around the four seasons . The beautifully illustrated book also features tips on the perfect decoration and setting for each bake. She says: 'I have been brought up cooking and baking by my mum who is also a talented home cook and baker, as were her parents who both worked in catering.' A few of the recipes in the book such as my Grandad's Coconut Ice, and Aunty Lynn's Fudge have been passed down to Amy from members of her family. She continues:\u00a0'While I was at home experimenting with recipes my friends were spending their time on social media. 'It was something that I was passionate about so really enjoyed spending my time focusing on it. 'I think it's important that we return to traditional values and that what I try to get across through my cooking. 'The art of cooking and eating healthily is important to me, so I'm very conscious of the ingredients I cook with, but I think we're becoming too calorie obsessed. That being said I try not to eat everything I bake.' She is juggling her lucrative cooking career around studying for her A-levels in English literature, art and music. 'The school I attend doesn't offer cookery as an A Level. I hope to go on to train at Le Cordon Bleu in the future after I have finished school.' Amy says she hopes to have her next cookbook themed around entertaining on bookshelves nationwide by 2017.",

New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady also threw a first pitch, at Fenway Park in Boston - but didn't do himself proud, chucking the ball straight at the ground.

Taya Kyle gets a hug from San Diego Padres starting pitcher Andrew Cashner after throwing out the first ceremonial pitch . De Blasio's relations with the police unions and some rank-and-file officers were fractured in the aftermath of the December shooting that claimed the lives of Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu. They were murdered on patrol in Brooklyn on December 20 by a crazed gunman who then committed suicide. Since that crisis, which threatened to overwhelm the mayor's agenda, de Blasio has taken pains to repair relations with the nation's largest police force, brokering a new union contract, investing in new technology and training, and doubling down on his public praise of the department. On Monday, he joined the tens of thousands of fans in cheering as the officers' images were displayed on the park's giant video screens and again when Ramos' two sons and Liu's widow threw out the pitches to Mets players David Wright, Matt Harvey and Curtis Granderson. De Blasio, however, was largely booed when he was introduced to the crowd. A year ago, de Blasio was also booed as he threw out the first pitch (a strike). Both years, he sported a Mets cap and jersey, which was emblazoned with his last name and the number 6, a tribute to Rico Petrocelli, a longtime shortstop on de Blasio's favorite team, the Boston Red Sox. Petrocelli, like de Blasio, was also of Italian descent and lived in Brooklyn. The tribute to the NYPD comes as de Blasio is weighing a City Council proposal to hire 1,000 more police officers. The idea has been endorsed by union leaders who said it would reduce pressure on existing officers to keep crime low. But de Blasio rejected an identical council proposal a year ago, pointing to the city's record low crime and suggesting that the money would be better spent elsewhere.

Members of the Liu and Ramos families, including Yenjian Liu's widow, Pei Xia Chen, second from left, throw out the ceremonial first pitch . Police Commissioner William Bratton has, at times, signaled support for the effort to hire more officers for the department, which now has a headcount of about 34,500, about 6,000 fewer than at its peak in 2001. De Blasio has not committed to hiring more officers but has been more receptive to the proposal in his public remarks than he was a year ago. The council's budget office projected that hiring two new classes of officers, to total 1,000, would cost nearly $69m in the upcoming fiscal year. But the council believes that the cost will be offset by the corresponding reduction in overtime.

        "article": "Accused: Officer Aaron Stringer, from Bakersfield, California, allegedly pulled on the toes and 'tickled' the feet of a man whom police had recently killed . A police officer who allegedly 'loves playing with dead bodies' has been accused of 'tickling' the feet and yanking on the head and toes of a dead man who had been recently shot killed by cops. Aaron Stringer, of the Bakersfield, California, Police Department, reportedly said 'tickle tickle' as he ran his fingers along the soles of the feet of Ramiro James Villegas, a 22-year-old whom officers killed the same day. A trainee police officer who was with him at the time told how Stringer then pulled on the corpse's toes, and pulled his head back and forth while discussing rigor mortis after the shooting on November 13. According to the Bakersfield Californian, he then said that he 'loves playing with dead bodies' and later told her to lie about what she'd seen. Stringer has been on paid administrative leave from the department since it started investigating the chilling accusations in November. Villegas was shot dead by police after crashing his car in a high-speed chase, ABC23 reported. Officers say they gunned him down after he got out of the car and reached for his waistband, raising fears that he had a gun. It later became clear that he wasn't armed. Stringer, who filed a police report about the day's activities, mentioned interviewing witnesses alongside trainee Lindy DeGeare, who eventually blew the whistle on the alleged corpse manipulation. Shot dead: Ramiro James Villegas, 22, had been shot dead on November 13 by Bakersfield Police after a car chase. Stringer allegedly 'played' with his body as it lay under a bloodied sheet . Let in: Stringer was allowed to see the body by a nurse at the Kern Medical Center, above . She said Stringer volunteered them to head to the Kern Medical Center in Bakersfield to help identify the body. It was there that a nurse gave them the passcode to the morgue where Villegas was being held. She said that when Stringer suggested she take a look at the body, she presumed it was part of legitimate training. Under California law, police officers are allowed to look at dead bodies to assess wounds, but are not supposed to handle them. According to the Bakersfield California, local prosecutors considered charging Stringer but dropped the case due to insufficient evidence. He is currently being investigated internally by the police department. A lawyer for the Villegas family said they are also 'very close' to filing a suit of their own.

        "article": "Former sports minister Gerry Sutcliffe says new allegations surrounding the Bradford City fire in 1985 which claimed 56 lives do not justify a new inquiry into the disaster. A new book claims that the fire at Valley Parade was just one of at least nine fires at businesses owned by or associated with the club's then chairman Stafford Heginbotham, who died in 1995. Sutcliffe, MP for Bradford South and deputy leader of Bradford City council at the time of the tragedy, says he knew Heginbotham 'flew by the seat of his pants' in terms of the finances of the club but remains convinced by the conclusion of the inquiry by high court judge Mr Justice Popplewell that the fire was an accident. A memorial to the people who dies in the 1985 fire at Valley Parade . The judge ruled the fire was started by a spectator dropping a cigarette into the rubbish that had accumulated under an old timber stand. Sutcliffe said: 'The inquiry by Mr Justice Popplewell concluded that it was caused by a discarded cigarette in what was an old wooden stand and I have not heard anything to convince me that that was not the case. 'Stafford Heginbotham was one of those football club chairmen of which there were many at the time who flew by the seat of his pants. I was deputy leader of the city council at the time and he was did fly by the seat of his pants when it came to paying the bill for the police and so on. The fire at Bradford City's Valley Parade claimed 56 victims and injured 265 on May 11, 1985 . 'But I think the inquiry was very thorough at the time and I don't think there needs to be another because of this. I do not believe there was any sort of cover-up and in fact the inquiry led to a lot of recommendations on stadiums that together with the Taylor report came up with the right answers for football. 'There will always be speculation but I just think it was a tragedy that cost the lives of 56 people and injured many more, and has scarred the city for many years.' The new claims are contained in the book 'Fifty-Six - The Story of the Bradford Fire' by Martin Fletcher, who was 12 at the time and escaped with his life from the blaze but lost three generations of his family including his father and brother. The book, published on Thursday and being serialised in The Guardian, does not make any direct allegations but Fletcher says Heginbotham's history with fires, which he claims resulted in payouts totalling around \u00a327million in today's terms, warranted further investigation. Then-Bradford chairman Stafford Heginbotham (left) with Mr Justice Popplewell in front of the burned stand . Gerry Sutcliffe does not believe a new inquiry into the Bradford fire is justified . 'Could any man really be as unlucky as Heginbotham had been?' he asks. West Yorkshire Police said the force would consider any new evidence about the fire. Detective Superintendent Mark Ridley, of the Homicide and Major Enquiry Team, said: 'The jury at the inquest in 1985 delivered a verdict of misadventure. 'However should any evidence come to light which was not available to Her Majesty's Coroner at the original inquest, then we will consider its significance and take appropriate action.' Fletcher's 11-year-old brother was the fire's youngest victim while his father John, 34, uncle Peter, 32, and grandfather Eddie, 63, also died. The disaster occurred at a time, according to Fletcher's evidence, when the businessman was in desperate financial trouble - and two days after he discovered it wo uld cost \u00a32million to bring the ground up to safety standards required by Bradford's promotion from the old Third Division. Yet this did not feature in the Popplewell Inquiry, which held its investigation only three weeks after the fire. Fletcher is the only survivor to publicly challenge the official inquiry, describing it as inadequate and saying it took place far too close to the event. The book is released on April 16. Nine days later a minute's silence is due to be held at every Premier League and Football League match to mark the forthcoming 30th anniversary.",

        "article": "Hillary Clinton has told a series of whoppers about her family history in order to appear more sympathetic to immigrants'-rights activists, according to documents that surfaced online Wednesday. Buzzfeed found U.S. Census records and Selective Service documents \u2013 draft cards \u2013 that establish that three of the former secretary of state's grandparents were born in America. That clashes with what Clinton herself has claimed publicly, including Wednesday afternoon in Norwalk, Iowa. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Clinton claimed on Wednesday that all of her grandparents 'came over' from other countries, but in fact only one was born outside the US . Hillary was participating in a staged 'roundtable' discussion about small business issues in Norwalk, Iowa . 'All my grandparents, you know, came over here,' she said during a small business roundtable event, 'and you know my grandfather went to work in lace mill in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and worked there until he retired at 65. He started there when he was a teenager and just kept going.' Clinton made the statment to underscore her support for changing the status of milions of illegal immigrants. 'We are turning down people who really want to work,' she said. 'I mean, they are here to work. And a lot of them now have children who are American citizens, and they are doing the best they can to try to make a good life for themselves and their families.' The underpinnings of her personal story, however, seem false. STAGING: Most reporters were kept out of the Capital City Fruit company 'for space reasons' although the warehouse had plenty of room to go around . Both of Clinton\u2019s maternal grandparents, named Della Howell and Edwin Howell, were born in Illinois, according to Buzzfeed's records research. And while her paternal grandfather, Hugh Rodham Sr., immigrated to the U.S, his wife Hanna Jones Rodham was born in Pennsylvania. In a speech last year in Kentucky, Clinton claimed Hanna 'immigrated with her family as a young girl to Scranton [Pennnsylvania] and went to work, very young, in a silk mill.' 'She traced her Methodism back to the Wesley brothers themselves,' Clinton said, 'who converted her great grandparents in the small coal mining villages of Southern Wales.' The Clinton camp quickly acknowledged the accurate Rodham family history. 'As has been correctly pointed out,' a campaign spokesperson told Buzzfeed, 'while her grandfather was an immigrant, it appears that Hillary\u2019s grandmother was born shortly after her parents and siblings arrived in the U.S. in the early 1880s.' But the insider insisted that Mrs. Clinton had simply believed what her family members had told her. 'Her grandparents always spoke about the immigrant experience and, as a result she has always thought of them as immigrants,' the spokesperson said.",

        "article": "Vince Cable prides himself on being the Tories' bogeyman in the Coalition Cabinet. 'I'm regularly voted their least popular Cabinet member,' he says with his familiar hangdog smile. Just as David Cameron and George Osborne privately describe Nick Clegg as a 'closet Conservative', they regard Cable a closet Labour politician. Not surprising, since he once was a Labour politician, albeit a councillor, in the 1970s. Scroll down for video . Vince Cable wants a substantial role in government and envisages working with the Conservatives again . Similarly, some Labour MPs fantasise that if only boyish Ed Miliband could have persuaded Uncle Vince, with his provincial bank manager's air and twinkly peacock blue eyes, to defect, Labour would walk the General Election. With Cable in charge of Labour's spending plans, voters would stop worrying that would-be PM Red Ed might do something barmy. But as we sit on the terrace of the quirkily named Barmy Arms pub by the Thames in his Twickenham constituency, Business Secretary Cable says something, which on first hearing, sounds even more barmy. Not only is he ready to spend another five years helping the Tories run Britain, he wants to replace George Osborne as Chancellor. 'Yes, I know,' he shrugs, acknowledging the apparent contradiction, 'I've spent my whole political life fighting the Conservatives.' How does he sit down with Tories he privately despises? 'When we have a business meeting we put the guns at the door and sit down and talk,' he smiles. He complains of 'nasty and vicious stuff' from the Tories. And after one heated Cabinet verbal exchange with Defence Secretary Liam Fox, Cameron rushed up to Cable on his way out and begged him to keep it secret to stop the Coalition collapsing. He describes another confrontation with junior Tory Business Minister Matt Hancock, an ally of Osborne sent to 'spy' on Cable. 'He came to my office with a list of plum jobs he wanted. I said, 'No, I'm the boss.' He was very cross, stamped his feet, got up and slammed the door.' So how, and more to the point, why, does Cable want another five years of more of the same? 'Because I've realised it is possible to be business-like with them. I can envisage a scenario in which I would stomach working with the Tories if the situation required. You have to let your head rule your heart.' In the interview, Mr Cable said the Prime Minister and the Chancellor were 'highly intelligent guys' and added that they 'don't snarl at each other' He knows full well the significance of what he is saying. 'It's important coming from me because I'm the one seen as having the least affinity with the Tories.' Cable is also quick to make clear he does not rule out working with Labour. But he 'envisages' remaining in a government led by Cameron, not Miliband. Cable says he would stop 'the nasty tail of Right-wing MPs wagging the Tory dog' if Cameron scrapes home. He denounces 'horrendous' public spending cuts proposed by Cameron and Osborne \u2013 'almost all affecting the disabled and working poor'. But with Cable, the difference is strictly political, not personal. In the next breath he says: 'Cameron and Osborne are highly intelligent guys and I respect their abilities. I have perfectly affable discussions with them. We don't snarl at each other.' His warm words for the Tories are all the more remarkable, bearing in mind that, around the corner, Conservative chiefs have sent extra teams of canvassers to Twickenham to try to 'decapitate' Cable. No one seriously thinks they can overturn his 12,000 majority. Giving a timely reminder to local Tories in his middle-class constituency, home of the chaps of the English Rugby Football Union and Hampton Court, of his fondness for Dave and George will do him no harm. They don't call him a wily old fox for nothing. His criticism of Miliband is all the more wounding, sounding like a disappointed father or headmaster. His warm words for the Tories are all the more remarkable, bearing in mind that, around the corner, Conservative chiefs have sent extra teams of canvassers to Twickenham to try to 'decapitate' Mr Cable . 'He could have done so much better and has made two really big mistakes. He should have said up-front on the financial crisis that we [the last Labour Government] screwed up seriously and done a mea culpa. 'And I feel let down by his foolish plan to cut university tuition fees to \u00a36,000. It is a low-grade response. He couldn't resist a cheap soundbite at our expense. Very poor judgment. And his fiscal policy is so vague.' Two days after the Election, Cable celebrates his 72nd birthday. Tall, tanned and languid, he looks lithe enough to reprise his dainty-toed appearance in Strictly Come Dancing in 2010. Yet, audaciously, the evergreen septuagenarian has set his sights on a new star turn \u2013 Chancellor in a Tory-led Government. 'I'm up for having a substantial role. My prime interest is the economy. There are two economic departments in Whitehall and I've done one of them for five years. I'll leave you to do the maths!' It sounds highly unlikely. Certainly less likely than a Lib Dem leadership contest if, as some predict, Clegg loses his seat. Cable loyally insists his party boss will survive and vehemently denies he wants his job. But canny Cable can't resist pointing out: 'I'm quite a bit younger than Gladstone, Churchill and Ronald Reagan.' All three led governments in their eighth decade. We can do the maths, Vince.",

        "article": "There is a passage in Diego Torres\u2019s book, 'The Special One - The Secret World of Jose Mourinho', which goes a long way to understanding the practices of Chelsea\u2019s manager. In the English version of Torres\u2019s biography, the exchanges between Mourinho and Cristiano Ronaldo in the dressing room at Real Madrid start on page 138 and finish five pages later. Here is an abridged version of the alleged events in the team meeting before the second leg of the 2011 Champions League semi-final against Barcelona, when Ronaldo had made it clear he expected Los Blancos to be more adventurous in the Bernabeu. Jose Mourinho makes a point to Oscar and his Brazilian team-mate Willian during a game at Stamford Bridge . Mourinho has been called out by players for being too defensive before, by Cristiano Ronaldo at Real Madrid . Oscar holds his head in his hands after missing a good chance at Stoke, where he was replaced at half time . Oscar hasn't completed a full 90 minutes for Chelsea since mid-January. Here is is full recent record: . Jan 31 Manchester City (substituted, 89) Feb 7 Aston Villa (substituted, 73) Feb 11 Everton (unused) Feb 17 Paris Saint Germain (substitute, 83) Feb 21 Burnley (substituted, 72) Mar 1 Tottenham (substitute, 88) Mar 4 West Ham (substituted, 74) Mar 11 Paris Saint Germain (substituted, 45) Mar 15 Southampton (substituted, 82) Mar 22 Hull (substitute, 61) Apr 4 Stoke (substituted, 45) According to Torres, the Real Madrid coach told his star player: \u2018I\u2019m going to say it to your face: you complain that we play defensively. But do you know why we play this way? For you. \u2018Because, as you don\u2019t want to defend or cover the wings, I have to have the team sitting deep... when you come on, you do your own thing.\u2019 That meeting, held in the presence of the great Zinedine Zidane, apparently lasted 40 minutes. Real Madrid drew the second leg 1-1 and Barcelona progressed to the final, where they beat Manchester United 3-1 at Wembley. Team meetings are a theme of Mourinho\u2019s management, giving his players the floor during the fallow periods that inevitably occur during the course of a long season. It is a pragmatic approach, one to be admired, unless you happen to be one of the players who challenges Mourinho\u2019s coaching philosophy. You cannot blame Oscar, the current fall-guy, for encouraging Chelsea to play with a sense of adventure at a team meeting that took place during their wobble at the end of January. When you can call upon Oscar, Eden Hazard and Willian, why wouldn\u2019t you? Oscar has been put back in his box in recent weeks, failing to start or finish a full 90 minutes in all competitions for Chelsea since the 1-0 victory over Liverpool in the Capital One Cup semi-final second leg on January 27. The Brazilian midfielder has failed to complete 90 minutes in any of Chelsea's last 11 games . Mourinho demands that the likes of Oscar work hard on their defensive roles to free Eden Hazard's flair . The Brazilian forward has not completed a Barclays Premier League match since the 5-0 victory at Swansea City, where he scored twice for the league leaders, 10 days earlier. Oscar put Chelsea ahead in the opening minute at the Liberty Stadium and his second, when he beat Swansea keeper Lukas Fabianski in the 36th minute from the edge of the area, is the last time he has scored. Since the 1-0 victory over Liverpool in the Capital One Cup at Stamford Bridge, Oscar has been substituted or been named substitute in 10 of Chelsea\u2019s last 11 fixtures. Here is the record in full. Manchester City (substituted, 89); Aston Villa (substituted, 73); Paris Saint-Germain (substitute, 83); Burnley (substituted, 72); Tottenham (substitute, 88); West Ham (substituted, 74); Paris Saint-Germain (substituted, 45); Southampton (substituted, 82); Hull (substitute, 61); Stoke (substituted, 45). Against Everton, on February 11, he was not in the squad. Naturally Oscar has some concerns, worried that his views at a routine team meeting have been misinterpreted by this most demanding of managers. Oscar was disappointing during last weekend's win, and Mourinho hit out at his performance afterwards . The Chelsea star tries a fancy flick but little of what he tried came off during the win against Stoke . It is believed to have been innocuous, an observation from a player who has been a popular and respectful member of the Chelsea dressing room since his move from Internacional in 2012. He is certainly not regarded as a troublemaker. It was Oscar, after all, who is so highly-regarded by the coaching staff at Chelsea that he was considered a potential, future rival to the annual duel between Lionel Messi and Ronaldo for the Ballon d\u2019Or. When Oscar returned from the World Cup, where he scored the 90th minute goal for his country in their 7-1 rout by Germany in the semi-final, his first-class attitude to the new season was noted by coaching staff. Despite the disappointment over the summer with the national team, he was eager to please Mourinho as he entered his third season with Chelsea. In November, his sparkling form was rewarded with a new five-year contract, a move designed to keep him in that role off the main striker, Diego Costa, until 2019. All was well. Oscar was dejected after Brazil's World Cup semi final defeat, but he returned to Chelsea with a good attitude . The Chelsea midfielder suggested the side should be more positive with the likes of Eden Hazard and Willian . When Oscar arrived at the club he was thought of as a future Ballon d'Or winner, but his place is now in doubt . There is a touch of Brian Clough about Mourinho\u2019s attitude towards him, a nod in the direction of the famous response he gave when asked about the way he dealt with disaffected players. \u2018We talk about it for 20 minutes and then we decide I was right all along,\u2019 Clough once remarked. Oscar is certainly learning all about that as he deals with Mourinho\u2019s mood swings. \u2018No, I don\u2019t think he had a bad performance, I just think his performance was not good enough, which is a huge difference,\u2019 claimed Chelsea\u2019s manager after their 2-1 victory over Stoke City on Saturday. Naturally there is a little uncertainty about Oscar\u2019s performances at the moment, reluctant to try anything out of the ordinary because of the potential consequences. Oscar knows, like everyone else knows, that if you take on Mourinho, he will take you off.",

Mourinho has been known to have a strong personality and can be harsh on players who challenge his coaching style."

        "article": "Manchester City will not compromise on quality in their search for homegrown players this summer. The proof that City have belief in English players was evident in Monday night\u2019s FA Youth Cup final where four of their starting line-up against Chelsea were born in Manchester. Another two have lived there from a young age. Manuel Pellegrini looked on with interest at City\u2019s Academy Stadium. Yet, while those fledglings carry much promise for the future, the fallen Premier League champions have a more immediate problem: they need eight homegrown players for their first-team squad next season to meet guidelines set out by the Premier League and are in danger of losing at least four. Manchester City will ask about\u00a0Raheem Sterling's availability even if Liverpool are likely to refuse to sell . Manuel Pellegrini watched City's academy in their FA Youth Cup final against Chelsea on Monday . The Premier League champions are also interested in signing Danny Ings (left) and\u00a0Jay Rodriguez (right) Frank Lampard, Scott Sinclair and Micah Richards will all leave while Richard Wright is expected to follow, and James Milner will decide his fate at the end of the season. Dedryck Boyata and John Guidetti are also ready to move. Milner\u2019s issue is not about money but understood to be about how many games he starts. He has figured in 27 Premier League matches this season but started just 14. The possibility of him departing means City have had to redress their buying strategy. Their track record of buying British has been questionable when you consider the impact made by Jack Rodwell, Sinclair and Adam Johnson. Further question marks have since been placed alongside recruitment decisions of last summer after City floundered in the Champions League and the domestic competitions. Indeed, the pressure is on all investments to make them a stronger Champions League proposition. Sporting director Txiki Begiristain wants Paul Pogba of Juventus, Kevin de Bruyne from Wolfsburg and took a flight to Munich yesterday to watch Porto attacker Yacine Brahimi and his team-mate Alex Sandro, a left back. They want young, hungry potentially world-class players but they also need at least some of them to be homegrown. Ross Barkley could be a City player next season but Everton want at least \u00a350m for the midfielder . Club chiefs will not compromise on quality and they are also interested in foreign stars including Paul Pogba . For that reason, City have to ask about Raheem Sterling even if Liverpool are likely to refuse to sell him. They have discussed signing Burnley forward Danny Ings \u2014 even though he doesn\u2019t want to be a peripheral figure \u2014 and Jay Rodriguez of Southampton, who will soon be fit again. His clubmate James Ward-Prowse is another promising talent admired by City. Everton\u2019s Ross Barkley and John Stones are others constantly mentioned but here lies City\u2019s problem: Everton would want at least \u00a350million for Barkley. It is a figure that has made City balk. As coach Manuel Pellegrini protested: \u2018It\u2019s important to have English players. Can you sign them? To improve this squad, you\u2019re talking players you can\u2019t get. Either they don\u2019t exist or clubs won\u2019t sell.\u2019 The search will intensify once City finish the season but the task will only get tougher. FA chairman Greg Dyke said it was \u2018depressing\u2019 to see City win the Premier League with just two Englishmen in their side last year and intends to introduce stricter rules on homegrown players from 2016. Pellegrini, if he's in charge next year, will need eight homegrown players for the first-team squad next season . James Milner was one of six homegrown players on their squad list this year, but could leave in the summer . He wants to phase them in over four years but it would mean players, irrespective of nationality, will have to be with their club from 15 to qualify as homegrown; the number of non-homegrown players in each 25-man squad is to be reduced from 17 to 13 and at least two homegrown players must be club-trained. Under those guidelines, City\u2019s Gael Clichy and Dedryck Boyata would no longer be classed as homegrown. \u2018I think it is important for big teams to bring in the best players, that is the most important thing,\u2019 said Pellegrini. \u2018I think about the academy we must be patient. This club built all these things because young players are important. \u2018Maybe it is not always easy for young players, especially in big teams, to play in the professional squad but I am sure in the future we will have important players to come from the academy and will be part of our squad.\u2019 While that wait goes on, City have no option but to put trust in their chequebook.",

Wisconsin will play Duke, an 81-61 winner over Michigan State in the earlier semi-final, at the Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis on Monday night. 'It gives us another 40 minutes, I know that,' said Wisconsin coach Bo Ryan, who leads the Badgers to their first final since 1941. Wisconsin celebrate a 71-64 victory over Kentucky in the semi-finals of the NCAA Tournament . Wisconsin players run onto the court in celebration as Kentucky's unbeaten season was brought to an end . Wisconsin moved through to the final with a tense victory over Kentucky at the Lucas Oil Stadium . And Kentucky has a long ride home, finishing the season at 38-1 - two wins short of becoming the first undefeated team in college basketball since the 1975-76 Indiana Hoosiers. Instead, these NBA-ready group of Wildcats join the star-studded 1991 UNLV team as the latest to take an undefeated record into the Final Four but lose in the semifinals. Trailing by four and gasping for breath after going 6 minutes without a bucket, the Badgers (36-3) responded with an 8-0 run to take a lead Kentucky couldn't overcome. Kaminsky and Bronson Koenig went 7 for 8 from the line over the last 24 seconds to seal the win. The 70,000-capacity Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, home of the Colts in the NFL, is hosting the Final Four . Wisconsin Badgers fans cheer on their team at the Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis . Kentucky's last, best chance came while trailing by three with 12 seconds left. But Karl-Anthony Towns received the ball in the post and got fouled. He made only one free throw, and from there, Wisconsin clinched it from the foul-line. Earlier Saturday, Justise Winslow scored 19 points and Jahlil Okafor added 18 to lead top-seeded Duke to an 81-61 victory over Michigan State on Saturday and a shot at its fifth national championship. Winslow, who played through some early foul trouble, had nine rebounds and was 5 for 7 from the field, while Okafor grabbed six rebounds and was 7 for 11 from the field. Duke celebrated reaching the final of the NCAA Tournament with a 81-61 win over Michigan State . Justise Winslow of the Duke Blue Devils goes up for a dunk in the semi-final in Indianapolis . Senior Quinn Cook had 17 points for the Blue Devils, who dominated the game except for the opening minutes when they trailed 14-6. Defensively, it was a team effort, just the way coach Mike Krzyzewski has stressed for his 35 seasons at Duke. What had been wide open 3-pointers early for Michigan State became contested shots and when the Blue Devils started getting up and on the Spartans, the points were suddenly tough to come by. Denzel Valentine finished with 22 points, which included hitting three quick 3-pointers in the first quarter to give the No.7 seed Michigan State an early lead. Trice scored 16 points and Branden Dawson added 12 for the Spartans.",

The merchandise was received a barrage of criticism on twitter with one one blogger Joanne Harris branding it a 'revolting piece of sexism'. The company removed the item from its website and told the Daily Telegraph at the time: 'As soon as this product was brought to our attention we withdrew it from sale and removed it from our website.'

'Tragic if people take this to heart, it's a joke book,' wrote another. When one critic @JoeBoy_AFC was branded a misogynist for his support of the joke book, he ranted across three tweets: 'Who said I'm an outright misogynist? Because I'm not crying about a jokebook?

Crew aboard Sea Shepherd vessel Bob Barker, which had been pursuing the ruined vessel named Thunder for 110 days in an effort to stop alleged poaching activities in Antarctic waters, found themselves taking on the role of saviours when the boat's distress signals were sounded. 'What was incredibly strange was that the captain of the Thunder, when the vessel did actually sink, started applauding and cheering, which I took to be very unusual behaviour and further evidence that he deliberately sank his own vessel,' Captain Peter Hammarstedt told Fairfax\u00a0media. Scroll down for video . Thunder, one of six vessels known to illegally fish vulnerable toothfish in the Southern Ocean, sunk\u00a0off the coast of Africa on Monday . Crew on Sea Shepherd vessel Bob Barker, which rescued those on board Thunder, said the captain of the now submerged ship was seen cheering . Sea Shepherd claims that Thunder is one of six vessels known to illegally fish vulnerable toothfish in the Southern Ocean. The conservation organisation's ships collected and delivered to authorities over 72 kilometres of illegal gillnet that it alleges was abandoned by the vessel in December. Thunder's sinking is believed to be another deliberate move by the vessel to hide evidence of any illegal activities. 'When my Chief Engineer boarded the Thunder in the hours leading up to the sinking, he was able to confirm that there were clear signs that the vessel was intentionally scuttled,' Captain Hammarstedt said. 'What was incredibly strange was that the captain of the Thunder, when the vessel did actually sink, started applauding and cheering,' Sea Shepherd Captain Peter Hammarstedt said . He added: 'I took to be very unusual behaviour and further evidence that he deliberately sank his own vessel' 'Usually when a vessel is sinking, the captain will close all hatches so as to maintain buoyancy. However, on the Thunder, the reverse was done - doors and hatches were tied open and the fishhold was opened. It is an incredibly suspicious situation, to say the least.' The alleged poaching vessel  issued a distressing signal, claiming that the ship was sinking at about 4.00pm on Monday. 'The Captain of Thunder radioed us and said their ship was sinking. We  launched our small boat and did everything we could to assist,' Mr Hammarstedt said. 'It appeared as though the ship and crew were in a serious situation.' All 40 crew members, who abandoned the sinking ship, were safely rescued and are being taken to the Sao Tome, in the Gulf of Guinea after receiving food, water and medical attention . The rescue was made despite numerous reports of violent behaviour from the vessel towards Bob Barker, including that crew had thrown grappling hooks at the ship and tried to ram it on more than one occasion . The rescue was made despite numerous reports of violent behaviour from the vessel towards Bob Barker, including that crew had thrown grappling hooks at the ship and tried to ram it on more than one occasion.

Operation Icefish has been very successful in exposing the operations of the alleged poachers and making connections between them and fishing companies in Spain. The Thunder  lost its nets, its catch and its profits for the entire season during the pursuit as they face prosecution in whichever port it is forced to go to once short of fuel and supplies. This four month chase was the longest pursuit of a poacher in maritime history, surpassing the 21-day pursuit of a Uruguayan poacher in 2003 by Australian Customs.

        "article": "Winemakers have been accused of fighting new EU regulations on revealing the calorie count on their\u00a0labels\u00a0because it will reveal that a bottle of red has the same as six digestives. The European Parliament is set to vote to close the current loophole, which sees all alcoholic drinks\u00a0exempt from having to reveal nutritional value on their labels, next week. However, European winemakers argue that introducing nutritional labelling would lead to an intolerable rise in production costs, and hit smaller vineyards. Closing the loophole: The European Parliament is set to vote on whether alcoholic beverages must include calorie counts on their labels . Under current EU regulations, producers of alcoholic drinks are not obliged to reveal the nutritional value of their products on the label. According to\u00a0The Times, winemakers  fear a fall in sales if consumers realise that 'a bottle of red wine has about the same amount of calories as half a packet of digestive biscuits'. But representatives of the European wine industry say the regulation would be devastating for smaller producers. As sugar and calorie levels varies with each vintage, this wound mean annual tests to provide accurate nutritional labelling. 'Obligatory nutritional labelling would lead to an intolerable rise in production costs,' said Aurora Abad, policy officer for the Comit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9en des Entreprises Vins, the wine industry's European body, told The Times. Fighting back: Winemakers say that introducing nutritional labelling would mean annual tests to extablish calories of each vintage, leading  to a rise in production costs that would mainly hit smaller vineyards . Ms Abad also said that as the nutritional value of a bottle of wine changes with age, the calories on the label would not be the same down the line. The European Commission was set to vote on whether to force producers of alcoholic drinks to display nutritional value on their labels in December, but the vote was delayed. Consumer and health organisations who have been pushing for a close of the loophole for alcoholic beverages say it's crucial to include calories on wine, beer and spirits so consumers can make 'informed choices'. 'At present consumers can have complete information about what is in a bottle of milk or fruit juice, but not a bottle of whisky or beer. We consider this unacceptable,' Monique Goyens, director-general of the European Consumer Organisation, said in a letter to the commission seen by the Times. This follows last year's calls from Britain's Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH) that labelling is needed in order to tackle obesity. Counting calories: Consumer and health organisations want wine producers to include calories on their bottles so drinkers can make 'informed choices' RSPH chief executive Shirley Cramer said: 'Calorie labelling has been successfully introduced for a wide range of food products and there is now a clear public appetite for this information to be extended to alcohol to help individuals make informed choices. 'With two in three adults overweight or obese, and given that adults who drink get approximately 10% of their calories from alcohol, this move could make a major difference to waistlines of the nation.' A poll in November 2014 found that a majority of UK adults either did not know or underestimated the number of calories in a glass of wine and a pint of lager. Alcohol contains seven calories per gram. A\u00a0large glass of white wine (250ml) contains on average 185 calories, a glass of champagne around 90 calories, a pint of lager some 180 calories while a double vodka and tonic around 145 calories.",

The 24-year-old has been billed as the next Ricky Hatton due to his impressive fan base and close to 10,000 packed into the First Direct Arena on Saturday night. Accompanied to the ring by Vinnie Jones, the featherweight was never in trouble but failed to deliver the stoppage that had looked a formality during the contest. Josh Warrington (right) poses with Vinnie Jones after his victory over Dennis Tubieron . 'A couple of times I thought would get him out of there. I was getting a bit bored by the end,' Warrington said. 'It was good to get 12 rounds. I want to get some experience under my belt.' The home favourite also picked up the vacant WBC International title which should improve his current ranking as he chases a world title shot within the next 12 months. Tubieron fought for the same belt last December when he drew with Carlo Magali and the Filipino's record of 19 wins from 24 fights suggested he would struggle against Warrington who is now unbeaten in 21 contests. The 24-year-old has been billed as the next Ricky Hatton due to his impressive fan base . Warrington admitted he was bored by the end of his fight against Dennis Tubieron (right) Tubieron, a year older than his opponent, had previously boxed at both bantamweight and lightweight before opting to settle for the division in between. And he was certainly the smaller man in the ring as Warrington made a fast start, picking the visitor off with punches to both head and body. Tubieron had previously been stopped twice and was content to fight on the back foot, his face marking up in the second round although the Filipino did attempt to mount a response. He briefly threatened midway through the third session with his first sustained attack but Warrington finished the stronger. Tubieron of the Philippines looks to land a punch during the bout at the First Direct Arena in Leeds . After an even fourth, Tubieron stepped on the accelerator in the fifth before Warrington fought back. Bizarrely, the bell to end the stanza did not ring until four minutes had passed, allowing the home favourite to drive home his advantage. Tubieron looked exhausted as he retreated to his corner but was given a brief break in the sixth round when a beach ball thrown from the crowd interrupted the action. The timekeeper then stopped the action almost 60 seconds early, attempting to rectify his earlier mistake. Judges awarded Warrington a landslide victory by scores of 119-109 twice and and 119-110 . Tubieron looked ready to fold several times during the seventh and eighth rounds before showing remarkable heart to find a response. If there has been a criticism of Warrington's career to date it is that he lacks the power needed at the top level and despite throwing everything at Tubieron, the Filipino was still standing at the start of the penultimate round. And he deservedly heard the final bell as Warrington failed to deliver the stoppage in the last session before the judges awarded him a landslide victory by scores of 119-109 twice and and 119-110.

        "article": "(CNN)On Thursday, NPR -- headquartered in Washington, just 40 miles away from Baltimore -- ran its latest update on the urban turmoil that has erupted in the wake of the death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray because of still-unexplained spinal injuries that occurred while he was under police custody. Unfortunately, while it was a freshly produced segment, it was hardly a new story. Titled \"Baltimore Unrest Reveals Tensions Between African-Americans And Asians,\" the five-minute piece is urgently introduced with the promise that it will reveal \"what's really happening in the more troubled neighborhoods of this majority black city,\" going on state that a key ingredient of the unrest was African-Americans \"targeting Asian-owned businesses for destruction.\" A similar claim was made after Ferguson's uprising in August of last year. Indeed, it has been a toxic feature of the coverage of many episodes of mass metropolitan violence since the late 1980s, the era during which the trope of widespread hostility between Asian and black communities first took root in the media consciousness. Yes, interethnic tensions continue to exist, though they are hardly limited to Asians and blacks. And yes, this has resulted in troubling incidents and tragedies on both sides. But while reports say that during the chaotic social breakdowns of the past year, black-owned businesses were mostly protected during bouts of violence, there's little evidence to suggest a pattern in which Asian businesses have been actively targeted out of racial animus. Instead, it seems as if Asian-owned stores have experienced damage partly because they make up a portion of establishments operating in the most economically vulnerable and socially volatile of neighborhoods. In other words, they were collateral damage, along with other stores in the vicinity of riots. So it's time to call this persistent meme what it is: A misleading, hyperbolic and dangerous distraction, one that shifts blame away from the real issues. As Jennifer Lee, sociology professor at University of California, Irvine, and author of the 2002 book \"Civility in the City: Blacks, Jews and Koreans in Urban America,\" notes, \"the mainstream media continues to pit minority groups against one another to draw attention from larger structural problems that plague poor, disadvantaged communities. By directing our attention to interminority conflict, it directs blame away from the structures that perpetuate gross inequality and toward individual problems.\" Let's be honest. There were then -- and still are -- legitimate issues that exist between immigrant storeowners and the largely African American customers they serve that are rooted in extensive cultural differences. There's no denying that friction exists in the daily transaction between embattled communities trying hard to coexist under economic and social pressures. For example, in 1993, the robbery and shooting of Joel Lee, a 21-year-old Korean American at Towson State University, and the subsequent acquittal of his killer, was a point of contention between the Korean and African American communities. But things are different now. Decades after the height of media-inflamed tension between Asian and African Americans, patterns of immigration have shifted. Stores once operated by recent Korean immigrants are now owned by strivers from South Asia, the Middle East and Africa. The population of Baltimore has shrunk and its economy has contracted. Among merchants, there's ever-greater recognition that they and their customers are tied by a red thread, surviving or failing together. For decades, black and Asian advocacy groups have been trying to bridge differences between the communities. For example, the Baltimore-based Korean-American Grocers & Licensed Beverage Association of Maryland, founded in 1995, has worked to support its entrepreneurial members in their own attempts to address longstanding issues of neglect and abuse by Baltimore's police, while also encouraging them to build deeper ties with their constituents. A KAGRO-sponsored annual scholarship program has given hundreds of thousands of dollars in college grants to children growing up in the Baltimore neighborhoods their member retailers serve. These aren't the kind of stories you'll hear in the media. It's easier to focus on attention-grabbing anecdotes rather than the long, hard work of adjustment and accommodation going on within and around communities. Back in 1995, the Baltimore Sun profiled Soon Jae and Eun Ja Lee, owners of Lee's Food Market in the West Baltimore's Sandtown neighborhood -- the same part of the city that NPR called out as a locus of Asian-black tension. The story highlighted the Lees' openness to the community, their politeness and care for their customers and their outstanding generosity, which includes both free snacks to schoolchildren and the distribution of tens of thousands of free food baskets to needy local families each year. I spoke with Eun Ja Lee, calling her without warning to check on the status of the Lees' four-decade-old business after the violence of Monday and Tuesday. Were they open? Were they safe? \"Oh, of course we're open, we're always open!\" said Mrs. Lee, warmly and brightly. \"This week, many customers came in and said to me 'Mrs. Lee, don't worry you are part of our community, you are our family. We will make sure you are OK -- just stay open!' We love it. We love it.\" And yet, no one has come and interviewed her at their untouched and fully operational family market, nor have they talked with her customers, stoutly loyal after 37 years of patronage. Reinforcing the tired narrative of black-Asian interracial tension generates heat, but not light. There's a far more complex and nuanced relationship between these two urban populations, one that is in an ongoing state of evolution -- and it deserves to be told, not buried under cliches and clickbait.",

The 41-year-old man - identified only by his initials S.G. - is said to have posted a 'blasphemous' status on his Facebook page after watching a news bulletin about the war in Iraq on television last July. If found guilty, the suspect could face up to seven years in jail, a fine of between Dh250,000 to Dh1 million, or both. The Indian salesman faces imprisonment after he allegedly shared a 'blasphemous' status on his Facebook page. He told police he was sent the image over Whatsapp, but allegedly then admitted to posting the status . The 41-year-old is accused by the prosecution of posting the derogatory statements about Islam and the Prophet Mohammad after watching a news item about the Iraq war, pictured, in July last year . Lawyers for the prosecution said the man abused the social media network - namely Facebook - and the telephone communication system by cursing the Prophet and Islam, according to Gulf News. They are now looking for the toughest punishment possible under the country's cyber-crime laws. Islam is the official religion of the United Arab Emirates, and committing blasphemy is considered deeply offensive. Authorities in the country routinely censor newspapers and books that they consider contain blasphemous statements or anything critical of Islam. In the latest case, the accused salesman claimed he received the offending image over Whatsapp while he was at home . He then complained to police that he had receiving the image - but is reported to have later admitted to prosecutors that he was the one who posted the status on Facebook. The Indian employee, known only by his initials S.G., failed to attend the hearing at the Dubai Court of First Instance on Monday. The United Arab Emirates treats blasphemy as a serious criminal offence . The defendant apparently told prosecutors that he wrote the 'blasphemous' curses after watching video footage about the way in Iraq. His IPhone was seized and sent to a laboratory for forensic examination, and lawyers said the mobile was registered to the indian man's name. The accused failed to attend the Dubat Court of First Instance on Monday, and presiding judge Abdul Lat adjourned the case until the next hearing on April 27.

        "article": "EU leaders have agreed a package of measures to tackle the escalating migrant crisis in the Mediterranean \u2013 with pledges to send in warships and triple funding for rescue patrols. After years of dithering, an emergency EU summit yesterday agreed to lay the groundwork for military action against traffickers after the deaths of some 1,700 refugees in the last week alone. Within days, British warship\u00a0HMS Bulwark and the German supply ship Berlin are expected to be sent to the region in the biggest sign of the European Union's belated commitment to the cause. Prime Minister David Cameron, who is two weeks from a national election in which immigration is a major issue, stressed that Britain was not planning to bring any more migrants back to the UK. Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, whose country has been faced with almost daily tragedy as rescuers pluck bodies from the sea, called the EU measures 'a giant step forward.' But other EU leaders were less optimistic, with Malta's prime minister, Joseph Muscat, saying the assets being proposed would 'never be enough' to address the problem. 'A giant step forward': Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi speaks after EU leaders agreed a package of measures to tackle the growing migrant crisis including extra military and a tripling of funding for patrols . Jovial: Danish Prime minister Helle Thorning Schmidt and her British counterpart David Cameron embrace before posing for a family photo during a European Union leaders summit in Brussels . The pledge of resources came as victims of the worst-ever migrant disaster in the Mediterranean were buried Thursday in Malta. Two dozen wooden caskets containing the only bodies recovered from a weekend capsizing off Libya that left at least 800 migrants feared dead were laid out for a memorial service. None of the bodies was identified: One casket had 'No 132' scrawled on it, referring to the number of the DNA sample taken from the corpse in case a relative ever comes to claim it. For several years as death tolls mounted, EU leaders have done little more than deplore the loss of lives and mark tragedies with moments of silence and wreaths instead of fundamental action. When Libya disintegrated politically after the overthrow of longtime leader Muammar Gaddafi and unrest spread in neighboring countries, Europe failed to take forceful action. Yesterday, EU leaders pledged to do more, committing at least nine vessels to monitor the waters for traffickers and intervene in case of need. Other member states, from France to Latvia, also lined up more ships, planes and helicopters that could be used to rescue migrants. The member states agreed to triple funding to \u20ac9million (\u00a37m) a month for the EU's border operation that patrols the Mediterranean. Seek and destroy: Britain will send one of its biggest warships, HMS Bulwark (above), to the Mediterranean within days as part of plans to targets boats used by human traffickers . Escalating crisis: A migrant is stretchered off to hospital by the Italian Red Cross at the port of Salerno after being rescued by the tanker Chimera along with 545 other refugees in the Mediterranean . They also assigned EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini to line up the diplomatic options that would allow EU militaries to strike against the boats used by traffickers. Officials said the lack of a strong Libyan government would likely make UN backing necessary. 'Leaders have already pledged significantly greater support, including many more vessels, aircraft and experts' than had been anticipated before the summit, EU President Donald Tusk said. Despite the sudden deluge of goodwill, huge questions remained about whether it would be enough to defeat the smugglers and human traffickers. 'Right now, it's a question of fixing yesterday's errors,' French President Francois Hollande said. He said the EU would hold a summit in Malta with African countries by this summer to see how the continents can work together to better deal with a crisis that has grown dramatically in recent years. In contrast to the Italian premier, the head of another Mediterranean nation on the frontline of the tragedies was far less enthusiastic. For tiny Malta, the smallest EU member state with a population of 450,000, the summit produced nothing particularly new, apart from a fresh resolve to break up the smuggling networks. The assets being proposed 'will never be enough,' Malta's prime minister, Joseph Muscat said. 'It is definitely not enough if the numbers that are being communicated about prospective migratory flows are anything to go by.' On the offensive: EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini (pictured) has been assigned to line up the diplomatic options that would allow EU militaries to strike against the boats used by traffickers . In the past week alone, more than 10,000 people have been plucked from the seas between Italy and Libya as desperate migrants fleeing war and poverty threw their lot in with smugglers who charged up to $2,000 for a spot on overcrowded boats to make the perilous crossing. At least 1,300 people have died in April alone, putting 2015 on track to be the deadliest year ever. Ending that is Europe's main challenge. Even optimists say any measures agreed at Thursday's summit would not fully stem the tide of unstable ships crossing the Mediterranean. But Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte insisted that Europe should not take the brunt of blame. 'We also ask that Africa, the source of the problem, also collectively takes up its responsibility,' Rutte said. 'Last time I checked Libya was in Africa, not Europe.' German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande arrive at an EU emergency summit in Brussels seeking a solution to the migrants crisis . Over the past year, what little political structure Libya had has collapsed. There are two rival governments, neither with any real authority, and each fighting the other on the ground. Local militias hold sway around the country, some of them with hard-line Islamist ideologies, and the Islamic State group has emerged as a strong and brutal force. The makes any military action against traffickers there even more complicated. 'Any kind of military action can only be based on international law,' said German Chancellor Angela Merkel. 'There are two possibilities: either a U.N. Security Council Resolution or a unity government in Libya. We have neither at the moment.' Europe itself was hardly a picture of unity when it came to the difficult issue of resettling migrants. Countries like Germany, Sweden, France and Italy have dealt with a disproportionate number of asylum requests while many eastern and Baltic member states take hardly any. Five of the 28 member states are handling almost 70 per cent of the migrants coming in. Still, despite the differences, Finland's prime minister Alexander Stubb was hopeful that this time Europe could put up a show of solidarity. 'I hope we'll get it right this time,' he said.",

        "article": "Drinking two cups of coffee a day could halve the risk of breast cancer returning, a study found. A cancer-killing cocktail of the hormone drug tamoxifen and two coffees every day was found to reduce the risk of tumours returning by 50 per cent in women recovering from the disease, researchers said. Tamoxifen kills off cancer cells or stunts their growth by blocking the cancer-causing hormone oestrogen from reaching diseased cells. Women who have suffered from breast cancer can slash the chances of the cancer returning by half - if they enjoy two cups of coffee a day, as well as taking hormone drug tamoxifen (picture posed by model) It is the main drug given to women who have not been through the menopause, and is usually taken for five years or longer after breast cancer treatment. And when combined with two cups coffee, it can be even more effective, according to a study of 1,090 breast cancer patients by British and Swedish researchers at Lund University, Sweden. Their findings found that women who had been treated with tamoxifen - and those that had drunk at least two cups of coffee a day - had only half the risk of their cancer returning than those who drank less coffee, or none at all. Ann Rosendahl, a researcher from Lund University who carried out the study, said: \u2018The study also shows that those who drank at least two cups of coffee a day had smaller tumours and a lower proportion of hormone-dependent tumours. \u2018We saw that this was already the case at the time of diagnosis.\u2019 The study also found that breast cancer cells react with caffeine and caffeic acid, which are both found in the hot drink. Caffeine caused the cells to divide less frequency - and die more often - especially when it was drunk in combination with tamoxifen. Mrs Rosendahl said: \u2018This shows that these substances have an effect on the breast cancer cells and turn off signalling pathways that the cancer cells require to grow.\u2019 Researches found caffeine causes breast cancer cells to divide less frequently and divide more often . Taking prescribed medicine is still vitally important to treating cancer, clinicians have stressed . Despite their findings, the study\u2019s researchers were keen to stress the importance of prescribed medication in treating cancer . \u2018They are incredibly important, but if you like coffee and are also taking tamoxifen, there is no reason to stop drinking it. Just two cups a day is sufficient to make a difference,\u2019 Mrs Rosendahl said. Previous studies have found that drinking coffee could reduce the risk of cancer in heavy drinkers. And the World Cancer Research Fund believe the hot drink can protect against liver cancer, which is often associated with alcohol abuse. Experts from the Harvard Medical School have also found that women who drink three or more cups of coffee a day have a 20 per cent lower risk of developing skin cancer, compared with those who had less than one a month . Responding to the study, Jackie Harris, clinical nurse specialist at Breast Cancer Care, said: \u2018Though this is an interesting study much more research is needed before we can fully understand the effects coffee and caffeine can have on tumour growth or risk of recurrence. \u2018Making small changes, like maintaining a healthy weight and taking regular exercise, can help reduce the risk of breast cancer returning.'",

Jim Jepps used a blog called The Daily Maybe to defend 'rape fantasies', describe paedophiles as 'complex human beings' and question why teachers who have relationships with pupils are put on the sex offenders register. The couple met five years ago when Ms Bennett contacted him to correct something he had written about her, but now the Green party stresses they do not 'want to be associated' with his internet rants. Scroll down for video . Green party leader Natalie Bennett has distanced herself from the bizarre blog posts of her boyfriend Jim Jepps, insisting he is a 'private individual not involved in party politics' Ms Bennett's profile has soared in recent months, buoyed by rising poll ratings and Green party membership in England passing 60,000 for the first time. However, little is known about her private life, in contrast to the spouses of David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg who have been frequently seen on the campaign trail. Ms Bennett has been dating Mr Jepps for five years, after meeting online. He continued blogging on the Daily Maybe site until 2011. He quit the Socialist Workers Party in around 2003 and later joined the Greens. Bizarrely, he left the party in 2012, the year Ms Bennett replaced the more high-profile Caroline Lucas as Green leader. On his website, Mr Jepps appears to have deliberately courted controversy with a series of controversial blog posts, often related to sex, rape or paedophiles. In one post, seen by MailOnline, he joked that gay sex is not a sin 'unless you do it really well or claim it on expenses'. In 2007, he tackled a news story about demands for music books written by a paedophile to be withdrawn, because the recorder lessons were used to groom victims. Mr Jepps wrote: 'We can burn these books as a public statement against the author (who is in jail for his crimes) or try to understand that whatever monstrous acts individuals commit they are still complex human beings for all that. 'Good, evil, interesting and banal by turns - not devils who can taint everything they touch with evil.' He also dismissed a case in which a blogger was charged with obscenity for writing an article imagining the kidnap and murder of the pop group Girls Aloud. 'Either I'm hopelessly jaded or getting depraved and corrupted is a lot duller than I remember\u2026 Personally I didn't find it that shocking.' Mr Jepps quit the Green party in 2012, the same year Ms Bennett became leader after replacing Caroline Lucas (left) According to the Sunday Mirror another posting included: 'New Poll: Sex with pupils - good idea/bad idea? Personally I'm ambivalent and would appreciate any guidance. 'It seems to me the sex offenders register is a sledgehammer to crack a nut sometimes. When you have a teacher who kissed a 17-year-old placed on the same register as Gary Glitter it does make you wonder how useful the list is, no matter how creepy that teacher might be.' Another post entitled 'Even monsters have feelings' is said to have covered the case of Austrian schoolgirl Natascha Kampusch, who was kidnapped aged 10 by Wolfgang P\u0159iklopil and held in a cellar for . Mr Jepps wrote: 'These are two people who had a long term and human relationship.' Ms Bennett and Mr Jepp reportedly share a flat she bought for \u00a3249,950 in 2007 in North London. Last night the Green Party distanced itself from Mr Jepp's remarks. A spokesman said: 'The Daily Maybe was a personal blog written by Mr Jepps until 2011. 'The party does not endorse the views expressed and would not want to be associated with them. Jim Jepps has not been a member of the party since 2012.' Ms Bennett said: 'Jim is a private individual not involved in party politics. I will not be commenting on words he's said or written.'",

        "article": "An Arizona man who suffers from an extreme case of a tumor disorder in which his body is covered in noncancerous lumps said he finally has a feeling of belonging. Bob Heslip, 50, suffers from Neurofibromatosis type 1, or NF-1, which is caused by a gene malfunction that causes the bubble-like bumps to appear all over his body. However, he says he feels comfortable in his skin for the first time in his life now that he has joined the Venice Beach Freakshow  where he has met performers including a bearded lady and America's smallest couple. 'When I met the performers, there was a feeling of belonging. I felt at home,' Heslip told The Huffington Post. Scroll down for video . Bob Heslip (pictured), 50, who suffers from Neurofibromatosis type 1, or NF-1, has joined the Venice Beach Freakshow and said for the first time in his life he feels comfortable in his skin . The noncancerous lumps began appearing on his body around puberty and became more severe as he aged . Heslip, who works at a Dollar Tree in Tuscon, said around eight months ago he was on vacation with his family in Los Angeles when they saw the Freakshow, as his daughter is a fan of the TV show. Todd Ray, the owner, saw Heslip and recognized his condition as NF-1 and began talking to him. 'I went to the front, took off my shirt and the crowd went crazy,' Heslip told the Huffington Post. He accepted Ray's offer to join the show as the 'Bubble Boy' a few weeks ago and said it gives him the platform to talk about his condition to people who otherwise just stare. For Heslip, the tumors on his body began appearing around puberty but became more severe as he aged. He noted that when he got married 25 years ago he did not have any bumps on his face, but now he does. 'I don't feel a lot of pain from the bumps,' Heslip told The Huffington Post. 'I have a large bump on the side of my body that used to be very sensitive, but not so much now.' To have the tumors surgically removed is not an option for him as he said it is not guaranteed that they will not grow back or possibly grow back larger than before. Heslip said: 'When I met the performers, there was a feeling of belonging. I felt at home' Staying in hiding from the public is also not an option as he has a family including his wife and children to support. Ray said that some people will see Heslip's hands and will not want him to touch their items while he is working because they think he is contagious. As Heslip manages his job in Tuscon and his new role as a performer, he feels comfortable in his skin for the first time in his life because of the Venice Beach Freakshow. The job which he works on the weekends is also making it possible for him to talk to others about NF-1. 'I want to teach people that it's not taboo to ask questions. I'm OK talking about it,' he told the Huffington Post. 'My son and oldest daughter also have this condition and my speaking out about it gets them excited. They know my attitude is positive.' Heslip joins performers including Asia Ray, Morgue, Jessa the Bearded Lady, Larry the Wolf Boy and Miss Sunshine as part of the Venice Beach Freakshow (pictured above) Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) is one of the most common inherited neurological disorders affecting around one in every 3,000 people. NF-1 ranges from mild to severe and can cause more symptoms in some people than in others. The condition primarily affects the skin, the nervous system and the eyes, and most people with NF-1 have recognizable signs before the age of 10. The most common symptoms include six or more light brown skin spots (caf\u00e9 au lait spots), freckles in unusual places, such as under the arms and in the groin, colored bumps on the iris (Lisch nodules) and Neurofibromas. Regardless if the NF-1 gene change was inherited from a parent or is newly affected, every person who has an NF-1 gene change has a 50 per cent chance of passing it on every time they have a child. Genetic testing for the NF-1 gene is available and can be coordinated for families in which testing would be appropriate. Source: Johns Hopkins Medicine .",

        "article": "Ferguson, Missouri (CNN) [Breaking news update at 11:45 p.m. ET] . Two African-Americans -- Ella Jones and Wesley Bell -- were elected to the Ferguson City Council on Tuesday, meaning three of the six council members are black. [Previous story, published at 6:52 p.m. ET] . The skies grew ominous and the radio crackled with warnings of flash floods. Amid the rain, Ferguson opened its polls at 6 a.m. for municipal elections that traditionally have drawn very few out to vote. But today was different. This was the first city election since white police Officer Darren Wilson shot and killed unarmed black teenager Michael Brown last August. Since then, this St. Louis suburb of 21,000 people has gone through epic upheaval with revelations of systemic discrimination against African-Americans by law enforcement and the courts. There's widespread feeling, especially in the African-American community, that if the turnout is low, then all the protests, the investigations, the calls for change will have been in vain. St. Louis elections officials said they had no indication that turnout in Tuesday's election would be any different than other years. But among the candidates inspired to run by the events that transpired here, there was hope of seeing greater voter participation. \"That is what our democracy is about,\" said Wesley Bell, a 40-year-old lawyer and criminal justice professor who also is a part-time municipal judge in nearby Velda City. Bell is running against Lee Smith, a retired electrical plant employee, in Ward 3. That area includes Canfield Drive, where Brown was killed, and the West Florissant Avenue business corridor that felt the brunt of the protests and the vandalism. Charred, heavily damaged buildings stand as scars of Ferguson's despair and anger. Both Bell and Smith are black, And no matter the outcome, one of them will double the African-American representation on the council. Even though 70% of Ferguson's 21,000 people are black, five of the six current City Council members and the mayor are white. The council was cited along with the Ferguson Police Department, which has three black officers, as a symbol of white power in a majority black city. \"We have to get out of this law enforcement for business,\" said candidate Doyle McClellan, coordinator of the computer network security program at Lewis and Clark Community College. McClellan referred to the scathing report by the U.S. Department of Justice that found Ferguson issued fines and traffic tickets to generate revenue for the city. \"That's not a good thing,\" McClellan said as he stood in the drizzle at a polling station, hoping to persuade voters who were still undecided. The polls close here at 7 p.m. Results are not expected until a few hours later. Ted Heidemann, a 67-year-old retired airline pilot, said he voted for Brian Fletcher, a former mayor who launched the \"I Love Ferguson\" campaign last fall to raise money for mom and pop businesses that were hurt by the looting and vandalism. Some residents see Fletcher as being a part of the establishment, part of the problem. But Heidemann asked why no one complained when Fletcher was mayor. He said Brown's shooting brought a lot of bad things to light. \"We didn't realize the effect some of the institutional problems had on poor people,\" he said. \"Some things need to be changed and we are aware of that.\" By midafternoon, Fletcher said the numbers looked good. At a church where voters from all three wards were casting ballots, he predicted a 40-50% turnout. When the rain let up for a few minutes, a stream of voters trickled into the First Presbyterian Church in downtown Ferguson to cast their votes. Ellory and Kathy Glenn both voted for Bob Hudgins, a political novice who attracted attention as a white man who routinely stood with protesters on the front lines. He speaks often of having married a black woman and having a biracial teenage son. \"I wanted change,\" said Ellory Glenn, 60, who is black. His wife is white. He said the couple moved to Ferguson after he retired from the Marine Corps in 1995 because they felt it was a racially welcoming place. But now, after all the problems rose to the surface, it's time for fresh blood on the City Council, Glenn said. That's why they chose Hudgins over Fletcher. \"Quit using law enforcement as a revenue stream,\" he said. \"That's like using the military to go into places and looting them. The police are supposed to keep order.\" Angela Jackson came to the polls with her husband and two little girls in tow. She voted for Ella Jones, a former Mary Kay cosmetics sales director who resigned her job in January to run for office. Jackson echoed the thoughts of other Ferguson residents who experienced something new in this election: candidates coming to their door. Past elections have not seen the kind of canvassing activity that took place in the last few weeks. \"One thing we really liked is (Jones) came to our door and talked to us about her desire to make change in our neighborhood,\" Jackson said. \"She's going to be hands on. She lives in the neighborhood as well, and has for the past 36 years. We were kind of taken by that.\" Fletcher, the former mayor turned City Council candidate, campaigned that Ferguson would benefit from his experience more than a newcomer, saying his contacts from almost three decades in politics would be an invaluable asset in getting Ferguson back on its feet. \"I understand that feeling,\" Fletcher said of those who feel he's too entrenched in the city's old guard, \"but those individuals don't know me.\" The city is required to approve a new budget by the end of June and the new council will have to look for alternative sources of revenue to replace the $3 million or so lost from money generated by traffic tickets and fines. \"That amount will drop significantly,\" Fletcher said. The rain began to fall again as the Glenns got in their car. It was expected to continue off and on through the day and night. But about 5, just when many voters were leaving work, the sun shone brilliantly. Overheard at one precinct: Good weather brought out the worst in Ferguson last August. Maybe today, it would bring out the best.",

Restaurateurs in the country are so angry with the US corporation, the largest chain of burger restaurants in the world, for attacking their cultural diet that have said they will take them to court. The row erupted over an 18 second video advert advert which appeared to prove that kids preferred a Happy Meal to a margherita pizza. Scroll down for video .

The advert opens in a traditional Italian restaurant where the young Italian boy appears bored by the pizzas . A top pizza chef described the advert 'blasphemy' and the True Neapolitan Pizza Association has accused McDonald's of a 'shameful' attack. The McDonald's spot shows a waiter in a traditional pizza restaurant asking a small boy, who is peering at a menu with his parents, which pizza he would like. He replies he wants 'A Happy Meal', and the camera then pans to a shot of the family sitting in a McDonald's with his meal. At the end of the advert a voice says: 'Your little boy had no doubt.' Massimo Di Porzio, vice president of The True Neapolitan Pizza Association in Naples, said: 'We've had enough of them making money at the expense of children's health. 'Our legal team is looking at the possibility of legal action to put an end to this shameful attack on a symbol of the Mediterranean diet.

Drivers pulled over on Interstate 20 in Albilene, Texas, got out of their cars and walked toward oncoming traffic to pick up the cash. A video posted on Facebook\u00a0shows motorists frantically grabbing the notes in between stopped vehicles, while others were forced to slow down and veer out of the way. Scroll down for video . Chaos: A video posted on Facebook captured motorists pulling over and getting out of their cars on Interstate 20 in Albilebe, Texas, \u00a0to pick up cash that had spilled from a Brinks Armored Truck . The passenger door of the truck somehow opened as it was moving causing a plastic bag with a 'substantial amount of money' to be blown out. Police have warned that if anyone is caught with cash that was inside the truck - they could land themselves behind bars. Weatherford Police Department said all of the lost money had been picked up by citizens. Some of it had been returned, but other drivers had decided to ignore the threats and have pocketed the cash. A spokesman for the department said: 'Weatherford Police Department would like to remind everyone that the loose money is property of Brinks Armored Car Service. 'Weatherford Police will investigate and potentially prosecute any individual that has picked up any of the loose money and not returned it to either Brinks or the Police Department.' Joel Aldridge, who recorded the video, told NBC DFW: 'I saw people all over the ground picking things up, and I thought maybe it was wreckage. 'And as they started walking toward me the first guy I saw had a big wad of cash with money sticking out.' Traffic: Cars were forced to veer past the vehicles stopped on the side of the road. Police have also warned anyone caught with the money from the van will be prosecuted . He described how dozens of people vacated their cars and left their doors ajar as they dashed for the cash. 'Everybody else was picking up handfuls and running around, kinda like an Easter egg hunt,' he added.' Jose Rosas, who was searching at the scene, told WFAA: 'We're just trying to make a dollar or two. 'I'm probably going to come back tomorrow and look,' Rosas said. 'I know there's a lot of money out here.' His friend Gage Anderson said they had scoured the road but most of the money had already been picked up.",

        "article": "While Google and Apple are developing self driving vehicles, Nasa has revealed its vision - and its a lot more fun. Called the Modular Robotic Vehicle, or MRV, it was developed at NASA's Johnson Space Center to show off the technologies that could let man move across other planets. On Earth, however, it also has some neat tricks - from the ability to park sideways to being able to spin on the spot, as well as being driven remotely at up to 70mph. Watch the buggy in action below . Unlike a normal car, the buggy has\u00a0no mechanical linkages to the propulsion, steering, or brake actuators, the driver of an MRV relies completely on control inputs being converted to electrical signals and then transmitted by wires to the vehicle's motors. A turn of the steering wheel, for instance, is recorded by sensors and sent to computers at the rear of the vehicle. These computers interpret that signal and instruct motors at one or all four of the wheels to move at the appropriate rate, causing the vehicle to turn as commanded. Nasa says the vehicles was buit 'in order to advance technologies that have applications for future vehicles both in space and on Earth.' 'With seating for two people, MRV is a fully electric vehicle well-suited for busy urban environments, it says. MRV is driven by four independent wheel modules called e-corners. Each e-corner consists of a redundant steering actuator, a passive trailing arm suspension, an in-wheel propulsion motor, and a motor-driven friction braking system. Each e-corner can be controlled independently and rotated \u00b1180 degrees about its axis. This allows for a suite of driving modes allowing MRV to maneuver unlike any traditional vehicle on the road. In addition to conventional front two wheel steering, the back wheels can also articulate allowing for turning radiuses as tight as zero. The driving mode can be switched so that all four wheels point and move in the same direction achieving an omni-directional, crab-like motion. This makes a maneuver such as parallel parking as easy as driving next to an available spot, stopping, and then operating sideways to slip directly in between two cars. 'This two-seater vehicle was designed to meet the growing challenges and demands of urban transportation,' said Mason Markee, also with Johnson. 'The MRV would be ideal for daily transportation in an urban environment with a designed top speed of 70 km/hr and range of 100 km of city driving on a single charge of the battery. 'The size and maneuverability of MRV gives it an advantage in navigating and parking in tight quarters.' With a designed top speed of around 70 km/hr, test driving proved to be a bit of fun. Justin Ridley told an Nasa magazine: 'It's like driving on ice but having complete control. 'It's a blast to ride in and even more fun to drive. We've talked about it being like an amusement park ride. 'The 'fun' of driving was not something we tried to design for, just something that came out of the design. 'Once we got it running many of us commented that we had no idea it was going to be able to do the things it does.' 'This work also allowed us to develop some technologies we felt were needed for our future rovers,' said Ridley. The driver controls MRV with a conventional looking steering wheel and accelerator/brake pedal assembly. The driving mode can be switched so that all four wheels point and move in the same direction - perfect for parallel parking. 'These include redundant by-wire systems, liquid cooling, motor technology, advanced vehicle control algorithms. 'We were able to learn a lot about these and other technologies by building this vehicle.' The buggy can also be controlled remotely, and in the future Nasa says this system can be expanded to allow for autonomous driving. The driver controls MRV with a conventional looking steering wheel and accelerator/brake pedal assembly. Both of these interfaces were specially designed to mimic the feel of the mechanical/hydraulic systems that people are used to feeling when driving their own cars. The buggy can also be controlled remotely, and in the future Nasa says this system can be expanded to allow for autonomous driving. 'While the vehicle as a whole is designed around operating in an urban environment, the core technologies are advancements used in many of our robotic systems and rovers,' said Mason. 'Actuators, motor controllers, sensors, batteries, BMS, component cooling, sealing, and software are all examples of technologies that are being devel oped and tested in MRV that will be used in next generation rover systems. 'The technologies developed in MRV have direct application in future manned vehicles undertaking missions on the surface of Earth's moon, on Mars, or even an asteroid. 'Additionally, MRV provides a platform to learn lessons that could drive the next generation of automobiles.",

        "article": "Rangers boss Stuart McCall insists it will not be a major disaster if his side are forced to play two extra games to reclaim their Premiership return. The Gers currently lead the way in the race for second spot in the Championship, with a one-point advantage over Hibernian and a six-point cushion separating them from Queen of the South. Finishing immediately behind newly-crowned champions Hearts would spare the Ibrox men the bother of two extra hazardous games in the play-offs, with the teams finishing third and fourth facing off over two legs before taking on the second tier's runners-up.\u00a0The winner of that tie then meets the Premiership's second-bottom side in a crucial winner-takes-all battle. Stuart McCall is relaxed about the prospect of Rangers finishing third in the Scottish Championship . But having stumbled to a 3-0 defeat against Queens and a 1-1 draw with basement side Livingston either side of Sunday's four-goal romp over Raith, there is no guarantee the Light Blues will see off Saturday's trip to Dumbarton without another slip-up. McCall, though, is ready to take whatever outcome is thrown his way. He said: 'At this moment second place is in our own hands. If you'd given me that a few weeks ago when I first came in, I'd have snapped your hands off for it. 'There were one or two people who thought we wouldn't even reach the play-offs. McCall faces the media on Friday ahead of Saturday's trip to Dumbarton as Rangers look to hold on to second . 'We've done that first part. Obviously we want to get second but Hibs and Queens want the same. 'You don't want to have to play the extra games but if you have to, you will. If you have to get through to the top league by playing six games then so be it. 'Of course it's important to us to finish second. But if we finish third or fourth that does not mean we won't get promotion. It's not the end of the world.' McCall was also happy to see a peaceful resolution reached after the row raised by the Scottish Professional Football League's messy meddling with the Championship fixture list. Rangers' final-day tie with Hearts at Tynecastle was pushed back 24 hours to Sunday, May 3, to accommodate Sky Sports. McCall joins in training on Friday as the Rangers boss prepares his side for Saturday's clash . But that left Hibs raging as having played their last game at Falkirk on the Saturday, they claimed McCall's team would be advantaged by the fact they would know the result required in Gorgie to claim second. Compromise was reached when Sky gave the league permission to switch the Hearts-Rangers tie back to its original May 2 slot. 'Everyone playing at the same time is fine and the right thing to do,' said McCall. But there could yet be more tinkering with the schedule to come. Hibs and Falkirk - who have yet to be counted out of the play-off chase - will battle for a place in the William Hill Scottish Cup final on Saturday, leaving the possibility that the second leg of the play-off final may have to be pushed back into June. Rangers dropped two points at Championship bottom side Livingston in their bid for promotion . The SPFL is expected to announce early next week if a change of date is required but Rangers are bracing themselves for an administrative nightmare, with 12 first-team members due to become free agents on June 1. McCall confirmed the club's five loanees from Newcastle are registered until June 9, and will be free to play whatever happens. But he admitted the club may have to hand short-term deals to their players to see them through to the re-arranged date. 'We won't think about it until it becomes a problem,' he said. 'But it will certainly need to be something that is looked at if that does become the case, as we have almost a dozen players whose contract will be up at the end of May.'",

        "article": "An engineer, who was sentenced to six months jail and 75 lashes after he was found with homemade alcohol in Saudi Arabia, has spoken of his frustration with the lack of help he received from the Australian embassy. Grandfather Peter Mutty, from Roseberry in Sydney's inner-west, was caught with two cartons of beer, one box of red wine and one box of white wine in his car on August 31 last year while driving home in Riyadh. The possession of alcohol is illegal in Saudi Arabia. Sydney grandfather Peter Mutty (pictured with his wife, Debbie, and grandchildren) has had a travel ban placed on him after he served time for alcohol possession, which is illegal in Saudi Arabia . While other expats who had committed the same crime in the past were deported, Mutty was ordered to serve jail time according to the Islamic calendar and received 28 of the 75 lashes he was sentenced to have. He said it was not unusual for a reduction in penalty as the point of it was to 'humiliate' a person. The 57-year-old was sent to Thoqba prison in the Al Khobar Eastern Province on October 19 and was released on March 19. He shared the same cell with two murderers, a rapist and thieves. But since he walked free, Mutty has been unable to leave Saudi Arabia or work as he has been banned from travelling out of the country without any explanation as to why this is happening . Mutty's situation has turned so desperate that he and his wife, Debbie, have reached out to family to help them by donating money. He was jailed for six months and 75 lashes, but only received 28. Mutty says he received little assistance from the Australian embassy in Saudi Arabia . The Sydney grandfather does not deny he committed the crime, but he has grown increasingly frustrated with the Australian embassy who he claims have not been taking his case seriously. 'The Australian embassy, who made contact late in the piece with the [Saudi Arabia's] Foreign Ministry, said I would not receive lashes but I did. The whole thing is a complete stuff-up,' Mutty told Daily Mail Australia. 'We don't care what the politics are, [we want them to] take this seriously. An Australian citizen is not being treated fairly.' Mutty said the embassy should have helped him try and find out which department had placed the travel ban on him. 'We don't know who put the travel ban in place. [It could have been] the police, the Department of Foreign Affairs, the office of public prosecution,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'And we can't focus on the right person to lift this travel ban. 'That\u2019s what we're expecting the Australian embassy in Riyadh to do for us. They have to be much more proactive.' Mutty has grown so frustrated with the situation that he has gone public to drum up awareness. 'My own embassy didn't stand up for me and finally we went to Australian media and the embassy has now decided to do something,' he said. After speaking out about his situation to the Australia media, Mutty was now receiving assistance from the embassy . When asked why he had run the risk of getting caught, Mutty answered frankly: 'Because you get complacent. I never thought I would get caught. 'The way life works here for expats is all of us live on compounds and those compounds are secure,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'If you know someone on other compounds, you go to their compound in your car. '[After a barbecue], you take some food and some nibbles and some alcohol [back home], and every time you run the risk. 'It's very unusual expats get stopped by the police here... [but] on this particular day, we got stopped.' Despite his brush with the law in Saudi Arabia, Mutty said he would be willing to return and work in the country. 'I would have no problem coming back to Saudi Arabia to work,' he said. 'I knew the laws of the country. I signed a document that I understood the laws and alcohol ban was listed, so in other words I knew what I was doing and getting myself into.' A spokesperson for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade told Daily Mail Australia tey had been providing Mr Mutty with consular assistance. 'The Australian Embassy in Riyadh has been providing Mr Mutty with consular assistance in line with the Consular Services Charter from the time he first made contact seeking assistance on 10 September 2014. 'That assistance, which continues, has included visits to him in prison, to ensure his health and welfare were being appropriately safeguarded, and official representations on his case to senior Saudi authorities,' the spokesperson said. 'The Embassy is in contact with Mr Mutty and his legal representative about having the current travel ban lifted so that he can depart Saudi Arabia.'",

        "article": "Those who wore it risked being called a 'mushroom head' by the less fashion forward at school but that hasn't prevented the bowl cut from making an unlikely comeback. The statement Nineties chop, made famous by Jim Carrey\u2019s Lloyd Christmas in Dumb And Dumber, has graced the heads of celebrities far and wide in recent years - from Rihanna and Robert Pattinson to Lena Dunham and Miley Cyrus - and is spreading like wildfire among hipsters. One chain of British barber shops has reported a whopping 200 per cent surge in requests for the almost universally unflattering cut, with men queuing around the corner for their turn to get the snip. The statement 90s chop, made famous by by Jim Carrey\u2019s Lloyd Christmas in Dumb and Dumber (right), has graced the heads of celebrities far and wide in recent years, including Robert Pattinson (left) 'We have been really surprised by the popularity of the bowl cut,' admits Headcase director Martin Nobbs. 'We\u2019ve even had women coming into the barbers asking for the traditionally male style. It\u2019s fast becoming the 2015 hipster trend.' The craze may have been fuelled in part by the release of Dumb And Dumber To, the recent sequel to the 1994 cult hit, in which Jim Carrey hung on to his character's trademark chop. Indeed, Twilight heartthrob Rob Pattinson surprised everyone last November when he adopted the bowl cut, the same month the film came out. Members of the public take the plunge and opt for a bowl haircut . Headcase Barbers (pictured) has tipped the style as a must-have look for summer 2015 . Girls star Lena Dunham drew a similar gasp from commentators last year when she unveiled her own platinum blonde version on Instagram, stating: 'Change is good.' Miley Cyrus has also enjoyed a brief flirtation with the bowl cut, hers being eerily similar in nature to the one sported by Backstreet Boys' Nick Carter back in the Nineties, when Miley was just a child. And who could forget Justin Bieber, who burst onto the scene in 2007 with a sweepy bowl cut so beloved by his fans that he broke hearts around the world when he later chopped it off. Other brave stars to have tried the style on for size over the years include Rihanna, Kelis, Jessie J, Agnes Deyn and Kelly Osbourne. What's more, says Mr Nobbs, another Nineties style is also becoming increasingly popular, although 'the classic curtains style' still has some way to go before it hits the heights of the bowl cut. 'We've seen a bit of a resurgence from that Nineties style as well,' he explains. 'The classic curtains have been spotted recently on the likes of Liam Hemsworth, Zayn Malik and Johnny Depp as well.' Lena Dunham surprised her fans last year when she unveiled her own platinum blonde version on Instagram, stating, 'Change is good' Agyness Deyn was famed for her raven version \u00a0in 2010 . Rihanna added a dash of dark to her blonde bowl cut in 2010 . Jessie J went for a very blunt version in early 2014 and American Boy singer Estelle added a red tint to hers . Miley Cyrus is never one to shy away from a bold new look, pictured in August 2014 . Kelis glammed up her bowl cut with gold accessories in 2008 . Nick Carter had one of the original 90s bowl cuts in 1997 . Style icon Kelly Osbourne wore a bowl cut for years, including here in 2005 . Justin Bieber spawned thousands of bowl cut copycats when he first found fame, seen here with the style in 2010 . Johnny Depp and Zayn Malik have both been spotted out and about with curtains .

        "article": "Chelsea took a giant step towards the Premier League title with a hard-fought 1-0 victory against Manchester United. Eden Hazard's sublime strike in the 38th minute proved crucial as Jose Mourinho's side extended their lead at the top of the standings. Here, Sportsmail's Oliver Todd rates the players' performances at Stamford Bridge. Branislav Ivanovic had a tough afternoon marking\u00a0Marouane Fellaini (left) but he did well in the air throughout . CHELSEA (4-2-3-1) THIBAUT COURTOIS 6 - While United dominated, not much to do. Almost slipped up when he dropped a difficult cross. BRANISLAV IVANOVIC 6- Tough afternoon trying to get close to Fellaini but did well every time the ball came into the box in the air. Booked. GARY CAHILL 6.5 - Vital block from Falcao at close range. Almost ruined the whole effort with late tackle on Herrera that could have been a penalty. JOHN TERRY 7 - Strong up against Falcao and gave the striker no room to manoeuvre. Marshalled a backline that held its nerve. Cesc Fabregas (right) had a quiet afternoon for Jose Mourinho's side . CESAR AZPILICUETA 6 -\u00a0Little to do down the left as United focused on the other flank, almost set up Hazard for a second. KURT ZOUMA 5.5 - Outplayed in midfield as United took early initiative and couldn\u2019t get into the game. Mourinho will say he did his job. NEMANJA MATIC 7 - Back at his commanding best in second half after poor opening period. Coped well against Fellaini. OSCAR 8 - Brilliant back-heeled assist for the goal. Struggled from the start but grew into the game and proved decisive at both ends. Booked. Oscar puts in a strong tackle on United defender\u00a0Paddy McNair during the first-half . CESC FABREGAS 6 - Better with the ball than without it and as United dominated possession he found game passing him by. EDEN HAZARD 8.5 - Made the difference in a big game again. Constant outlet for Chelsea midfield and slotted between De Gea\u2019s legs for goal. Eden Hazard fires through David De Gea's legs for the decisive goal in the first-half at Stamford Bridge . DIDIER DROGBA 5 -Worked hard but that lost yard of pace cost him a lot of the time. Running battles with Smalling and McNair. Booked. SUBS . RAMIRES (67, for OSCAR) 6 - Came on to act as a runner from midfield but didn\u2019t really work as planned. JOHN OBI MIKEL (90, for FABREGAS) WILLIAN (90, for HAZARD) Veteran forward Didier Drogba worked hard against United but has lost a yard of pace . MANAGER: JOSE MOURINHO 7 - It wasn\u2019t pretty but he found a way to stop United, a task which many others have tried and failed with in recent weeks. Unused subs: Cech, Luis, Cuadrado, Solanke. De Gea did not have the busiest day in London but could have been sent off for handling outside the box . MANCHESTER UNITED (4-3-3) DAVID DE GEA 6.5 - Little to do as Chelsea were happy to wait for their opportunities. Could have been sent off for handling outside the box. ANTONIO VALENCIA 6 - Strong up against Hazard but it\u2019s very difficult to stop the Player of the Year certainty in this kind of mood. CHRIS SMALLING 6.5 - The senior centre back, looked calm and continued his recent good form under Van Gaal\u2019s guidance. United left back Luke Shaw (right) tussles with Chelsea midfielder\u00a0Nemanja Matic . PADDY MCNAIR 6.5 - Given plenty of room and was allowed to play out from the back. Twice tested Courtois from distance. LUKE SHAW 7 - Great penetrative work early on and his cut-back should have set up Rooney for an opener. Every bit as penetrative as Blind. WAYNE ROONEY 6 - Back in midfield, and it blunted his influence. Missed an excellent chance in the opening exchanges and should have scored. ANDER HERRERA 7.5 - Dictated from deep, excellent as United took initiative. Booked for diving in stoppage time as he hooked his leg on Cahill's. Wayne Rooney's attacking influence was blunted by his midfield role against Chelsea . MAROUANE FELLAINI 6.5 - Always a presence but Chelsea doubled up on United\u2019s unorthodox dangerman to stop the threat. JUAN MATA 5 - Set-piece delivery rarely found its intended target and game passed him by a little as United focused attacks down the left. RADAMEL FALCAO 4 - Bullied out of the game by Terry.

The game was marked by a strong performance from Chelsea's defense, which held firm against United's attacks, and a dominant display from midfielder Nemanja Matic. For United, Ander Herrera was impressive in midfield, but the team's attacking threat was blunted by Chelsea's well-organized defense.

        "article": "Ol Pejeta Conservancy, Kenya (CNN)At first glance, Sudan looks like any other northern white rhino: stout and agile, with square lips. He grazes under the hot sun, his massive head lowered to the ground,  at  the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in central Kenya. When he's not wallowing in his enclosure, he waddles around the sprawling savannah, stopping briefly to drink water from a concrete hole. But Sudan is not just any rhino. He's the last known male northern white rhino left in the entire world. For an animal on the verge of extinction, the fate of the subspecies rests on his ability to conceive with the two female northern white rhinos at the conservancy. Sudan's female companions,  Fatu and Najin, live at the conservancy, where experts are scrambling to ensure the subspecies does not go extinct. The animals are under 24-hour protection by armed guards. Rhinos are targeted by poachers, fueled by the belief in Asia that their horns cure various ailments. Experts say the rhino horn is becoming more lucrative than drugs. In addition to round-the-clock security, the conservancy has put radio transmitters on the animals and dispatches incognito rangers into neighboring communities to gather intelligence on poaching. The conservancy is also raising funds to help equip and train rangers who guard the rhinos. At 42, Sudan is elderly in rhino years. Fatu, 15, is a spring chicken, while Najin is 25. Though the three northern white rhinos are physiologically healthy, age might be a factor, says George Paul, the deputy veterinarian at the conservancy. \"Sudan is currently old and may not be able to naturally mount and mate with a female,\" he says. In addition, he has a low sperm count, which complicates natural and scientific efforts, experts say. Najin could conceive, but her hind legs are so weak, she may be unable to support a mounted male. \"There has been recorded mating between different pairs over the last few years, but not conceptions,\" Paul says. \"Based on  a recent health examination conducted, both animals have a regular estrus cycle, but no conception has been recorded.\" And if one is not recorded soon, the beloved animal will go extinct. Rhinos on a plane: Life-saving mission across borders . In a race against time, international experts are resorting to science to try to sustain the subspecies. The northern white rhino cannot mate with a black rhino, but there is a chance it could mate with a southern white rhino, Paul says. While southern white rhinos are not endangered --  Ol Pejeta has 19 -- they are a different subspecies  from the northern white rhino genetically. Though the offspring would not be 100% northern white rhino, it would be better than nothing, experts say. A committee at the conservancy is also looking at various alternative reproduction techniques, including in vitro fertilization. \"In other countries, success has been achieved with embryo transfer in a different rhino species, thus that, as a technique, can be presupposed to be the most promising,\" Paul says. \"However, consultations are ongoing amongst different reproductive technique experts on the way forward.\" Bringing rhinos back to Uganda, one calf at a time . The need to preserve the northern white rhino is dire. \"Realistically, we are looking at these animals dying in the next decade or so. But hopefully, using artificial methods of reproduction, we might be able to bring them back in the future,\" Paul says. \"This might mean that it will happen when the current animals are already deceased, but it could happen.\" The conservancy acquired the northern white rhinos --  two males and two females -- in 2009 from a zoo in the Czech Republic. Suni, the other male northern white rhino at the conservancy, died last year. In another incident, another male, Angalifu, died at the San Diego Zoo last year, bringing the subspecies closer to extinction. There are no known northern white rhinos left in the wild. A total of five remain in captivity worldwide: three in Kenya,  and one each at zoos in San Diego and the Czech Republic. But Sudan, a male, is in a company of one. 11 wildlife experiences that could vanish in your lifetime .",

Second-placed Real, who hammered Granada 9-1 on Sunday with Portugal forward Cristiano Ronaldo netting his first five-goal haul, are four points behind Barca, who host Almeria earlier on Wednesday, with nine games left. Barring last-minute injuries, Ancelotti will have both Isco and James Rodriguez available for the first time in two months since James broke a bone in his foot and must decide which of the two playmakers joins Toni Kroos and Luka Modric across the centre. Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti faces a selection dilemma ahead of Wednesday's match with Rayo . Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals in Real Madrid's 9-1 rout of Granada on Sunday . Ronaldo's five-star performance is hailed in the Monday edition of the Spanish sports daily AS . 'The man in the bag' ran the headline on the front cover of Monday's edition of Marca . Real Madrid are four points behind Barcelona in the race for the La Liga title . Isco, a Spain international who was suspended for the Granada game, performed well first during Modric's lengthy injury lay-off and then during the absence of James and has become a huge favourite with the Real fans. Ancelotti, by contrast, has been whistled by some sections of the Bernabeu crowd as Real stumbled since the turn of the year and if he drops Isco and the team stutter again the Italian could be in for a torrid time. James returned to action against Granada and Ancelotti praised him after the game, suggesting he favours the Colombian, who joined from Monaco for a fee of \u00a363m in the close season. James Rodriguez returned to the Real Madrid team during the match with Granada after two months out . Isco (left), seen here with Luka Modric in training last week, is also set to return to action soon . 'He played very well, it didn't look as though he hadn't played for two months,' Ancelotti said. 'He showed his quality, his intensity and his ability to keep possession. He is a very direct player and always shows great vision and awareness.' After edging Celta Vigo 1-0 on Sunday, Barca will be looking for a more convincing performance at home to struggling Almeria, who sacked coach Juan Ignacio Martinez after Saturday's 4-1 home defeat by Levante. Barca's Argentina forward Lionel Messi, in particular, will be keen to get back among the goals after failing to score in his last three outings in all competitions. Ronaldo leapfrogged Messi to the top of La Liga's scoring chart with Sunday's five and has 36, with Messi, who holds the record for a single season of 50, on 32.

The 72-year-old, who had worked at Bayern for almost 40 years, sensationally quit the Bundesliga club, claiming 'the bond of trust is damaged', but Guardiola has played down claims of a feud. 'The reaction is on me, I was disappointed,' he told reporters in the wake of a shock Champions League quarter-final defeat by Porto. 'It was nothing to do with the doctor.

Guardiola also appeared to publicly humiliate Muller-Wohlfahrt eight days before his exit from the club, sarcastically clapping him when Benatia left the pitch injured. Continuing at his press conference on Thursday, Guardiola said: 'The responsibility for the defeat in Porto lies with me. Put together, my players have had 30 operations over the last two years, but we've still won the league and cup. 'We can't win every match 3-0 or 4-0 in this situation. It's impossible.'

        "article": "Teachers complained they are now expected to be 'frontline stormtroppers' in the fight against Islamist extremism in school, a conference has heard. They said they are now being forced to spy on children during sensitive discussions as a result of new-counter terrorism rules. The National Union of Teachers (NUT) suggested that Government strategies designed to tackle extremism and terrorism have instead 'shut down debate' in schools. Teachers said they now feel nervous discussing controversial issues over fears they will be pressured to report youngsters who share their opinions. They also claimed young people  feel unable to express there views on certain subjects, such as the Charlie Hebdo killings, for fear of being branded an extremist. Scroll down for video . Christine Blower, NUT general secretary, said there is a need keep a 'safe space' for discussion . Jan Nielsen, an NUT member from Wandsworth, south-west London, said: 'We have to be clear that we are being put in the position where we are really being expected to be the frontline stormtroopers, who listen, who spy, and notify the authorities about students that we may be suspicious of.' The conference heard an example of a student being pulled aside after prayers one Friday because children coming out of the prayer room were talking about extremism, despite the fact that the boy had put a strong argument against joining jihadi groups. In another case, a boy who applied to go to Pakistan to visit his dying grandfather had his laptop taken from him and searched, with three potential examples of the youngster viewing jihadi websites found. When the pupil was questioned, he asked how he could argue against something if he did not understand it. In response, the pupil's non-Muslim classmates questioned why they would not be seen as suspicious if they applied to visit their grandparents in Holland, the conference was told. Delegates at the annual conference in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, raised concerns about the move to require schools to promote fundamental British values as well as the Government's Prevent strategy, which is aimed at tackling extremism. The strategy suggests school staff can help to identify and refer youngsters whose behaviour suggests that they are being drawn into extremism or terrorism. Alex Kenny, of the union's executive, described Prevent as a 'blunt instrument that will do damage and inhibit debate in schools', adding that Ofsted should be allowed 'nowhere near these issues'. Ofsted now checks that schools are actively promoting British values like tolerance and democracy as part of regular inspections. In the wake of attacks on the Charlie Hebdo journalists there were, in some schools, Muslim pupils who did not feel they could say they were offended by the newspapers cartoons . Mr Kenny said: 'We live in a damaged and volatile world, and like us, young people are trying to make sense of it, like us, they're trying to come to conclusions about cause, effect and solutions, and like us they want a space to discuss it. 'Schools are places where that discussion, on ethical and political issues should take place, in an environment of enquiry, and it may be an environment where young people say things we don't like, or say things that concern us that we want to address with them, that we want to discuss with them. 'But Prevent conflates a notion of British values and an elastic notion of non-violent extremism that is shutting down that debate.' He added: 'We have measures to deal with safeguarding, we have child protection measures, we don't need Prevent and we don't need to involve the police as the first instance. 'We are hearing young people telling teachers that they don't want to discuss things, that they don't want to discuss what happened with the Charlie Hebdo shootings, young people who were offended by the Charlie Hebdo cartoons, but saying they don't want to say it in class, they don't want to say it in schools. The conference heard that Prevent was shutting down debate in schools . 'Prevent is shutting down debate and we must oppose it and we must say schools are places where children and teachers should be allowed to discuss these issues.' To loud applause, delegates passed a resolution which includes an amendment calling on conference to confirm it believes 'that schools should be places where young people can discuss events in a spirit of enquiry and openness, and that teachers are well-placed to facilitate such discussions and deal with the expression of unacceptable viewpoints'. A Conservative spokesman said: 'Teaching about the fundamental British values of democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty and tolerance and respect for others is part of our promotion of British values, and is at the heart of what every school has to deliver for children. 'We want all schools to promote these values throughout the curriculum, not just as a bulwark against extremism, but as a vital part of preparing young people to get on in life.' He added: 'Our guidance makes it clear that no teacher or school leader should feel unable to talk about difficult or sensitive issues - indeed teaching about fundamental British values actively encourages such discussions - but no-one should be using a school to promote views, opinions or beliefs that discriminate against other people on the basis of their background.'",

After starting the new Formula One season in Australia with a severe lack of pace, McLaren and new power-unit supplier Honda made significant progress a fortnight later in Malaysia. Although both Button and team-mate Fernando Alonso retired during the race at the Sepang International Circuit, the duo at least discovered the car was competitive alongside other midfield runners. Jenson Button looks on in the garage during final practice for last month's Malaysian Grand Prix . That came as a pleasant surprise to Button, who is now hoping further steps have been taken going into this weekend's race in Shanghai. 'Obviously we want to finish a race, but seeing improvement in pace was much more important,' said Button. 'Yes, we both had failures, but I'd rather that with us pushing and trying to get more power out of the car than trotting around at the back and simply getting to the end. 'To be able to race other cars, and see the Red Bulls until a long way into the race, was good. 'We would probably have been 20 seconds behind them. I know they're not quick, but that is a good step forward for us. Button returns to the McLaren garage after retiring during the race at the Sepang circuit . 'Right now we're comparing ourselves with the Force Indias, Saubers and Lotuses. 'We were quicker than Force India; the Sauber was on the same sort of pace, and the Lotus wasn't that much quicker. 'Fighting with the pack is important for me. It's what I enjoy and hopefully race by race we'll start picking them off.' Despite the positives, Button acknowledges the entire team, including Honda, 'still has a long way to go'. British driver Button in action before he retired from the Malaysian Grand Prix . Button added: 'We need and want more downforce to fight with the guys around us, and we still have a lot to do with the power unit, but our basic car is good. 'If you look at our high-speed pace, compared to the Force India and Sauber, then we are much stronger. 'So we're moving in the right direction, and I'm already surprised we are racing cars.

McLaren driver Fernando Alonso (left) drives ahead of team-mate Button in Kuala Lumpur . Button appreciates the cooler air in Shanghai could have an effect. The 35-year-old said: 'There is a feeling the expected cooler weather will make it harder to generate tyre temperature.

'But there is definitely progress being made, and it's great to be able to play a role in helping move the whole team forwards.

Indeed the 26-year-old has amassed so many during her 17-year hobby, she now holds the Guinness World Record for the largest collection of Pokemon items, having 25,000 of them spread around the home she shares with her mother, Sharon. 'I just love Pokemon so much - there's just something about it that brings joy to me every day,' said Lisa. Her fixation with the Japanese characters started at the age of nine when she saw a picture of the cartoon's protagonist, Pikachu in a Nintendo magazine. Her collection of the Nintendo franchise has grown so large that her mother  had to move from the largest to the smallest room in their house to make room for her vast array of\u00a0cuddly toys, models, clothing, badges, flannels and posters. Lisa clinched the Guinness World Record for the largest collection of Pokemon memorabilia in 2009 when she had 12,113 items, but that hasn't stopped her from collecting more.

'The first toy I ever got was a large Psyduck plush toy from Japan - my mother and grandmother ordered it from a mail order company before Pokemon hit the UK,' she said. 'We had to guess what we were ordering because the names of the Pokemon hadn't even been translated into English yet.'

        "article": "The first double hundred of Alex Hales' career helped Nottinghamshire into a position of strength on the opening day of their LV= County Championship match against Yorkshire at Trent Bridge. The England international was unbeaten on 222 not out as the home side reached 393 for seven by stumps, having been invited to bat first. Hales scored his runs from 250 balls, with 37 fours and a six and having shared in a third wicket stand of 171 with James Taylor, who scored 59. Steven Patterson, with two for 58 and Jack Brooks, two for 90, returned the leading figures for the Yorkshire bowlers on a tough day for the defending Champions. Alex Hales, pictured in action for Nottinghamshire earlier this month, completed a double century on Sunday . Hales' passed three figures for the 10th time in his career, spoiling the return of Andrew Gale, back skippering Yorkshire again after serving a four match suspension. Gale rotated all seven bowlers at his disposal but all found it difficult to put the brake on Hales' scoring. In general, too much width was offered to the 26-year-old and he capitalised fully to reach his century from 131 balls and his 150 from 173. Taylor was a perfect foil for his World Cup team-mate, content to play the supportive role in reaching his own 50 from 89 balls, with nine fours.Yorkshire's spirits\u00a0were lifted just before the tea interval when Brooks struck twice in an over, snaring Taylor with an lbw decision and then providing enough temptation for Samit Patel to nudge one into the hands of Alex Lees at first slip. Riki Wessels made 18 before falling just before the taking of the second new ball, guiding Nottingham-born Will Rhodes to second slip. Hales, in action during an England nets session in Australia in March, hasn't given up on playing Test cricket . Hales went past his previous best of 184, made against Somerset in 2011, and then had his only two scares of the day, against the bowling of Patterson. An uppish chip to mid-on was totally missed by Rhodes, who claimed he lost the flight of the ball. On 197 a huge shout for lbw was turned down by umpire Russell Evans, to the dismay of the entire fielding unit. A four off Bresnan eased home nerves, though, and a standing ovation was duly afforded Hales for reaching the 200 landmark from 234 deliveries. He will return on the second morning, after the final over of the day was cut short following the dismissal of Will Gidman, also caught in the slip cordon, off Patterson. Nottinghamshire's openers both made 27 before the visiting attack struck twice during the morning session. Steven Mullaney was given out lbw to Patterson, beaten by one that came back and missed the inside edge. Brendan Taylor, who had scored centuries in both of his first class appearances this season, became a notable first scalp for Matthew Fisher, who at 17 years 161 days is Yorkshire's sixth youngest debutant, but it mattered little once Hales got to work. Hales hopes his brilliant knock against Yorkshire sends a message to the England selectors . Hales said: 'It's a very proud day for me to make that score against the county champions and against a very good attack. 'I'm very pleased with how the day has gone, it has been one of those days where all the shots I've tried have come off. 'They bowled pretty well at me in the morning session but I knew if I got through it, it would become easier and I'd be all right.' Asked if his knock had sent any sort of message to the England selectors, he added: 'I hope to show that I can make scores in all three formats. 'This year I want to make as many big scores as I can in this format because it's still my dream to play Test cricket.' Yorkshire captain Gale said: 'We weren't at our best today but fair play to Alex Hales. 'I thought he played really well - a chanceless innings really - but we only bowled to 60 or 70 per cent of our potential.

        "article": "The UK's top prosecutor today told critics deriding her decision not to prosecute Lord Janner over alleged child sex offences to challenge her in court. Alison Saunders, the Director of Public Prosecutions, said she was 'not afraid' of a legal challenge because she is convinced the Labour peer is not fit to plead because of his dementia. And in her first interview since she announced Lord Janner would not face trial she refused to quit because 'making the right decision is not a resigning issue'. Fighting back:\u00a0Alison Saunders, the Director of Public Prosecutions, said she was 'not afraid' of a legal challenge over her decision not to charge Lord Janner and said she would not quit . Victims and leading politicians have accused her of 'damaging public confidence' in the justice system with her ruling \u2013 even though there was a enough evidence to go ahead with a prosecution. Mrs Saunders admitted herself that three investigations into claims made by 25 alleged victims over 25 years were botched \u00a0- but decided it was now too late to charge him. She told the\u00a0Evening Standard today: 'If somebody wants to challenge my decision I'm not afraid. The proper way to challenge it is through the right to review or a judicial review. 'I'm confident that if they want to do that my decision will stand up. I thought long and hard before making it and I'm confident I got it right. My job is not to be populist. 'The medical evidence was very clear. He wouldn't be fit to stand trial, he wouldn't understand the questions, he wouldn't understand the process, he wouldn't be able to understand instructions. 'It's not to make decisions on the basis of what people want. It's about making the right decisions. Sometimes that means it won't be popular but if I'm fulfilling my duties as DPP that's the right thing to do.' Police began investigating Lord Janner, pictured, after allegations of historic child-sex abuse were made but now he is too ill to be put on trial . Last night it emerged Mrs Saunders overruled the advice of two of the country's most senior barristers to allow Lord Janner to avoid a trial. Clare Montgomery QC and child abuse expert Eleanor Laws QC, leading counsel to the investigation, offered advice which could have supported a move to prosecute. In particular, Mrs Laws pointed to overwhelming evidence and corroborating accounts by victims during the two-year police inquiry. But Mrs Saunders decided it was not in the public interest to put Lord Janner in the dock due to his Alzheimer's disease. Campaigners, MPs and victims believe a 'trial of the facts' could have satisfied the need to get to the bottom of the appalling claims against the peer, whatever his mental state. And MailOnline revealed last week that 19 dementia sufferers have been prosecuted for child sex offences and ten were in the past year. The Mail revealed today that Lord Janner signed over the deeds of his \u00a32million home to his children at the height of the police paedophile case against him, it can be revealed. The move puts his luxury apartment potentially out of reach of child abuse victims suing the Labour peer for compensation. The flat, in an exclusive gated community near Hampstead Heath, North London, was transferred free of charge to his two daughters and son in March last year - the same month police raided Janner's Westminster office and three months after they had swooped on his home. In the four years after he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 2009, the former Labour MP, 86, has claimed more than \u00a3100,000 in parliamentary expenses and allowances. Lord Janner signed over the deeds of his \u00a32 million flat in this complex to his children after the police raid . Even earlier this month, on April 9, he was fit enough to sign a letter saying he wanted to remain in the House of Lords. A week later, the Crown Prosecution Service announced Janner would not be tried over child sex allegations because he was suffering so much from Alzheimer's that he could not even understand any charges against him, let alone answer them. This was despite the fact the CPS ruled there was enough evidence to charge him with 22 sexual offences against children dating from 1969 to 1988. Victims have accused bungling authorities of helping to cover up the crimes of a once powerful man and destroying any hope they had of justice. Child protection campaigners, MPs, police and victims have vowed to challenge the decision in the courts. Last night, two senior Government figures joined the chorus of disapproval and said concerns over the decision were justified. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said there was something 'very strange' about the ruling and Health Minister Norman Lamb said the authorities should examine precedents of dementia sufferers being brought to trial. He added that the matter should be brought before a court because Mrs Saunders and the Crown Prosecution Service had made 'heinous errors by failing to bring a prosecution earlier when there was evidence there to do so'. Last seen: Channel 4 News filmed Lord Jenner outside his house in London on July\u00a08 2014, when he was last seen in public . Signed: Dementia sufferer Lord Janner signed a letter on April 9, just a week after he was deemed unfit to stand trial. His signature has been redacted for privacy reasons . Mr Hunt said London Mayor Boris Johnson and Home Secretary Theresa May had been 'right' to express concern at the decision, adding: 'I think we all think that there is something very, very strange here where someone was signing official letters only a matter of weeks ago and is somehow escaping prosecution for something so incredibly serious.' Lord Carlile, a Lib Dem peer and legal expert, said although there was strong evidence Lord Janner had dementia, the decision not to proceed with legal action should be reconsidered. This week, leading politicians from seven parties demanded the decision be reversed. The group, led by Labour's Simon Danczuk, wrote to The Times: 'As long as justice is not seen to be done and the greater public interest is not served, the public will see attempts to investigate establishment figures involved in historic child abuse as a whitewash.' A CPS spokesman confirmed Mrs Laws advised Mrs Saunders to prosecute and that Mrs Montgomery was consulted on an 'ancillary matter'. At least ten men with dementia have been convicted of child sex offences since 2010. Clare Montgomery QC, right and Eleanor Laws QC, left, both recommended Janner should face trial .",

A terrible run of form has seen City slip down into fourth place, their 4-2 loss to rivals Manchester United leaving Manuel Pellegrini's side well adrift of leaders Chelsea and now in a battle to stay ahead of Liverpool in the race for Champions League qualification. However, West Ham are also in need of some consistency, with a stoppage-time goal conceded at home to Stoke denying them what would have been only a third league win of 2015. West Ham manager Sam Allardyce will hope for a strong end to the season, but it has threatened to tail off . Allardyce  reacts on the touchline during the Hammers' match with Stoke City at Upton Park last weekend . 'I am more concerned about getting the best out of my team,' said Allardyce, whose side are now in 10th place, having once looked set for a European qualification challenge themselves. 'Maybe City are a wounded animal and they might come out all guns blazing or they might be tentative. We won't know until the match starts. 'We are expecting them to put in a determined performance in front of their own fans.' Allardyce added: 'The motivation for our players should be that they have let themselves down by not achieving the results that they should have done from the positions we have been in. 'We want to get the feel-good factor back by winning a few games and getting the confidence back up.' Allardyce believes the Irons can yet go on to secure their best finish since winning promotion back to the top flight. 'At the moment we want to reach the 50-point mark or higher, that will make sure we finish higher than we have done in the three years we have been back,' he said. Enner Valencia (left) is expected to return at the Etihad Stadium, but a thigh strain has ruled out Diafra Sakho . West Ham will be without Senegal forward Diafra Sakho because of a thigh strain, but Enner Valencia has recovered from a foot problem and so will lead the front line alongside veteran striker Carlton Cole. Allardyce said: 'Those two guys have to perform to the very best and find the goals we need to try to win the game. 'Playing at our top level is our aim on Sunday. Whether that gets us the result or not we will have to wait and see based on the quality of the opposition we are against, because when you play Manchester City all of your players have to be on top form in all areas. 'If our lads have their shooting boots on, which we need, then you never know.'",

A self-warming bottle that heats up in 60 seconds is among the latest gizmos designed to make new mums' lives easier. While muslin squares and cotton wool have been go-to products for mums for generations, gadgets on the market in 2015 include a machine that makes 'shushing' sounds to 'break the cycle of crying' and biodegradable nappies which don't clog up landfill. Scroll down for video . The new royal baby could be clad in eco-friendly biodegradable mull-cloth as opposed to disposable nappies . Pippa Middleton, left, is said to have bought the biodegradable nappies for her new royal niece or nephew . Pippa Middleton is among those embracing eco-friendly nappies and is said to have invested in \u00a34-a-piece mull-cloth nappies for her sister the Duchess of Cambridge ahead of the birth of the new royal baby. Shoppers in Geneva, Switzerland, have reported seeing Pippa buying the nappies, which are made of natural fibres and are popular in Europe. While re-usable and biodegradable nappies are easier on the planet and will no doubt get Prince Charles' seal of approval there is also a wealth of products to make parenthood easier - whether you're royal or not. Yoomi's self-warming baby bottle promises to gently warm a baby's feed to the natural temperature of breast milk in just 60 seconds, meaning there's no need for Wills to even get out of bed when helping with night-time feeds. And if they're having trouble settling the baby and need to resort to the pushchair the royal couple can pace around the grounds of Kensington Palace in safety thanks to Buggi Lights flashing ladybirds, which clip on to the pushchair's chassis and come with\u00a0white forward facing and red rear facing flashing lights - just like a car. There's no need to get cold hands while trying to get the baby to sleep either: Mummy Mitts attach to the handle bars of the pushchair, meaning you can take your hands out while the mittens remain attached. Headlights for the pushchair and a baby 'shusher' are among the latest gadgets for mums... ...or why not try mittens that attached to the pushchair or a giraffe to rock the crib? Koo-di's spout protector is also among the list of products you never knew you needed, stopping\u00a0baby touching hot bath taps and protecting against bumps, with heat spots that change colour to indicate temperature. When it comes to bedtime the Baby Shusher puts an end to pacing round the living room for hours on end: with rhymic 'shush' sounds the device can be programmed to make 15 minutes or 30 minutes of continuous shushing. And if that doesn't work patent-pending Gerry the Giraffe attaches to car seat, cribs and baby bouncers to rock the baby for up to 30 minutes - just enough time to get your nails done. But if baby isn't sleeping because they're poorly look no further than the Spilly Spoon, a non-spill medicine spoon which promises to administer medicine without spilling it first. A self-warming bottle and a spout protector are other gadgets on offer . The Spilly Spoon is designed to look like a caterpillar and administer medicine without spilling it . 'There's a mind-boggling array of infant devices on the market, but just because something exists doesn't mean that anyone actually needs\u00a0it,' Justine Roberts, CEO of parenting website Mumsnet, told MailOnline. 'For first time parents, it's almost impossible to predict which baby products will turn out to be essentials and which will gather dust in the cupboard. Feeding: muslin squares . Sleeping: Moses basket . Clothing: Babygros, scratch mittens . Medicine: Gripe water, Calpol . Toys: Fisher Price Chatter Telephone . 'One family will find that a multi-purpose travel system fits in perfectly with their needs; another may realise that all they need for transport is a sling.' And what would Sister Julienne, Call the Midwife's profoundly practical chief midwife - or your Granny - have to say? While there's no doubt many of today's modern gadgets can make life easy for new parents, when it comes to babies there are some things which have transcended time. Muslin squares, scratch mittens and Babygros still feature on 'must have' hospital bag lists, and many new mums come home from hospital and place their bundles of joy in Moses baskets. 'Our users also find that talking to other parents - about what you do and don't need to buy, how to budget, and the realities of day-to-day finances with an extra mouth to feed - is priceless,' says Mumnet's Roberts.",

        "article": "An explorer who plans to spend a year living inside a ball-shaped capsule on top of an iceberg is seeking funding for his daring project. Italian Alex Bellini is to be subjected to the full force of the iceberg as it melts, cracks and even flips - while hopefully staying safe inside his small spherical cabin. The aim of the cabin fever-inducing stunt is to highlight how global warming will melt icebergs around the world and cause sea levels to rise. Scroll down for video . Italian Alex Bellini will live atop an iceberg in Greenland starting next year. He will live inside a contained ball (artist's illustration shown), with no means to escape for 12 months. The capsule will be 10ft (three metres) wide and could fit 10 people - but Mr Bellini will remove all of the seats apart from one, for himself . Mr Bellini, 36, is seeking funding for his project, called\u00a0Adrift, which he hopes to begin in November 2016. Previous feats by the explorer include running more than 14,000 miles (22,500km), rowing more than 21,000 miles (34,000km) and spending 560 days in isolation. He has rowed both the Atlantic and Pacific and insists he favours challenges where there is a perceived lack of control. The capsules, initially designed essentially as escape pods for areas at risk of tsunami, can hold from two to ten people and range in price from \u00a38,000 to \u00a313,500 ($12,000 to $20,000). Four are currently in use in Japan, while two are in the US. Mr Bellini will use one at the upper scale, 10ft (three metres) wide - although he\u2019ll remove all the seats except one for himself. Inside he\u2019ll have exercise equipment, such as a stationary bike, in addition to supplies for the year such as food and water. But his latest venture represents a whole new challenge as he will have to deal with intense isolation and undergo serious psychological tests as he copes with being alone for 12 months. Perched on top of an iceberg in North West Greenland, he will be alone and unable to leave the capsule, leaving him vulnerable to whatever is in store - on the iceberg, or in his cabin. Comparable feats of endurance, such as the Solar Impulse mission, have also seen people remain in isolation for days, but Mr Bellini will have to cope for a whole 365 by himself. In addition to his mental health, he'll also workout on board to stay in good physical shape. A natural lighting system will maintain his circadian rhythm, while he'll be writing to keep himself entertained - in addition to reading books on psychology. His goal is to see an iceberg \u2018in the last phase of its long life,\u2019 observing the changes that occur as it melts into the ocean. 'This adventure is about waiting for something to happen,' Mr Bellini told Outside Online. 'But I knew since the beginning I needed to minimise the risk. \u2018An iceberg can flip over, and those events can be catastrophic.' His mobile home will be designed by aeronautical engineer Julian Sharpe, founder of Survival Capsule, whose creations were originally intended to be used in disaster zones such as areas vulnerable to tsunamis. But the indestructible and lightweight design appealed to Mr Bellini, and he now plans to use one for his own project. The capsule is also buoyant, so if he somehow finds himself in the sea, he will be able to float until he is rescued. Mr Bellini (pictured left), 36, is currently seeking funding for his project, called Adrift , which he hopes to begin in November 2016 near Greenland (right).\u00a0His goal is to see an iceberg \u2018in the last phase of its long life,\u2019 observing the changes that occur as it melts into the ocean . One of the most intriguing features of the capsule is that the entire interior can be mounted on roller balls and rotate, even if the exterior is tossed and turned. On an iceberg, this might prove vital. As an iceberg melts, its centre of mass can change dramatically until, in a matter of seconds, the whole thing flips over. Mr Bellini\u2019s plan is to place his capsule on top of an iceberg and stay there but, if the iceberg were to flip, he could quite suddenly find his capsule thrown into the air. If the interior was on roller balls, though, this could alleviate some of the sudden movements. He also plans to use sensors to detect tremors in the iceberg, suggesting it might be about to flip, so he can get himself into a safe bracing position.

        "article": "Marseille, France (CNN)Initial tests on the flight data recorder recovered from downed Germanwings Flight 9525 show that co-pilot Andreas Lubitz purposely used the controls to speed up the plane's descent, according to the French air accident investigation agency, the BEA. The flight data recorder, or \"black box,\" was found Thursday by recovery teams that have spent days since the March 24 crash scouring the mountainside in the French Alps where the plane went down. A statement from the BEA on Friday said its teams had immediately begun to investigate its contents. \"The initial readout shows that the pilot present in the cockpit used the autopilot to put the (airplane) into a descent towards an altitude of 100 (feet) then, on several occasions during the descent, the pilot modified the autopilot setting to increase the speed of the (airplane) in descent,\" it said. \"Work is continuing to establish the precise history of the flight.\" Evidence from the plane's cockpit voice recorder, recovered swiftly after the crash, had already led investigators to believe that Lubitz acted deliberately to bring down the plane, killing all 150 people on board. And prosecutors in Germany said Thursday that an analysis of a tablet device retrieved from the 27-year-old's apartment in Dusseldorf revealed that he had researched suicide methods and cockpit door security on the Internet. The correspondence and search history on the device demonstrated that the co-pilot used it from March 16 to March 23, Dusseldorf prosecutor Christoph Kumpa said. The search history was not deleted and also revealed searches concerning medical treatment, the prosecutor said. Investigators have focused on Lubitz's health as they try to establish his motivation. But the missing \"black box\" was expected to yield important evidence about the plane's final minutes. A female police officer digging by hand for clothes in a ravine that been searched previously found the flight data recorder Thursday afternoon about 8 inches (20 centimeters) below the surface, Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin told reporters. Usually white with florescent orange, this discovered recorder lived up to its name as a black box because fire had darkened it with ashes. In addition, out of more than 2,000 DNA samples collected from the crash site, lab workers have isolated 150 DNA profiles, Robin told reporters. \"That does not mean we've identified\" the crash's 150 victims, Robin said -- noting the recovered DNA still must be compared with DNA submitted by the families of those who died in the crash. Authorities have also found 470 personal effects at the site, according to Robin. That number includes 40 cell phones, though all those were badly damaged. Robin cast doubt that any useful information could be retrieved from those phones, given their condition. That view is consistent with French officials' claims Wednesday insisting that two publications, German daily Bild and French Paris Match, were wrong to report that cell phone video showed the harrowing final seconds from on board the flight. Noting he's made a criminal request to German authorities but is for now conducting his own investigation, the French prosecutor said he is tasked with an involuntary homicide investigation. But Robin noted that Lubitz made voluntary actions -- such as guiding the plane toward the mountain and reducing its speed to prevent alarms from going off -- and was \"alive and conscious\" to the very end. A European official government official with detailed knowledge of the investigation said that Lubitz's actions amount to \"premeditated murder.\" While cautioning that there are still many holes in understanding Lubitz's motivation, the disclosures about his Internet searches show that he planned to do what he was going to do, according to this official. Calls for crash avoidance technology . It is becoming increasingly clear to investigators that Lubitz was \"very afraid\" he would lose his license to fly because of his medical issues, a law enforcement source with detailed knowledge of the investigation told CNN on Thursday. It's already emerged that Lubitz had battled depression years before he took the controls of Flight 9525 and that he had concealed from his employer recent medical leave notes saying he was unfit for work. But the law enforcement source said that after a severe depressive episode in 2009, Lubitz relapsed with severe depression and stress in late 2014. In the weeks leading up to the crash, Lubitz was shopping doctors, seeing at least five, perhaps as many as six, the source said, as he kept going from one doctor to the next seeking help, including from a sleep specialist. He was prescribed powerful medication, though it's not clear he was taking it. Opinion: What if my patient is a pilot? CNN's Margot Haddad reported from Marseille, and Laura Smith-Spark wrote from London. CNN's Pamela Brown and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.",

        "article": "Most women have known the frustrated feeling of nursing the broken heel of a irreplaceable shoe. Or perhaps even experienced the struggle of finding footwear that is appropriate for all occasions. Tanya Heath Paris\u00a0has revolutionised women's footwear with her collection of shoes that feature an interchangeable heel. Scroll down for video . Tanya Heath Paris features hundreds of heel varieties that slide and click into place, and can be released at the push of a button . A high heel (up to 3.5 inches) can be swapped for a lower heel (1.5 inches),without compromising the style . The first of their kind, the shoes, which start from \u00a3260) are supposedly comfortable and come in a variety of styles. Every shoe features a button on the inside of the shoe, in the centre of the heel. Once a new heel is slid into the shoe, it is locked into place, and at the press of the button, the heel can be released and slid out of place. The fact that the heel unlocks also makes awkward packing attempts a lot easier, and means that the heels can be also be slipped into an evening bag. In terms of storing the shoes, the heel can easily be slid off and packed away, which makes for less clumsy carrying or packing . There are hundreds of heel varieties available, from high to low, stiletto to chunky, and in a large array of prints . The brand was perfected in September 2013, with the tagline reading: 'Same shoe, different heels, endless possibilities.' From strappy metallic sandals, to versatile black pumps, there are styles to fit all occasions, and that's before the multitude of heel choices are taken into consideration. Canadian-born designer Tanya Heath has lived and worked in Paris for the last 20 years . The interchangeable heels come in all widths, from chunky and secure, to a stylish stiletto, and prints vary from leopard print, to pink glitter, to even adorned with metal spikes. Undoubtedly, the real sell is that, without changing the form or composition of the actual shoe, a high heel (up to 3.5 inches) can be swapped in for a low heel (1.5 inches). Masterminding the brand is Canadian fashion designer, Tanya Heath. The 44-year-old has lived and worked in Paris for the last 20 years, and worked in strategy, consulting, technology and private equity. Also a wife and a mum of three, Heath had no prior professional training and was completely self-taught. When Tanya talks about inspiration for the start of the brand, she insists that it was completely personal. '[The inspiration was] From my life. I wore high heels to work, to restaurants, to parties. 'I wore them everywhere but I could never manage the pain. Once I nearly had a car accident when my heel locked under the break. 'I just fantasised non-stop about a shoe where you could just take the heels off, and that would go from a comfortable low-heel to a high-heel, and still make me look good!' Tanya has admitted that it was difficult to create a shoe, where the composition wouldn't change depending on the height of the heel. 'It took 14 engineers and two and a half years to perfect the arch and the clip. 'Once we had a working principle, over 10 designers, shoe technicians and last specialists worked on creating styles that work in multi-height.' Her shoe collection has now become fully integrated with her own wardrobe. She has worn a style from the collection 'every day of my life for the past 3 years!' Tanya Heath's invention means that high stilettos (pictured left) can be swapped for a chunky more comfortable heel (pictured right) depending on the occasion . It's not only just the heel height that's the selling point - different prints can boost the outfit. In this case, pink sparkly heels are being chosen and slid on . In terms of the celebrities Tanya would want to wear the heels, the list is endless. 'There are so many women who I admire. I would love Kate Middleton to try a pair because she has single-handedly re-branded fashion for the monarchy. 'And also Emma Thompson, who was so clearly unhappy with the comfort of her heels last year at the Academy Awards.'",

        "article": "The parents of a 5-year-old boy whose body was found inside a septic tank in Virginia last month have been charged with felony child abuse and neglect. Pulaski County Sheriff Jim Davis announced the arrests of Ashley Jennifer White, 30, and Paul Thomas, 32, Thursday afternoon \u2013 a week to the day after the tragic discovery. Their 5-year-old son, Noah Thomas, went missing from their home in rural Dublin on the morning of March 22 as his mother slept with her infant daughter. Parents in custody:\u00a0Ashley Jennifer White (left), 30, and her partner Paul Thomas (right), 32, have been charged with child abuse and neglect in the death of their 5-year-old son, Noah, last month . Tragic: Noah Thomas, five, was last seen watching cartoons March 22 at home in Dublin, Virginia. Police confirmed his body was found in a septic tank near the family home March 26 . From left; Virginia State Police Lt. Ed Murphy, Pulaski County Sheriff Jim Davis, Pulaski County Commonwealth Attorney, Mike Fleenor, during a press conference Thursday announcing the arrest of White and Thomas . After an intense-five days search, the child's body was found in a septic tank on White and Thomas' property. 'It came to a point where the evidence that we had we felt was sufficient to arrest them for probable cause,' said Commonwealth's Attorney Mike Fleenor of Pulaski County, reported Indianapolis Star. The couple's 6-month-old daughter was removed from their home and placed in the custody of social services the day after Noah's body was recovered. White and Thomas were each charged with two counts of neglect and abuse involving Noah and his baby sister. During their arraignment via teleconference Friday, both suspects objected to the presence of reporters in the courtroom. 'This is the saddest thing that\u2019s ever happened to me in my life,' White was quoted as saying. 'I don\u2019t feel people should be able to enjoy it over dinner.' Her boyfriend sounded a similar note, saying that he doesn't want his life to be a news story. The judge, however, allowed members of the media to stay in the room. They are being held in jail without bond pending a court hearing scheduled for August 12. Investigators are now waiting for the medical examiner's office to release the results of Noah's autopsy to shed light on the cause of death, which could take weeks, if not months. Search crews have looked around the boy's house. His mother could not find him after she woke up at 10 . Investigators said search dogs stopped near the road near Noah's house, which is 'never typical' White said Noah, pictured left with his dad and right, was a cautious child who would not have run away . Noah Thomas was last seen alive sitting in his parents' living room and watching cartoons at 9am March 22. His mother took her baby daughter, Abigail, to another room and settled in for a nap. More than an hour later, she woke up to find the back door open and Noah gone. Nearly five days later, an FBI-backed search concluded with the discovery of Noah's lifeless body in a septic tank near the family home. Police and more than 100 volunteers who signed up to look for Noah in the small town had covered about 3.3 square miles after the 60lb red-headed boy was reported missing. Pulaski County Sheriff Jim Davis said at the time that authorities have no evidence of foul play in his disappearance, and that the family have cooperated with authorities. Investigators said search dogs stopped near the road adjacent to Noah's house, which is 'never typical'. No suspicious vehicles were seen in the area. Crews used helicopters in the search in the area, which is mostly residential with farmland and a woods by the boy's house. Ashley White, who called police at 11am after searching for her child on her own, said that the boy was cautious and had no history of running away. Stephanie Ide Hudgins, Paul Thomas' sister, described her brother and his partner as 'the best parents, hands down,' reported Roanoke Times. High school sweethearts: White and Thomas (pictured left and right) met in junior high school but did not start dating until high school . Touched by tragedy: The couple lost a good friend in a deadly abduction in 2000, and White's father was later murdered . Proud dad: Thomas' sister said her brother and his partner were very excited about having a baby togehter. Thomas pictured here with Noah not long after his birth . Hudgins, a mother of four, said she would often call Ashley if she had any questions about child-rearing. Noah's aunt detailed how Thomas and White met in junior high school but did not start dating until high school. The couple have been touched by tragedy in the past. A friend who helped arrange their first date, Tara Rose Munsey, disappeared in January 2000 from her job at a Taco Bell. Her body was discovered in a ravine two weeks later. She was 16 years old. Some years later, White's father was murdered and her mother became gravely ill. Before the mother's passing, White and Thomas decided to have a baby together. 'They were so excited to have Noah,' Hudgins said. 'Noah was special anyways, before he even came into this earth.'",

        "article": "It's not just your imagination: most American teenagers are online or on their smartphones every day, and many are almost continually connected. A Pew Research Center survey found that 92 percent of US teens go online daily - and 24% admit they are online constantly. It also\u00a0household incomes can influence which social network children use - with Instagram and Snapchat being popular with children from wealthier families. A Pew Research Center survey found that 92 percent of US teens go online daily - and 25% admit they are online constantly. The Pew researcher revealed household incomes can influence which social network children use. That includes 56 percent who are online several times a day and 24 percent who say they are connected to the Internet and social networks 'almost constantly.' A key factor is the growing prevalence of smartphones. The survey of teens between the ages of 13 and 17 found that 73 percent had a smartphone and 30 percent had at least a basic cellphone. Even though 87 percent of teens have access to a computer, 91 percent went online daily using a mobile device at least occasionally, Pew found. The survey found that African-American and Hispanic youth are among the most active Internet users. Among African-American teens, 34 percent reported going online 'almost constantly' as did 32 percent of Hispanic youth and 19 percent of white teens. 'American teens, especially African-American youth, have embraced smartphones and the 24/7 access to people and information that they offer,' said Amanda Lenhart, a Pew researcher and the lead author of the report. Some 90 percent of teens with phones exchange text messages, with a typical teenager receiving 30 texts per day, Pew found. And one-third of those with smartphones use messaging apps such as WhatsApp or Kik. The researchers found Facebook remains the dominant social media network for young Americans despite the rise of new platforms. Among the teens surveyed, 71 percent said they used Facebook, with Instagram -- owned by Facebook -- the number two social media service used by 52 percent. Among the teens surveyed, Facebook was still the most popular . Asked about other social media, 41 percent of teens said they use Snapchat, 33 percent named Twitter and Google Plus, 24 percent were on Twitter-owned Vine and 14 percent used Yahoo-owned Tumblr. The figures appear to allay concerns that Facebook is being abandoned by youth as more older Internet users join the world's biggest social network. 'Even as Facebook remains an important platform for a majority of teens, Instagram is commanding the attention of half of teens, and Snapchat nearly that number,' said Lenhart. 'There are some interesting differentials in the most frequently used social platforms, with lower income teens using Facebook more often, while wealthier teens -- while still using Facebook -- are more likely than less wealthy teens to report that they use Snapchat or Twitter most often.' More than two-thirds of the teens surveyed said they use more than one social network. But of those who use only one, 66 percent said they opted for Facebook, with Google Plus and Instagram tied for second place with 13 percent each. The report was based on an online survey of 1,060 teens from September 25 to October 9, 2014 and February 10 to March 16, 2015. The margin of error was estimated at 3.7 percentage points. The Pew Research Center survey found that 92% of US teens go online daily - and 25% say they are online constantly .",

The 29-year-old England seamer is back in Test contention in the Caribbean after his comeback last summer was cut short by injury. He managed 18 wickets in four Tests prior to that, playing a big part for an England side often criticised for going easy on the speed gun. Liam Plunkett wants to use his pace to lead England to victory in the Test series against West Indies . Plunkett returned to the England fold last summer in Test series against Sri Lanka and India . Plunkett has recovered from a minor ankle complaint in Yorkshire's pre-season trip to Abu Dhabi . A minor ankle complaint during Yorkshire's pre-season trip to Abu Dhabi proved to be nothing more than a brief setback and he is now looking to make a name for himself in a part of the world that is famous for its quick men. 'I'm trying to be the fastest (bowler on the pitch). I train hard at it and I feel that's why I stand out from the rest,' he said ahead of Monday's two-day warm-up against a St Kitts & Nevis Invitation XI. 'I feel like I'm adaptable but you might need those little patches in the game - where it's a bit dead and there's good batters - to try and rough them up a bit. 'That's why I'm in the team, because I do bowl fast. 'I'm not a bowler who runs up and just hits line and length all day, I want to do something, I want to ruffle batsmen up. If that's what I'm asked to do, I'm happy to do that.' With James Anderson and Stuart Broad likely to retain new ball duties for the first Test in Antigua on April 13, Plunkett is fighting for a place with Barbados-born Chris Jordan and the uncapped Mark Wood. There is a case to be made for both his rivals, Jordan being more familiar with conditions in his homeland and Wood an unknown quantity to the opposition, but Plunkett relishes the scrap. 'It's a good unit, a good bunch of lads and we're all working hard. There's massive competition,' he said. 'It's up to me to bowl well in practice and in the warm-up games and get the chance to play in the first Test. 'You don't want to just get in easily. You want to feel like you've earned your place and outbowled the other guys. You want to be the best bowler. 'Last summer I felt the best I had in my career, I felt good with the ball, I felt confident. Plunkett is fighting for a start in the England Test side with Chris Jordan and Mark Wood . Plunkett (second left) could feature in a warm-up game for England that begins on Monday . 'I felt I was in a situation where I could win games for England. It didn't quite happen but I bowled nicely. 'Then I got the injury, went away this winter with the Lions and I feel good again. I got some wickets and some good rhythm so it would be good to play that first Test.' England plan to play a standard XI man fixture on Monday, with their selection likely to provide a clear insight into their preferred Test side.",

        "article": "The Queen has spent a second day enjoying the spring sunshine in Windsor Great Park this week. Her Majesty, who is approaching her 89th birthday, was spotted riding her faithful black Fell pony, Carltonlima Emma, as she was joined by Lord Vestey and her Head Groom Terry Pendry in the beautiful park close to her Windsor Castle home on Monday. She was well prepared for any spring showers in a lightweight waterproof, and, as is her wont, eschewed a helmet in favour of one of her silk scarves. Scroll down for video . Outing: The Queen has spent a second day enjoying the spring sunshine in Windsor Great Park this week . On Thursday the Monarch was seen trotting through the park again with Pendry as the sunshine lit up the blooming flora. Today's second riding partner, Lord Vestry, is a close friend of the Royal Family and also the Queen's Master of the Horse,\u00a0regularly photographed with the Monarch at equestrian events and important ceremonial occasions. The multi-millionaire, 72, is one of Britain's richest men thanks to the Vestey family's\u00a0estimated \u00a3750million fortune through the family meat business, Vestey Foods Group. Active: Her Majesty, who is approaching her 89th birthday, was spotted riding her faithful black Fell pony, Carltonlima Emma . Park life: The Queen was joined by Lord Vestey and her Head Groom Terry Pendry . Whilst Lord Vestry and Pendry wore hard hats for the ride, the Queen wore only a light, floral headscarf. She finished the look with some pale jodphurs and deep, brown riding boots. Despite being encouraged to use a riding helmet in the past the Queen has reportedly never worn one because of her hair. Speaking in an interview last year, her racing trainer Ian Balding recalled the moment he asked why the monarch never wears a riding hat. The Queen is said to have replied: 'I never have and you don\u2019t have to have your hair done like I do.' Her Majesty is famous for her love of horses and first found herself in the saddle at the age of four after being presented with a Shetland pony, named Peggy, aged four. Since then, the royal stables have been home to a succession of steeds, among them Betsy, a black farm-bred horse who was her mount of choice in the 50's, and Surprise, a grey gelding whom the Queen famously galloped down the course at Ascot in 1961. No helmet: The Queen, pictured here on Friday, never wears a riding helmet preferring instead to ride in a silk headscarf . Cutting back: She has ridden less in recent years as a result of a niggling knee injury . Recent years have seen her cut down on the amount of time she spends in the saddle - the result of a niggling knee injury that also forced her to give up presiding over Trooping the Colour on horseback. Nevertheless, the Queen remains an enthusiastic equestrienne and, according to sources, is a familiar sight at her Windsor stables. She is also said to take a keen interest in all her horses and ponies, some of whom are now ridden by her grandchildren, notably Prince Edward's children, Lady Louise and James, Viscount Severn. Along with her thoroughbred race horses, the Queen also breeds Fell ponies and has a stud specialising in Highland ponies at Balmoral. First love: The Queen's first pony was a tiny Shetland named Peggy who was given to her at the age of four . Familiar sight: The Queen riding her much-loved horse Burmese during Trooping the Colour . Seal of approval: A Fell pony foal similar to those being bred by the Queen at Hampton Court . One of the oldest equine breeds on the planet, Fell ponies like the Queen's mount Carltonlima Emma, have roamed the moors of Cumbria since the Neolithic period. Docile, hardy and thick-set, the majority of Fell ponies are black, grey or bay and measure between 13 and 14hh. Highly prized by the Carvetii, the Iron Age tribe who occupied the region more than two millennia ago, the ponies later caught the eye of the invading Romans and were used as trade goods all over the Empire. The Romans also helped develop the breed into the relatively large animal it is today. Originally thought to have stood around 12hh tall (similar to Dartmoor and Exmoor ponies), by the end of the Roman period, the average Fell was more than a hand higher. Another invader to fall in love with the Fell pony was the Vikings, who used the animals as pack ponies; a use continued by the Normans. By the 13th century, the Fell's usefulness as a pack animal was well-established and the pony played an important role in British trade until the end of the 18th century. Following the Industrial Revolution, Fells were used to transport iron ore and coal from mine to town, as well as underground when the height of the shaft allowed. Although previously used in trotting races, the Fell pony really came into its as a riding horse in the 1950s, when its gentle nature and pretty looks made it the pony of choice for families. Today, the pony remains a popular choice for riders of all ages, among them the Queen who breeds Fell ponies at her Hampton Court stud. Source: The Fell Pony Society .",

        "article": "Spain's 2-0 defeat by Holland on Tuesday brought back bitter memories of their disastrous 2014 World Cup, but coach Vicente del Bosque will not be too worried about a third straight friendly defeat, insists Gerard Pique. Holland, whose 5-1 drubbing of Spain in the group stage in Brazil last year marked the end of the Iberian nation's six-year domination of the world game, scored two early goals at the Amsterdam Arena and held on against some determined Spain pressure in the second half for a 2-0 success. They became the first team to inflict two defeats on Del Bosque since he took over in 2008 but the gruff 64-year-old had used the match to try out several new faces and he fielded a largely experimental, second-string team. Stefan de Vrij (right) headed Holland in front against Spain at the Amsterdam Arena on Tuesday . Gerard Pique (left) could do nothing to stop Davy Klaassen doubling the Dutch advantage . Malaga forward Juanmi and Sevilla midfielder Vitolo became the 55th and 56th players to debut under Del Bosque, while the likes of goalkeeper David de Gea, defenders Raul Albiol, Juan Bernat and Dani Carvajal and midfielder Mario Suarez all started the game. 'The national team's state of health is good,' centre back Gerard Pique told reporters. 'We are in a process where players are coming into the team and gathering experience,' added the Barcelona defender. 'We are second in qualifying (for Euro 2016) and these friendly games are for experimenting. 'I am not that worried about this match because we lost friendlies in previous years and then ended up winning titles.' David de Gea was given a start by Vicente del Bosque but could not keep out De Vrij's header here . Dani Carvajal (centre) was another squad player given a chance to impress against Holland . Del Bosque will be confident he can find the right mix of players to secure Spain's berth at Euro 2016 in France next year, when they will be chasing an unprecedented third straight title. Slovakia are the surprise leaders in qualifying Group C thanks to a 2-1 win over Spain in Zilina in October and have a maximum 15 points from five of 10 matches. Spain are second on 12 points, three ahead of Ukraine, who they beat 1-0 in Seville on Friday. Del Bosque's side host Slovakia in September in a match that could decide who goes through to the finals as group winners. 'The team is in good shape,' forward Pedro told reporters. 'We have a very clear idea of our playing style and we are able to count on people who are gradually making a place for themselves in the team.'",

Sterling has escaped a club punishment after being caught on video inhaling the legal high nitrous oxide, but fresh pictures have emerged of him holding a shisha pipe, this time alongside young team-mate Jordon Ibe. Sterling, 20, and Ibe, 19, were pictured during what is believed to be a visit to a shisha cafe in London earlier this season. The teenager was spotted arriving at Melwood on Wednesday just seconds after Sterling. Ibe was driving a black Range Rover while Sterling arrived in a white version of the same model. Liverpool forward Raheem Sterling pictured arriving at training on Wednesday morning . Sterling arrived at Melwood in a white Range Rover after fresh pictures emerged of him with a shisha pipe . Jordon Ibe at Melwood on Wednesday after he was also pictured alongside Sterling holding a shisha . Sterling is expected to meet Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers on Thursday and he will be reminded of his professional responsibilities and warned about the consequences of taking a drug that has been called \u2018hippy crack\u2019. Rodgers questioned Sterling\u2019s professionalism on Monday after footage emerged of the 20-year-old unconscious in his house in Southport having taken nitrous oxide with two unnamed friends. Liverpool players Raheem Sterling and Jordon Ibe have been pictured smoking a shisha pipe . This is the second time Sterling has been pictured smoking from a shisha pipe in the past few days . Shisha is a water pipe in which flavoured tobacco is roasted with charcoal. The tobacco smoke passes through a water chamber and is inhaled deeply and slowly. The flavoured tobacco smells sweet, making it an enjoyable and relaxing experience, according to enthusiasts. Despite the smoke passing through water, all the risks of smoking a regular cigarette are present \u2013 including respiratory and heart diseases, as well as cancer. During an hour-long Shisha smoking session, it has been estimated the smoke inhaled is the equivalent of between 100 and 200 cigarettes. It has been a chastening week for Sterling. Pictures were published on Sunday of him smoking a shisha pipe and then a different set of images surfaced on Tuesday of Sterling and Ibe. Casually dressed, the pair are sat on a sofa in front of a table with shisha pipes, cans of fizzy Fanta orange and a portable music speaker. Ibe, wearing a red hoodie and ripped black jeans, is pictured holding a shisha pipe. He is sitting next to Sterling, who is wearing a tight white v-neck t-shirt and blue jeans, on the sofa. The pair can be seen smiling and joking as they hold on to the pipes in the bar. The pictures are believed to have been taken last September. Liverpool offered no\u00a0comment on those photos. The club maintain the matter will be dealt with internally but he is not going to be fined. Sterling enraged Liverpool after saying in a BBC interview that he was \u2018flattered\u2019 to be linked with Arsenal. It is understood, however, that Arsenal have gone cold on Sterling, who scored in Liverpool\u2019s 2-0 win over Newcastle on Monday. All talks about his future have been put on hold until the end of the campaign but Ian Ayre, Liverpool\u2019s chief executive, issued a strong line yesterday, insisting that Sterling \u2014 who has turned down a contract in the region of \u00a3100,000 per week \u2014 would be at Anfield for a \u2018long time\u2019. Ayre said: \u2018Raheem\u2019s agent has asked that we park all discussions regarding his future until the summer. We respect that. Raheem is a Liverpool player and has two years left on his contract. We expect Raheem Sterling to be here for a long time.\u2019 It appears that Sterling and Ibe each have a shisha pipe and are also drinking Fanta . Sterling was pictured on social media smoking a shisha pipe in a story published over the weekend . Sterling was also filmed apparently inhaling nitrous oxide - known as 'hippy crack' Shisha pipes are used to smoke fruit-flavoured tobacco, which is burned on hot coals, through a long tube. They are commonly used in the Middle East. It is said that one single shisha session is equal to smoking around 200 cigarettes, which calls into question the professionalism of any athlete using the pipe. The British Heart Foundation website it clearly states: \u2018Like cigarettes [shisha] contains nicotine, tar, carbon monoxide and heavy metals, such as arsenic and lead.' Sterling, who has 14 caps for England, was pictured on a social media site with the picture captioned \u20181 down 3 to go\u2019, suggesting he did not just take a single drag on the pipe.

        "article": "Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton enjoyed some downtime with husband Bill on Saturday afternoon, taking a stroll near their Chappaqua, New York, home. Meanwhile, her two 'Scooby' campaign vans got some TLC of their own at a local body shop, where they were also hand washed. The aspiring leader of the free world and her husband were spotted wearing blue ball caps - Hillary's bearing the Clinton Foundation logo- and matching dark blue shirts as they soaked in the sun and walked hand-in-hand through a nearby park. Mrs Clinton will hit the campaign trail again today in New Hampshire, where she'll hold a round table at a family-owned business this afternoon. She'll participate in another tomorrow morning at a community college during her two-day swing through the Granite State. Scroll down for videos . EXCLUSIVE: Hilary Clinton and husband Bill go for a stroll \u00a0while holding hands in a park in Chappaqua, New York.\u00a0The aspiring leader of the free world and her husband were spotted wearing blue ball caps - Hillary's bearing the Clinton Foundation logo - and matching dark blue polo shirts as they soaked in the sun . CHECK-UP: The Scooby vans had made the 1,000 miles trip back from Iowa since Hillary flew home commercial last week . SPARKLING: The secret of keeping the Scooby fleet immaculate is regular washing . TUNE-UP: Clinton's presidential campaign prepared to hit the road again on Saturday, taking the two armored Scooby vans to a car shop for inspection . Mrs. Clinton will hit the campaign trail again today in New Hampshire, where she'll hold a round table at a family-owned business this afternoon . Clinton is seen here on Saturday, walking with her Secret Service agent.\u00a0She's currently on a two-day swing through the Granite State . Clinton starts the second leg of her endeavor to win the vote of 'everyday' Americans on the heels of a news report showing she makes more money for an hour's worth of work than the country's top CEOs. The former secretary of state was banking $300,000 for paid appearances\u00a0before she ditched the speaking circuit for an offensive on the White House. The average CEO's hourly rate is $54,213, the Washington Examiner, pointed out. She makes more on the days she's paid a premium to give remarks than big wigs of the likes of Ralph Lauren,\u00a0Kinder Morgan Energy Partners co-founder Richard Kinder and former Vornado president and CEO Michael\u00a0Fascitelli. Taken in the context of a full work week, though, Clinton's rate drops far below what corporate heads are hauling in. She receives checks for just over a tenth of what America's highest paid CEO, John Hammergren of medical supply company McKesson Corporation, earns in a week. Bill joined her for the outing and walked alongside her with his Secret Service agent . First Scooby tour: Vans made return trip after Hillary left on Wednesday and were in Chappaqua on Saturday . A multimillionaire who has spent the better part of the last two and a half decades living in Washington, D.C. and New York, Clinton has struggled to shed her image as an up-tight politician who cares more about winning the keys to the kingdom, so to speak, than she does boosting blue collar workers. The negative connotations kept Clinton her from beating Barack Obama in 2008 and already threatening to wreck her second attempt at the nation's highest elected office. While driving with one of her aides from New York to Iowa for a first round of campaigning last week, the two women stopped off at Chipotle for lunch. They work dark sunglasses, kept quiet and went unrecognized. It took security camera footage to prove they were ever there. Once in Iowa, Clinton's campaign vetted and planted fans of the Democrat in a coffee shop it knew she would make an unannounced stop at and hold what appeared at the time to be an impromptu round table discussion. The back-to-back incidents were widely panned as further proof that Clinton is out-of-touch. Clinton skipped the long ride home and returned via commercial aircraft. She sat in the coach section, though, and was photographed dragging around her own luggage. WEEKEND OUTING: Hillary wasn't the only one spending time with her husband. Huma Abedin, her closest aide, was with her husband Anthony Weiner, notorious for sabotaging his own political career by sending explicit pictures. The couple ignored the chance to go to Chipotle, two doors down from this New York taco restaurant .

But the fine weather by much of the country is set to be replaced by showers this weekend . Tomorrow is set to be another fine day for many places, although it will be cloudy to start in some central and eastern areas of the UK. There will be plenty of sunshine in England, Wales, southern Scotland and Northern Ireland, a Met Office forecaster told MailOnline. Temperatures are expected to hover in the high teens, and could climb to 21C in brighter spots of the north west of England. The exception is northern Scotland, where it thicker cloud will bring lower temperatures of roughly 14C and some patchy rain.

The forecaster said: 'There will be a band of rain coming into the south west and another coming into the north of Scotland. The fine weather will be squeezed out from two directions.

Forecaster Marco Petagna said there could be a chance of hail or thunderstorms in the south over the weekend. By Saturday, the high pressure that has brought the recent good weather will have gone. Most of the country will see showers at some point over the weekend, but 'it will not be a complete washout'.

He said: 'Looking ahead, it will be windier than of late, particularly in the north. Temperatures are going to be feeling rather cold in the rain and the stronger winds. 'The theme is going to continue into May, but by the middle of May there will be some settled weather.

        "article": "Trailing Birmingham City by two goals, Bournemouth were down to fourth in the Championship at one stage in the afternoon but a thrilling four-goal turnaround moved them back to the top. \u2018That\u2019s the madness of it,\u2019 manager Eddie Howe said in the aftermath. \u2018I couldn't believe in one game we dropped to fourth. It\u2019s great for the neutral, but not so great for us.\u2019 The south coast club had not conceded the first goal at Dean Court this campaign and have struggled to get anything from losing positions, but comebacks rarely come better than being two behind after 21 minutes. Charlie Daniels (right) fires home from the edge of the box to seal the win and make it 4-2 to Bournemouth . Yann Kermorgant slots home a penalty to cap a remarkable comeback and make it 3-2 to Bournemouth . BOURNEMOUTH (4-4-2): Boruc; Francis, Cook, Elphick, Daniels; Ritchie, Surman, Arter, Fraser (Smith 56); Kermorgant (Pitman 87), Wilson (Jones 88). Subs not used:\u00a0Camp, Ward, Gosling, Stanislas.

Attendance: 11,084 . Watford temporarily moved top by beating Middlesbrough, who started the day as leaders, in the lunch-time kick-off and Norwich then went above them with victory against Sheffield Wednesday. But Bournemouth have been this season\u2019s pacesetters and clearly have no intention of stepping aside for the final sprint to the finish line. It did not feel like that, however, when the visitors stunned them with two goals in three minutes. A straightforward ball was played over the top from central midfield by Andrew Shinnie, on 18 minutes, and Clayton Donaldson burst through on goal. Bournemouth goalkeeper Artur Boruc started to come from his line then hesitated and before he knew it the striker had sent the ball over him and in. \u2018We want eight,\u2019 the travelling Birmingham supporters chanted in jest, demanding vengeance for Bournemouth thrashing them 8-0 in the reverse of this fixture back in October. That scoreline became less fantastical when they added a second in the 21st minute. Birmingham winger David Cotterill made a strong run down the right and with a defender backing off he buried a strike across goal into the bottom left corner. \u2018That didn\u2019t feel too good,\u2019 Howe admitted. \u2018I\u2019d be lying if I said nerves won\u2019 t come into it, it\u2019s only natural considering what\u2019s at stake.\u2019 But Bournemouth have not got around the automatic qualification places by buckling under pressure and they scored twice before the break. Callum Wilson rounds Birmingham keeper Darren Randolph to draw Bournemouth level . Wilson celebrates his 17th league goal of the season as Bournemouth fight back from two goals down . Steve Cook (centre) battles past a host of Birmingham defenders to score for Bournemouth and make it 2-1 . On 39 minutes, Matt Ritchie whipped in a corner from the right-hand side and Tommy Elphick and Steve Cook both leapt for it, the latter eventually bundling the ball over the line. Then in first-half stoppage time Yann Kermorgant played a delicate ball through Birmingham\u2019s defence, perfectly weighted between defender and goalkeeper for Callum Wilson to round Darren Randolph and tap in. Only three minutes into the second half and they were in front. Wilson broke free down the right, carried the ball into the box and was scythed down by Birmingham defender Paul Robinson after a cheeky turn. Kermogant stoked in the penalty. \u2018I felt the officials were inconsistent,\u2019 Birmingham manager Gary Rowett said. 'We had three clear onsides given off and Wilson was level when he won the penalty. Elphick tried to slap Rob Kiernan in a melee at the end and the referee was right next to it but gave nothing.\u2019 If Birmingham\u2019s two goals in three minutes were impressive, Bournemouth\u2019s three in nine were even more devastating and they added to that in the 74th minute. Substitute Adam Smith first had a shot from the edge of the box blocked, which left Randolph on the floor, and the midfielder went for the opposite corner only for the keeper to dive back. But there was nothing Randolph could do when the ball came out to Charlie Daniels who struck a shot into the ground which looped in off the bar. The game was over in the 77th minute when Robinson was sent off for a foul last man. Referee Andy Woolmer handed out a straight red card, but it was hard to make out amongst the Birmingham red faces. David Cotterill celebrates making it 2-0 to Birmingham after just 21 minutes . Clayton Donaldson (centre) opens the scoring for Birmingham with a sublime lob over Artur Boruc .

        "article": "A dog breeder and her husband have been jailed for animal cruelty after their animals were found in the 'worst conditions ever seen'. Margaret and Gary Mazan from Bradford, West Yorkshire, had their 14 Red Setters seized by RSPCA inspectors after the animals were discovered in filthy cages in a garden shed. The court heard how the animals had matted fur, were dehydrated and had not been provided with a suitable diet. Cruel: Margaret Mazan (pictured) and her husband Gary were found guilty of animal cruelty after their 14 Red Setters were found in appalling conditions . Sentenced: Margaret (left) and Gary Mazan (right) were jailed for 26 weeks and given a lifetime ban from owning or keeping pets, which they cannot appeal for 25 years . Three of the fully grown dogs were found by inspectors crammed in puppy cages and the majority were kept in a squalid garden shed. Magistrates heard the couple caused unnecessary suffering to some of the dogs by failing to seek veterinary care for their eyes and injuries to their tails. Mrs Mazan, 53, who was said to have shown and bred setters for more than 10 years, chose not to give evidence at Bradford and Keighley Magistrates' Court during the two-day trial. Her husband Gary, 51, who is a long-distance lorry driver, claimed it was Mrs Mazan who had sole responsibility for the dogs. Crammed: The animals were found with matted fur and inside cramped, filthy cages inside a garden shed . Seized: RSPCA inspectors discovered the animals in some of the 'worst conditions' they had ever seen . Owner: Mrs Mazan, who was said to have shown and bred setters for more than 10 years, chose not to give evidence at Bradford and Keighley Magistrates' Court during the two-day trial . The animals had been kept at the family's home since they moved from Leeds to Bradford in February 2013. A month after the move the RSPCA served a warning notice due to the conditions the dogs were being kept in, which had been adhered to by the time they visited again in April 2013. But concerns over the welfare of the animals were raised by a dog warden after they were refused access to the property and called the RSPCA. Emma Ellis, an RSPCA inspector for Bradford who attended the scene and helped to seize the animals, said it was the worst conditions she has seen in her 12 years as an inspector. She said: 'To see 12 dogs living in a small shed, with three fully grown setters living in a puppy cage is horrific. 'They could not sit down or turn around and there fur was matted, covered in urine and faeces. 'When the shed was opened, the smell literally hit you and it was a small like I had never experienced before. I still recall the smell every time I see the photos. Caged: The animals had been kept at the Bradford home since the family moved from Leeds in February 2013 . Matted: The couple were said to have caused unnecessary suffering to the dogs as they failed to seek veterinary care for their eyes and injuries to their tails (pictured) 'To keep animals in these conditions is unacceptable for anyone, let a alone a dog breeder.' The animals are now currently under the care of the RSPCA, after the charity demanded ownership of all the Mazans' pets, including an additional dog, called Clever. The dog, which belonged to the family's daughter who was away at university, had been chipped in Mrs Mazan's name and magistrates decided to transfer custody of the animal, alongside the other 14 dogs, to the RSPCA. Dingle Clark, prosecuting on behalf of the RSPCA, told the court that boarding costs for the dogs since they were seized had reached \u00a348,000, with an additional \u00a37,000 in vets fees. Filthy: Three of the fully grown dogs were found by RSPCA inspectors crammed in puppy cages and the majority were kept in a squalid garden shed. All animals are now in the charity's care . Sentencing the pair to 26 weeks in jail, Allie Coward, chairman of the bench, said: 'We have considered all the evidence, and this was the most heinous act of cruelty against defenceless animals we have ever seen.' An immediate appeal against the sentence was made and a request for bail ahead of any appeal hearing at the Crown Court, but the application for bail was denied by the court. The pair were also given a lifetime ban against owning or keeping any animal, and told they cannot appeal against the order for at least 25 years.",

        "article": "It seems that 2014 was a very, very good year to be Discovery Communications CEO David Zaslav. In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing from Friday, it was revealed that Zaslav was compensated an unbelievable $156.1million last year. This amount, thanks to the success of television events like Shark Week, shows like the once popular Here Comes Honey Boo Boo and his running of networks like OWN, makes him one of the highest paid television executives. Scroll down for video . David Zaslav (above) was compensated $156.1million for his role as CEO of Discovery Communications it was revealed on Friday . This thanks to\u00a0shows like the once popular Here Comes Honey Boo Boo (left) and his running of networks like Oprah Winfrey's OWN (right) Discovery has also done well thanks to the success of television events like Shark Week . Variety reports that a large portion of that money comes from stocks, with Zaslav receiving $144million in awards for his six-year contract. 1.Sumner Redstone\u00a0(CBS, Viacom) - $93.4m . 2.Les Moonves\u00a0(CBS) - $66.9m . 3.Philippe Dauman\u00a0(Viacom) - $37.2m . 4.Bob Iger\u00a0(Disney) - $34.3m . 5.David Zaslav (Discovery) - $33.3m . 6.Jeffrey Bewkes\u00a0(Time Warner) - $32.5m . 7.Brian Roberts\u00a0(Comcast) - $31.4m . 8.Stephen Burke\u00a0(NBC) - $31.1m . 9.Chris Albrecht\u00a0(Starz) - $30.5m . 10.Thomas Dooley (Viacom) - $29.1m . It is a remarkable boost from the $33million he received in 2013, with $22.5million of that also coming from stock awards. The amount seems to be deserved as well, as under Zaslav's guidance, the company's market cap has grown from $5billion in 2007 to $20billion today. As for his base salary, that was $3million, where it will stay for the length of his contract, and he can no receive a cash bonus greater than $6.6million until the last two years of his new contract, when that amount goes to $9million. This amount is far, far greater than the two television executives who made the most last year, Sumer Redstone and Les Moonves. Redstone, who heads up CBS and Viacomn, took home $93.4million, while Moonves, the CEO of CBS, took home $66.9million. 'This contract rewards Mr. Zaslav for the value he has created and the continued strategic direction he provides and requires sustained performance over time for that award to have value,' the filing states. 'At the end of his contract, Mr. Zaslav will own a substantial amount of equity of Discovery, which reinforces his alignment with our shareholders and encourages long-term ownership of our stock.' This amount is far, far greater than the $93million CBS chairman Sumner Redstone (left) made in 2013 and the $67m Les Moonves (right) made . Zaslav is also likely to become the biggest shareholder at Discovery under this new contract is he buys the shares of television mogul\u00a0John Malone who also holds a sizable stake in the company. He will have right of first refusal to purchase Malone's stocks should he sell. The contract will expire in 2019.",

        "article": "They are already talented actresses, one a Hollywood star. But now Aussies Rose Byrne and Gracie Otto are about to add another string to their bow. The Bridesmaids star and daughter of famed Australian actor Barry Otto have, along with fellow actress Krey Boylan, film director Shannon Murphy and PR maven Jessica Carrerea, have launched their very own all female film production company called The Doll House Collective . Byrne believes, in an age where Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook, Arianna Huffington of Huffington Post and Marissa Mayer of Yahoo dominating powerful positions, it's about time they become strong, female leaders in film. Dolled up: Rose Byrne and Gracie Otto have joined up in new film-making collaboration 'The Doll House' Byrne says when Bridesmaids came out, people's first reaction was to be surprised that women could be so funny. Her hope down the track is that they can bring more gender equality in. 'I'd love to get to a day when  people didn't say 'Wow, we didn't know women were so funny' and we have to be like, 'What? We're not a group of dolphins!' Byrne said in an interview with Vogue Australia. Byrne believes Sheryl Sandberg is a pioneer for women, and said the speech she gave in a TED talk about  the benefits of having women in companies was inspirational. Film feminism: The five Australian women want to bring a female body to the film-making industry . Referencing Sandberg, Byrne said it is not only better for your home life, sex life and for the company to have woman in positions of power, both in terms of decision-making, collaborating or delegating. 'Cate Blanchett put it so beautifully in her Oscar's speech about women being consumers - women want to see women doing stunts - there is a market for that!' The quintet will collaborate together on films, share ideas and creative advice, and even provide financial support to each other's projects. Powerful people: Rose Byrne wants new production company to follow in feminist foot steps of Arianna Huffington (left) and Sheryl Sandberg (right) The women liken it to the female equivalent of Blue-Tongue Films, four men who have collaborated to produce a film-making company. Instead of there being only one actor, one director, if they are working on a short film, they all look out for each other, says Otto, so that is there hope for The Doll House. According to Boylan, they were all supporting each other anyway, so they thought it was time they made it official. Fierce and funny: Referencing Bridesmaids,  Byrne says women  can be funny and intelligent, not just dolphins . And the ball is already rolling, with Byrne set to be the executive producer in Boylan's next film project 'Seriously Red.' 'I've never done anything in a producer capacity before but have long had the desire...It can be a lonely business, especially as an actor. 'And I'm tired of talking about how it's lonely instead of taking the reigns and producing and creating my own work,' said Byrne. In vogue: 'The Doll House Collective' girls feature in exclusive May issue of\u00a0Vogue Australia . And with their collective talents combined, these leading Australian women are a force to be reckoned with. Otto says with all their own established work and contacts internationally, they will definitely be taken seriously.

        "article": "Panama City (CNN)This was the handshake that shook the Western Hemisphere. President Obama briefly met his Cuban counterpart, Raul Castro, on Friday night at a dinner for the dozens of Latin American leaders convening in Panama City for the Summit of the Americas. This was historic. The two nations have barely been on speaking terms -- officially -- for more than 50 years. The meeting was so important that Bernadette Meehan, National Security Council spokesperson, issued a statement: \"At the Summit of the Americas this evening, President Obama and President Castro greeted each other and shook hands.\" Cuba and the United States had endured a half-century of enmity, the tension worsened by the two nations being only 90 miles apart. Key events of those years include some of the most traumatic in modern U.S. history, such as the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Bay of Pigs and the Mariel boatlift of 1980. But the two leaders have been building up to the historic face-to-face. Obama spoke by phone Wednesday with the Cuban leader before heading to Panama. They met Friday at the dinner and are expected to spend a lot more time together on Saturday when the summit begins in earnest. Obama arrived in Panama late Thursday for the conference, which in years past was tinged with animosity at Cuba's exclusion. Moments after Marine One, Obama's helicopter, touched down in Panama City, Castro's plane landed on the same tarmac. Panamanian television carried both arrivals live. During their phone call Wednesday, Obama and Castro discussed the ongoing process of normalizing relations between the United States and Cuba, according to Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes. He said it \"made sense\" for the two leaders to communicate before their anticipated interactions Friday and Saturday. Those run-ins will represent the highest-level talks between the United States and Cuba since a meeting between then-Vice President Richard Nixon and then-Prime Minister Fidel Castro in 1959. \"We're in new territory here,\" Rhodes said on Friday. \"The reason we're here is that the President strongly believes that an approach that was focused totally on isolation, focused totally on seeking to cut off the Cuban people from the United States of America had failed.\" Obama was expecting a warm welcome from the dozens of countries represented at the conference, after announcing in December he was seeking to engage Havana in talks over reopening embassies and removing barriers to commerce and travel. In Panama, Obama is expected to announce he's removing Cuba from the United States' list of countries that sponsor terrorism, a major advance in building diplomatic ties between the two countries. The State Department delivered its report on the designation to the White House on Wednesday; Obama said on Thursday a panel of experts was reviewing it before he makes a final determination. The White House isn't ruling out a final decision before Obama leaves Panama late Saturday night. In remarks during a brief stopover in Jamaica on Thursday, Obama strongly hinted he was ready to remove Cuba from the list, which also includes Iran, Sudan and Syria. \"Throughout this process, our emphasis has been on the facts,\" Obama said. \"So we want to make sure that given that this is a powerful tool to isolate those countries that genuinely do support terrorism, that when we make those designations we've got strong evidence that, in fact, that's the case.\" \"As circumstances change, then that list will change as well,\" he said. While some inside Cuba have expressed dissatisfaction at the pace of the diplomatic thaw, U.S. officials say they're pleased at the progress toward re-establishing diplomatic ties, which the White House argues has helped improve relations with other countries in the region. Obama said in Jamaica he \"never foresaw that immediately overnight everything would transform itself.\" The overtures to Cuba have not been universally popular in the United States; some lawmakers were irate that Obama was seeking to engage what they regard as a corrupt government. Even as Obama landed in Panama the long-standing tensions between pro- and anti-Castro activists was on full display. Dissidents opposed to Castro's regime were violently accosted earlier this week by supporters of the Cuban government. Rhodes said the White House had \"expressed serious concerns\" about the violence and would continue to speak in support of human rights reforms on the island.",

        "article": "For former Ole Miss star Marshall Henderson, revenge is a dish best served cold. The ex-college player was mocked for his alleged drug use by Erin Andrews on Twitter two years ago. But he has had the last laugh, after he jumped on revelations the TV reporter's boyfriend, Los Angeles Kings player Jarret Stoll, was busted in Las Vegas last week, accused of tying to smuggle cocaine and MDMA, or 'molly', into the MGM Grand hotel. He tweeted  the former Dancing With The Stars contestant on Monday saying: 'lol wassup with your boyfriend.' Revenge: Former Ole Miss star Marshall Henderson jumped on the revelations Jarret Stoll (right) was arrested in a drugs bust last week by tweeting to Erin Andrews: 'lol wassup with your boyfriend.' He was suspended in 2013 for allegedly failing a drugs test. Andrews responded to the news then by saying: 'He mocking anyone now?' She was referencing his reputation of being a hothead and badmouthing other players. Henderson responded with the message: 'ima save that and you will be the first person ill mock.' He has waited two years to get his revenge. On Monday TMZ sports reported that the athlete was trying to smuggle over three grams of cocaine and over eight grams of MDMA by hiding them in his board shorts. Stoll was previously in the news for non-sports related reasons back in 2013 when he was rushed to the hospital after having a seizure at his home in Hermosa Beach, California during the offseason, with the Kings later saying they did not know what caused the incident. His reaction came two years after the TV reporter said: 'He mocking anyone now?' after he was suspended for failing a drugs test. He warned the ex-Dancing With The Stars contestant she was in the firing line . After learning of Stoll's arrest, he posted this on Twitter to Andrews - getting his revenge two years on . Stoll, who will make a cameo in the upcoming film version of the popular HBO show Entourage, was booked into the Clark County Detention Center and was listed as having a hearing on Saturday after posting $5,000 bail. The charges include possession of Class 1, 2, 3 and 4 controlled substances, including cocaine and ecstasy. Michael Pariente, a Las Vegas criminal defense lawyer, says that Stoll will likely be offered a plea deal as a first time offender. Speaking with TSN, he said; 'It's pretty much a slap on the wrist. Even if he was going to represent himself they'd make him an offer like this.' This would include a $1,000 fee, an online drug awareness course, and possibly community service. Henderson is currently playing in Baghdad in the Iraqi Super League. His history with cocaine and marijuana use led to him being undrafted by the NBA in 2014.

        "article": "(CNN)Change is coming to Ferguson. In the next few weeks the Department of Justice (DOJ) will begin to negotiate in earnest with the city to restructure the police department, which the department has charged with engaging in a pattern and practice of racial discrimination. It should not be forgotten that the DOJ review of the Ferguson Police Department was precipitated by months of protests and activism following the killing of Michael Brown by a Ferguson police officer and by revelations about the town's dysfunctional government and court system by local civil rights law groups. Now, after a half year of unrest, and with citizens on Tuesday electing two new black city council members, change is beginning to come to Ferguson. The question is, what kind of change? The report from the Department of Justice offered a devastating insight into a police department and court system that preyed on its own citizens. Through illegal traffic stops and arrests, and the use of excessive force, the police department held town residents in bondage. The municipal court system used excessive court fines and fees to ensure that citizens arrested for even minor infractions would be charged thousands of dollars or face jail time. Court costs and fees constituted the second-largest sources of revenue for the town. Rather than a force for public safety, the Ferguson Police Department became, according to Attorney General Eric Holder, \"a collection agency\" -- one that preyed disproportionately on the town's African-American residents. The evidence of ugly and explicit racial discrimination was devastating. It included blatantly racist emails traded among officers, and evidence that African-Americans were victims in all of the police canine bite incidents recorded by the department. But just a few weeks before the release of the report, the Ferguson police chief declared there were \"no racial issues\" in his department. Ferguson's ugly, racist emails released . The recommendations in the report, ranging from new training and supervision of police officers, addressing racially discriminatory conduct to structural revisions in the court system, will, if implemented, remake the law enforcement system in the town. (A grand jury that investigated the shooting of Brown by Officer Darren Wilson chose not to file charges against him and the Justice Department also didn't find reason to prosecute.) Without question, change is coming to the town's government. Town Manager John Shaw, Ferguson's most powerful official and, until the DOJ's blistering report, the one who inexplicably managed to elude public scrutiny, resigned weeks ago and has been replaced by the city's deputy manager. Three sitting city council members chose not to run for office again and, on Tuesday, citizens elected two black candidates to the city council, changing its racial composition: Five of six members and the mayor were white. Now the council will be 50% black. Ferguson's hapless police Chief Thomas Jackson also finally resigned after holding on through a months-long display of astonishing incompetence. The department first drew the attention of the nation for its display of military weaponry and tear gas in response to civilian protests.  The appointment of a commander from the State Highway Patrol was deemed necessary to begin quelling the unrest and to build community trust in the early days of the protest. Jackson's departure sent an important signal to the population of a town preyed upon by officers under his command. And so we can be certain that along with the new makeup of the city council, there will be a new police chief in Ferguson. But does that mean that fundamental change will come to Ferguson? Not necessarily. Not unless protest and activism during this critical period turns to influence the vitally important opportunities that lie ahead in the coming weeks. The Department of Justice's full-on negotiations with the leadership in Ferguson will determine the shape of the new Ferguson Police Department. Indeed, the DOJ report alludes to the possibility of disbanding the department in favor of a regional policing integration with St. Louis County. Many local activists have suggested just such a solution, but given ongoing problems with policing in the county -- including the role of county forces in some of the most controversial clashes with activists in Ferguson last fall -- community representatives will have to fight hard to ensure that the DOJ can fold St. Louis County Police into its monitoring and reform process. Equally important were the April 7 general elections. Turnout in municipal elections has been notoriously low in Ferguson, with white voters nearly three times more likely to turn out than African-Americans. But local groups had engaged in vigorous voter registration and get-out-the-vote campaigns.. The Mayor has two years left to his term and has defiantly insisted that he will not resign (although a petition for his recall has been circulating). That means that he will be a lead voice in negotiating with the DOJ to remake the police department. Has he committed to a clear set of principles that will guide his participation in those talks? Community activists and residents must ensure that Mayor James Knowles plans to represent their vision of new Ferguson Police Department. But there is an opportunity to begin thinking about even more ambitious structural change in Ferguson and throughout St. Louis County. Ferguson's governing structure, with a strong city manager and a weak council and mayor, mirrors that of thousands of other suburbs in the United States. That form of governance might have been precisely what thriving, middle class white suburbanites wanted when they fled racial integration in cities like St. Louis. But working class suburbs like Ferguson with a majority black population in which the needs of the population in the areas of education and economic opportunity more closely hews to the needs of urban residents, may need a more robust form of governance. In any case, a system in which the elected officials have minimal power, but non-elected leaders, like the town manager and the chief of police, have inordinate power, is a recipe for the kind of unaccountable, non-representative government that controlled Ferguson's residents. Yet this precise form of government is in wide use across the country. Likewise, Missouri, like the vast majority of states, holds municipal elections in non-presidential election years, guaranteeing a significantly lower voter turnout -- although only a few states hold the primary and general election in March and April as Missouri law requires Ferguson to do. It's not that Ferguson is so different than towns across America. It's precisely because Ferguson holds up a mirror to flaws in our democratic system of government in towns across this country that the stakes are so high. Ferguson residents now have the opportunity to begin a movement for change in the other 89 jurisdictions in St. Louis County plagued by similar governance flaws, including those towns led by African-Americans. And Ferguson's example should provoke self-examination in working class suburbs across the country, where the power and effectiveness of weak elected local government is inadequate to meet the needs of the population. Change is coming to Ferguson. But the scope and breadth of that change will depend upon the ambition and discipline of activists and residents, whose passion and tenacity have already transformed the trajectory of leadership in a typical American town.",

        "article": "Congratulations to Australia for seeing sense and dropping the ridiculous policy of not selecting their best players if they are playing overseas. It leaves England looking old-fashioned and they need to react. Stuart Lancaster must be free to pick his best players, no matter where in the world they ply their trade. If Roy Hodgson\u2019s star names moved to Bayern Munich or Barcelona, would the FA tell him not to pick them? Absolutely not. The same needs to apply to rugby. Matt Giteau's stellar displays for Toulon have put him back on the Wallabies radar ahead of the World Cup . The game is changing and Australia have realised that. Matt Giteau and Drew Mitchell, for example, are top-class performers for Toulon and if England lose to Australia with those two playing out of their skins, you know exactly what the headlines will be. The World Cup is simply about the world\u2019s best coming together and ridiculous rules like this demean it. Toulon\u2019s Steffon Armitage came off the bench against Leinster on Sunday and turned the game on its head. His turnover work and ball-carrying are second to none and since he upped sticks to France his game has constantly improved. Toulon's Steffon Armitage takes on the Leinster defence during the Champions Cup semi-final in Marseille . I don\u2019t think Armitage would be playing this well if he was still at London Irish. He took a big risk and it paid off, he shouldn\u2019t be penalised for it. If one or two England back-rowers wouldn\u2019t want to see Armitage in the squad, then that confirms he should be! Nick Abendanon has also become better since he crossed the Channel. It\u2019s simply wrong to say England are best served by players at English clubs. If someone is going to be happier, healthier and a better player overseas, he should be supported. Jonny Wilkinson moved to France and became even better than when he played for England, so that completes the argument for me. Would I have picked Jonny if he was playing in France? Of course I would. Nick Abendanon's game has drastically improved since the former Bath full back made the move to France . As England coach you will be judged on your World Cup performance, even more so as the home team. That\u2019s where you have to deliver the results and selecting your best starting XV is the first thing you have to get right, without exception. When it comes to the big games, the other England players will want to have the best possible squad available. Every player, fan and Englishman wants England to win the World Cup and it starts with picking your best team. When it comes to a home World Cup, you don\u2019t want to be left talking about \u2018what ifs\u2019. England head coach Stuart Lancaster has remained steadfast in his policy not to select overseas players . England players deserve to go on to the field knowing they have been given the best chance of winning. Do the squad truly believe this when such talented players are not considered? They shouldn\u2019t be left to doubt they are playing only because of their home address. This isn\u2019t about being disloyal to the clubs. They benefit from a winning England team, especially in a World Cup year. You simply can\u2019t let the RFU or Premier Rugby tie your hands behind your back and dictate who you can or can\u2019t pick. At Toulon, they\u2019ve got Bryan Habana playing for South Africa and Leigh Halfpenny playing for Wales. They\u2019re among the best players in the world. It\u2019s just crazy and misguided not to make any Englishman available for selection. Well done, Australia. Bryan Habana plays for Toulon but the Springboks have continued to select the winger for Test matches .",

All this for free. Scroll down for video . Scott Keyes (above), a 28-year-old writer for Think Progress, is about to travel 20,000miles on 21 flights .

Berlin - Chicago, 4412 miles . Chicago - Dayton, 240 miles . Total: 20205 miles . Keyes decided to plan his trip when he realized he had some free time between his departure from Oaxaca, Mexico, where he has lived for the past year, to return home to the United States and get back to full time work. So he rounded up all his airline miles, and the points he had acquired on his 25 credit cards. In the end, he was able to book a vacation with stops in\u00a0Mexico, Nicaragua, Trinidad, St. Lucia, Grenada, Germany, Czech Republic, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Greece, Macedonia, Lithuania, and Finland without having to pay more than a few dollars on any of the flights. He will also be in the United States a few times, but just to catch connection flights. In the end he spent somewhere between 10 and 15 hours putting the entire trip together, which also includes free hotels, at a cost of 136,500 frequent flyer miles. 'It\u2019s tough when you have a job and you have to ask your boss for time off,' Keyes told Business Insider. 'You only have a limited time off and then you spend a lot of that traveling. I figured while I\u2019m in a position where I don\u2019t have a 9-to-5, I might as well take advantage.' In fact, Keyes is such a pro at travelling on the extremely cheap that he even wrote two eBooks detailing his strategies: How to Fly for Free and How to Find Free Flights. And the easiest way is a bit more obvious than many might think. 'If your ultimate goal is to be able to find as cheap a flight as possible and go somewhere cool for not much money then starting with an open, blank slate and going wherever there\u2019s a cheap flight right now is going to be your best bet,' said Keyes. The young man posts photos from his trips on his Instagram account . Keyes is seen posing in front of the famed Materhorn on a previous trip, which straddles the border of Switzerland and Italy . Striking up a pose: Keyes at a Mexican wrestling match (left) and enjoying a hike (right) Keyes poses while rafting down Sumidero Canyon which is located near\u00a0the city of Chiapa de Corzo in Mexico .

This strategy has certainly worked for the young man as he has logged an impressive 354,000 miles in the sky while visiting 30 countries over the course of his lifetime. This next trip will increase that number to 42 countries. 'Just gonna go to the market for a pig's head': Keyes at a Mexican butcher shop (left) and camping on the beach (right) in Hawaii . Those credit cards meanwhile come in handy during those long layovers thanks to the access they provide to private lounges were travelers like Keyes can enjoy free food and drinks, hop online and even grab a quick shower. 'I\u2019ve got a nice work space, food, drinks, some Wi-Fi. This is like this whole other world,' said Keyes during a layover in Dallas, Texas as he sat in the American Express lounge. Even better, Keyes explains that the more you look for discounts, the better you become a finding and anticipating airline deals. 'It\u2019s not necessarily easy or intuitive for beginners,' he said. 'But the good news is that because if you do a little bit of leg work \u2014 learn how to get a few miles and how to use them well \u2014 you can start to travel really, really well.'",

        "article": "In the midst of the family's fighting and different claims, Bobby Brown has made a bold move. According to a Saturday report by NBC affiliate 11Alive, the 46-year-old singer has filed for guardianship over daughter Bobbi Kristina's estate. This news comes just days after the 22-year-old's loved ones were split over whether she had awoken from her coma as her father had claimed. Scroll down for video . Bold move: Bobby Brown has filed for guardianship over daughter Bobbi Kristina's estate according to a Saturday report from NBC affiliate 11Alive . Bobby was spotted earlier this week spending time at the DeKalb Medical Center in Decatur, Georgia, where his daughter is being cared for. The daughter of Whitney Houston was recently moved from Emory University Hospital - where she had been treated since being found unresponsive on January 31 - so she could be provided with long term care. While over the weekend Bobby claimed his daughter was awake, her maternal grandmother Cissy Houston clarified to\u00a0People\u00a0on Monday that her granddaughter 'is no longer in a medically induced coma' but is not awake nor expected to ever fully recover. Fight for her life: The 22-year-old was found unconscious on January 31 (pictured in October 2012) Bobby, shocked fans on Saturday by revealing that 'Bobbi is awake,' during a Dallas concert last Saturday. And on Monday, the former New Edition hitmaker released an official statement about his child writing: 'Bobbi Kristina's condition has changed and there has been improvement.' While Bobby remains adamant his daughter is awake, his ex-wife's 81-year-old mother has insisted her one time son-in-law is being far too optimistic, saying that even though Bobbi is no longer in a coma, she is irreversibly brain damaged and said that only a miracle could save her. In a new statement, Cissy said: 'I have just returned from visiting my granddaughter Bobbi Kristina in the hospital and while she is no longer in a medically induced coma, she has a tracheotomy and according to the doctors she has global and irreversible brain damage and remains unresponsive. Family bonds: The 46-year-old singer recently claimed at his concert last Saturday that his daughter - pictured together in an Instagram from Bobbi in June of last year - was 'awake' 'Meeting with the doctors and understanding that she can live in this condition for a lifetime truly saddens me. 'We can only trust in God for a miracle at this time. Keep us in your prayers.' A family source told TMZ: 'They have no idea where Bobby Brown is getting his information that Bobbi Kristina is awake, not do they know why Tina said she's awake and no longer on life support.' The other side: Bobbi's grandmother Cissy Houston (pictured in June 2012) said that her granddaughter is not awake but is 'is no longer in a medically induced coma but has global and irreversible brain damage and remains unresponsive' Sad update:\u00a0'Meeting with the doctors and understanding that she can live in this condition for a lifetime truly saddens me' (pictured in April 2013) Bobby's lawyer Christopher Brown said in a statement: 'Bobbi Kristina\u2019s condition has changed since moving from Emory University Hospital and there has been improvement. Doctors have indicated that she will have a long life. 'However, Bobbi Kristina is presently embarking on a rehabilitation process and the quality of her life will not be known for years to come.\u00a0We thank everyone that supports Bobbi Kristina and God is hearing our prayers.' On Monday, Bobby's second wife Alicia Etheredge-Brown - who is currently pregnant with the couple's second child - also released a statement about Bobbi Kristina. By her side: The 46-year-old singer and his second wife Alicia Etheredge-Brown released official statements about Bobbi Kristina on Monday (pictured together leaving\u00a0Emory University hospital on February 6) 'My husband made an attempt to correct the negative comments he must endure on a daily basis from both family and the public regarding his daughter\u2019s medical condition. He is encouraged by the steps that Bobbi Kristina has made since her hospitalization on January 31, 2015. 'She has made it out of ICU, opened her eyes, and started a rehabilitation that will be long and hard. We will hold on to all the blessings GOD gives us to help her at this time and we look forward to her having a relationship with her unborn sister as our family grows in love and faith.' Adding: 'I just wish my husband could deal with this most painful and difficult time with people surrounding him who fully support and pray for Bobbi Kristina\u2019s recovery and only her recovery. Life is the most precious thing that we all have.' 'My husband made an attempt to correct the negative comments':\u00a0Alicia - who is currently pregnant with the couple's second child - tried to clarify Bobby's statements (pictured April 16) Brown family:\u00a0Bobbi Kristina's aunt Tina Brown took to her Facebook page echoing a similar statement of Bobby's on Saturday, that has since been taken down .

        "article": "(CNN)The outlines of a nuclear deal with Iran are in place. Unfortunately, it seems like too many in President Barack Obama's administration have forgotten that the only reason this terrorist-supporting state came to the negotiating table in the first place was because of tough sanctions imposed by the U.S. Congress. Indeed, the reality is that President Obama is giving up enormous leverage in his nuclear deal with Iran -- and I worry we will lose it for good. Bleeding money, and faced with falling oil prices, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei gave his government rare permission to bargain with the \"Great Satan\" -- the United States. But just as U.S. and European sanctions were forcing Iran to the nuclear crossroads, President Obama has given Tehran an easy exit. For Khamenei, the \"framework\" announced last week looks like a win-win: He gets to keep his nuclear infrastructure, and in return gets billions of dollars in sanctions relief. Congress offered a better strategy when the top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Committee, Eliot Engel, and I introduced a bill to hit Tehran with its toughest sanctions yet. Unfortunately, this bill -- which passed the House in a 400-20 vote -- was blocked in the Senate last year, despite the fact that it would have sharpened the Ayatollah's choice: Dismantle your nuclear weapons program or see your economy collapse. President Obama once had a tougher line, when in 2012 he said: \"The deal we'll accept is they end their nuclear program. It's very straightforward.\" But the framework announced last week does nothing of the sort. Negotiated between Iran and the United States, Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany, the framework concedes that Iran can maintain \"a mutually defined enrichment program,\" operate thousands of centrifuges, and continue its research and development of nuclear technologies. The deal currently on the table would hand Tehran billions of previously sanctioned funds, filling the coffers of the world's biggest state sponsor of terrorism, with strongholds in Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Lebanon. Meanwhile, the strictest restrictions on Iran's enrichment will expire in only 10 years, despite the President receiving a letter from 367 Members of Congress -- both Democrats and Republicans -- in which we insisted that \"verifiable constraints on Iran's nuclear program must last for decades.\" The President admitted as much when he conceded that \"in year 13, 14, 15, they have advanced centrifuges that enrich uranium fairly rapidly, and at that point the breakout times would have shrunk almost down to zero.\" But as bad as these concessions are, the most concerning aspect of the April 2 deal is that it lacks tough safeguards to stop Iran from cheating. The key question is this: Will the inspectors at the International Atomic Energy Agency be allowed to inspect these military sites without warning? Because if the IAEA cannot conduct \"anytime, anywhere\" inspections, Iran will be able to \"sneak out\" to a bomb. It has been done before. Remember, in 1994, when President Bill Clinton told us he had struck a deal with North Korea that would \"make the United States, the Korean Peninsula, and the world safer\"? President Clinton sounded a little too much like the current Secretary of State John Kerry, when he promised that the North Korea agreement \"does not rely on trust\" and that \"compliance will be certified by the International Atomic Energy Agency.\" Twelve years after these assurances, North Korea detonated its first nuclear bomb. Iran could easily do the same. The best predictor of its future behavior is its past behavior -- between 2004 and 2009, the Iranian government built a huge centrifuge facility named Fordo under a mountain deep in the Iranian desert. Luckily for the world, Western intelligence agencies discovered Tehran's deception. But we cannot rely on such luck in the future, particularly when Iran still hasn't come clean about its history of secret weapons development and is still dodging basic questions from the IAEA. Let's not forget the other things Iran has been doing while its diplomats have been bargaining with the U.S. and its partners. While Iran was showing its friendly new face to the world, it has simultaneously been helping Syrian dictator Bashar al Assad kill his own people, training and funding the terrorist group Hezbollah, which aims to annihilate Israel, and supporting the Houthis, who started a civil war and overthrew the government in Yemen -- one of America's more reliable counterterrorism partners in the region. If President Obama is going to hand over billions of dollars to a regime that behaves like this, run by a man who publicly declares: \"Death to America,\" it has to be a better deal. The framework we have before us keeps Iran's nuclear door well and truly open.",

        "article": "Arsene Wenger insists his woeful record against Jose Mourinho will have no bearing on Arsenal's top-of-the-table clash with Chelsea at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday. Wenger has failed to win in 12 games against Mourinho across the Portuguese coach's two spells at Stamford Bridge, drawing five and losing seven of their clashes. But the Arsenal manager says the past shared between the two managers on the touchline in Sunday's 4pm kick-off will be irrelevant as the Barclays Premier League's top two sides face off. Arsene Wenger has drawn five and lost seven of his 12 clashes with Jose Mourinho ahead of facing Chelsea . Wenger and Mourinho rowed on the touchline in October's 2-0 win for Chelsea in the reverse fixture . 'I think we have not always lost in 12 attempts. We have been close,' Wenger said. 'Having said that, the result on Sunday will just be down to the performance on the day. We are on a good run and we have an opportunity at home to beat them and we want to take it. 'We have a good run of form and good belief and solidarity. We have passed many tests recently when we were questioned. We have another test on Sunday that we want to pass. 'Chelsea's strengths are they have been very efficient on counter attacks and set-pieces as well. We have to nullify their strengths.' Asked about his frosty relationship with Mourinho, Wenger said: 'I do not want to talk about that. What is interesting for people is when the game starts at 4pm we have a great game. It is not about the relationship between the managers.' The managers of London's two biggest clubs have long had a frosty relationship in the opposing dugouts . Cesc Fabregas set up Diego Costa to seal a 2-0 victory for Chelsea against Arsenal earlier this season . Arsenal are 10 points behind Chelsea but come into the game on the back of excellent form. Wenger said: 'Look, mathematically it will be possible, yes, but Chelsea has their future and the championship in their hands. We can get closer and we have an opportunity to do that at home and want to take it.' Wenger added: 'They have been very consistent until now. They have fewer losses than any team. The Premier League rewards consistency. On that front they gave been defensively very strong and consistent.' Fabregas gets ahead of his now-team-mate Branislav Ivanovic to score against Chelsea for Arsenal in 2010 . Sunday's game marks the return of former Arsenal midfielder Cesc Fabregas, who will be wearing Chelsea blue at the Emirates for the first time. Fabregas left for Barcelona in 2011. Arsenal supporters are expected to give their former hero a hot reception after he joined their fierce rivals, but Wenger has asked for some respect for one of their best players of the last decade. 'I want every player to be respected, and Cesc Fabregas when he comes to the Emirates on Sunday to be respected like he deserves,' he said. Asked if he regretted not signing Fabregas in the summer when he had the option to, Wenger added: 'The regret I have is that he wanted to leave here. 'This club and myself had a very positive influence on Cesc\u2019s life, so I would be a bit uncomfortable to have to justify today why he is not here. I believe I would rather it was the other way around.'

        "article": "(CNN)As Americans mark the 150th anniversary of Abraham Lincoln's death this week, let us remember that he not only belongs to the ages, but also belongs, in a special way, to Illinois. Lincoln's two greatest legacies -- indivisible union and irreversible emancipation -- grew organically from his Midwestern roots. He knew firsthand that no defensible border shielded the land of corn from the land of cotton. The entire region from the Appalachians to the Rockies drained through the Mississippi River, enabling farmers in this vast basin to float their goods down to market through New Orleans and from there to the world. He thus could never allow a potentially hostile power to control this geostrategic chokepoint in particular, or Dixie more generally. The U.S. landmass, he insisted, \"is  well adapted to be the home of one national family; and it is not well adapted for two, or more\" because \"there is no line, straight or crooked, suitable for a national boundary upon which to divide.\" Lincoln supplemented his Midwestern geography lesson with a distinctly Midwestern claim about constitutional history: \"The Union is older than any of the States; and in fact, it created them as States.\" Lincoln did not need to make this controversial claim to prove his case, and elsewhere he stressed the decisive legal point that the Constitution's text clearly prohibits unilateral secession. The Constitution is always and everywhere the supreme law of the land -- no matter what an individual state says. But Lincoln's additional assertion that the Union created the states, not vice versa, provoked strong disagreement in other parts of the country. Most Virginians, including Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee, insisted that of course Virginia had come first!  At the outbreak of the American Revolution, the Old Dominion was already a century and a half old. Generations of Lees had helped govern Virginia long before the United States was born. But if Lee was, first and always, a Virginian, Lincoln was an American. His father came from Virginia, his grandfather hailed from Pennsylvania, and before that, the family had probably lived in New England. Abe himself had been born in Kentucky and had moved as a boy to Indiana, and later, as a young man, to Illinois. These latter two Midwestern states had undeniably been formed by the Union itself. These places had begun as federal territory -- the common inheritance of all Americans -- and it was the federal government that had indeed brought these new states to life. When young Abe moved to Indiana, it was just becoming a state, thanks to federal governmental action. It was a wise set of federal policies -- proper land surveys and a commitment to public education -- that had drawn the Lincolns and countless other Kentuckians to leave the Bluegrass State for a brighter future in the Midwest. Retracing Lincoln's assassination 150 years later . That brighter future also involved freedom from slavery. The Old Northwest had always been free soil, as provided for by a Northwest Ordinance that predated the U.S. Constitution.  The words of the 13th  Amendment -- the only constitutional amendment that Lincoln would live to sign -- promised to end slavery everywhere in America and did so by borrowing verbatim from Article 6 of the Northwest Ordinance. True, geography is not inexorable destiny. Many other Midwesterners in Lincoln's era embraced slavery and secession. Hugo Black, the Supreme Court justice who did the most to make Lincoln's constitutional vision a reality over the next century, was born and raised in Alabama. But geographic variation has always been a large part of America's constitutional saga. In the 1860 election that brought him to power, Lincoln swept almost all the Northern states, but did miserably in the slaveholding south. John Wilkes Booth, the dastard who ended Lincoln's life 150 years ago this week, was an embittered extremist from a slave state. So was Lincoln's nemesis on the Supreme Court, Chief Justice Roger Taney. Taney's most infamous ruling, the pro-slavery Dred Scott decision in 1857, had emerged from a court dominated by the South; although slave states accounted for less a third of America's free population, this region held an absolute majority of the seats on the court. Remembering Lincoln's murder . In our era, given the fact that Republican appointees have held a majority of the court for the last 40 years, the court has been rather moderate. Much of this moderation has come courtesy of northern Republicans on the Court -- most notably, Minnesota's Harry Blackmun, Illinois' John Paul Stevens, and New Hampshire's David Souter. All nine of the current justices learned their law in liberal New England, at Harvard or Yale, and the Republican appointee most attentive to gay rights, Anthony Kennedy, grew up in northern California, a corner of the country renowned for its respect for alternative lifestyles. Which takes us back to Lincoln. When Anthony Kennedy was a lad in California's state capital, the governor, a friend of the Kennedy family, was a Lincoln Republican named Earl Warren -- a man who would later author the Court's iconic opinion in Brown v. Board of Education, vindicating the constitutional amendments enshrined by Lincoln and his allies. Today, both parties at their best claim Lincoln. Jeb Bush aims to appeal to the better angels of our nature and Rand Paul is a Kentuckian who professes interest in racial outreach. Hillary Clinton was born an Illinois Republican. And the leader of her adopted political party -- who also happens to be president -- is a lanky and brainy lawyer from Illinois who knows how to give a good speech, and who swept to power in 2008 by recreating Lincoln's geographic coalition, winning every state within a four-hour drive of Chicago. In the largest sense, then, all Americans, of both parties and all regions -- whether or not they have ever set foot in Illinois -- are living in the Land of Lincoln.",

        "article": "Experts have discovered that this dove grey suit was once worn by notorious Nazi leader Hermann Goering. They used sweat stains on the uniform to link it to the overweight German commander and it is now expected to fetch \u00a385,000 when it goes under the hammer in Plymouth, Devon. Goering, who founded the Gestapo and was commander of the German air force, was well known for being overweight and as a result the suit shows the strain of being worn by the large officer. It was originally believed to be a replica, but the careful examination of the sweat blemishes and fraying on the buttons and buckles led experts to believe it had been worn. The dove grey suit made by a Viennese tailor that was once worn by ruthless Nazi commander Hermann Goering . Hermann Goering, pictured in his full military dress during World War Two, favoured a dove grey suit . John Cabello, owner of Devon-Parade Antiques, where the uniform is being sold, said the wear and tear on the uniform helped them identify Goering as its original owner. He said: 'Goering was hugely overweight and had a tendency to sweat a lot, that would explain the profusion of sweat in the tunic. 'The stress levels on the tunic's folds coupled with the strain on the broaches of the tunic show it was worn by someone overweight. 'This also proves it was worn for a long, long time by someone who was fat enough to cause it to stretch and wear over a period of time. 'He also had a habit when he used to walk around talking to people of putting his left hand into his left pocket. Because of this the wear on the left pocket is substantially more than the right.' The outfit was made by the Viennese tailor, Tiller, who was known to have made uniforms for the Nazis during the war. Stress levels on the tunic's folds coupled with the strain on the broaches of the tunic show it was worn by someone overweight . The uniform was believed to have been liberated by the Americans before it found its way into a collection in Switzerland . The outfit was made by the Viennese tailor, Tiller, who was known to have made uniforms for the Nazis during the war . Although the tailoring of dove grey blue ensemble is very good, the materials used are of remarkably lower quality when compared to the uniforms worn by Nazi officers at the beginning of the war. Mr Cabello, from Plymouth, Devon, said: 'As the war progressed, it got harder to get materials and quality everywhere went down. 'There was also an effort by Goering to appear less grand during the latter part of the war. This is because as he was going around meeting the population, if he looks like he is living in opulence when they are in poverty it would not go down well.' Goering, pictured above, saw himself as Hitler's successor and was known to have been ill for much of the war . Air Force chief Hermann Goering pictured with Adolf Hitler by the Nazi leader's train during the war . Mr Cabello bought the uniform at auction from a private museum in Switzerland, and at the time it was believed to have been a copy of Goering's uniform that would have been used only as a display model and not actually worn by Goering. It was not until Mr Cabello began looking at the tunic and trousers in detail that he realised there were too many aspects of the uniform that could only have been caused by being worn by the Nazi himself. The son of a judge Hermann Goering was born in Germany in 1893. He fought in the air force during World War One and at the end of the conflict was recognised as a  hero. Goering became a leading figure in the Nazi party and was awarded a high position in Hitler's Government after he became Chancellor in 1933. He went on to play a key role in establishing the Gestapo and created early concentration camps for political opponents of Hitler. In 1935 he became commander in chief of the luftwaffe and held the post until the final days of the war. After learning that Hitler intended to commit suicide \u00a0in 1945 he sent Hitler a telegram asking if he could assume control after his death. He was removed from his position, expelled from the party and arrested. Goering was indicted by the International Military Tribunal in Nuremberg in 1946. Goering was found guilty of war crimes and sentenced to death by hanging. Ahead of his execution he took cyanide and died. Mr Cabello said: 'We had it looked at by several people who deal in uniforms and the general consensus is the fact that it is old and has definitely been worn. 'We don't know the origin of the uniform. We assume it was liberated by the Americans and the local population and found its way into a collection in Switzerland.' The uniform is being sold as a set which includes the original tunic, trousers and braces worn by Goering as well as a replica peaked cap and an original Nazi general's belt that would not have been owned by the Nazi commander. It is being sold by Parade Antiques in Plymouth, Devon . An overweight Hermann Goering, in one of his grander suits, \u00a0arriving at the Bayreuth Festival with Frau Winifred Wagner .

        "article": "Lord Stevens is to be investigated over hotly disputed allegations of a cover-up of police corruption in the bungled Step-hen Lawrence murder probe. Last night the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said it will investigate claims that the former Met chief failed to hand over key information to the Macpherson Inquiry regarding the black teenager\u2019s race hate killing. The watchdog probe stems from a complaint from Stephen\u2019s father Neville Lawrence. Lord Stevens was deputy commissioner of the Metropolitan Police from 1998 to 2000 \u2013 while the Macpherson Inquiry report was being compiled \u2013 before serving five years as the UK\u2019s most senior policeman. 'Cover-up':\u00a0Former Met Police commissioner Lord Stevens (left) is to be investigated into allegations of a cover-up over the Stephen Lawrence murder probe in the nineties . Sparked new investigation: Neville Lawrence, the father of murdered Stephen Lawrence, made a complaint last October about the failure of senior officers during the Macpherson Inquiry . The complaint concerns a letter to the Macpherson Inquiry in 1998, in which Lord Stevens stated that no officer or former officer involved in giving evidence was under investigation for corruption. It is alleged that the letter included misleading information. However, last night sources close to the former Scotland Yard commissioner said he was vindicated last year by Mark Ellison QC, the author of an official report into the Lawrence corruption allegations. A source said: \u2018Any suggestion that anyone from the Met would seek to withhold the truth from the Macpherson Inquiry at that time is completely untrue. Last year Mark Ellison wrote to Lord Stevens to say he had done nothing wrong.\u2019 Last night, Channel 4 News \u2013 which revealed details of the IPCC probe into Lord Stevens \u2013 quoted him as saying: \u2018Step very carefully, I\u2019m not putting up with any more c**p about this.\u2019 Quoting from a letter he received from Mr Ellison, Lord Stevens was reported to have said: \u2018No one is suggesting that you did anything that was culpable in any way.\u2019 Baroness Lawrence, pictured taking her seat in the House of Lords in 2013, described undercover police officers as 'disgraceful' following the findings of the Ellison review last year . The IPCC said: \u2018We can confirm we are independently investigating Lord Stevens following a referral from the Metropolitan Police.\u2019 The Met said that after it received \u2018a public complaint in relation to Lord Stevens\u2019 it made a referral to the IPCC last November. The Met\u2019s statement added: \u2018The complaint has been made in relation to Lord Stevens\u2019s role as the then deputy commissioner and disclosure to the Macpherson Inquiry. Facing probe: Lord Stevens pictured in 2001 alongside Neville Lawrence, whose complaint has sparked the latest investigation . \u2018This issue was raised in the Stephen Lawrence Independent Review by Mark Ellison QC, where he concluded there were defects in the level of information that the Metropolitan Police revealed to the inquiry.\u2019 Mr Lawrence had asked the IPCC to look into alleged failures of senior officers, including Lord Stevens, to provide \u2018full, frank and truthful\u2019 information to the inquiry as well as claims that hundreds of files on past major police corruption probes were shredded. He welcomed the IPCC\u2019s decision to investigate, telling Channel 4 News: \u2018I\u2019m hoping that this time they\u2019re going to come back with a result that can help us to get further into the truth of what was happening during the investigation into Stephen\u2019s death.\u2019 It took more than 18 years to bring two of Stephen\u2019s killers \u2013 Gary Dobson and David Norris \u2013 to justice and they were jailed for life in 2012. Also that year, Home Secretary Theresa May commissioned Mr Ellison QC to lead an independent review into whether there was evidence of corruption in the original Lawrence investigation, and whether evidence had been withheld from the Macpherson Inquiry. Last year she told Parliament that there were \u2018serious concerns that\u2026 relevant material which would show corruption has not been revealed because it cannot be found or has been destroyed\u2019. When the Ellison review reported last year it said one former detective, John Davidson, was suspected of corruption in the Lawrence case, in which he had a key role. Mr Davidson has always denied the claims. Long battle for justice: Stephen's mother Doreen, now Baroness Lawrence, and father Neville have been campaigning for more than 20 years . The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge meet with Baroness Lawrence, Stephen's mother, at\u00a0the Stephen Lawrence Centre last month . Damning: In his 1999 report William Macpherson accused\u00a0the Met Police of being institutionally racist . In 1998, five years after Stephen Lawrence was murdered in south east London, retired High Court judge Sir William Macpherson was appointed to head an inquiry into the killing. Macpherson led the review into the conduct of the Metropolitan Police during the murder investigation after the police's initial failure to apprehend the black teenager's killers. In his report, published in February 1999, Macpherson accused the Met of being institutionally racist but concluded that police corruption had not thwarted the case. However, he widely criticised the force's handling of the Lawrence case and said police did not carry out the investigation in an appropriate manner. He made over 70 recommendations, including to extend the number of offences classified as racist, make the police subject to greater public control and protect the rights for victims of crime. He also recommended that police forces increase the number of black and Asian officers, prompting the Government to pledge to increase the number of officers from minority ethnic groups from 2,500 to 8,000 by 2009. And he recommended that the double jeopardy rule should be abrogated in murder cases to allow a retrial upon new and compelling evidence \u2013 something which became the law in 2005 with the passage of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. The Macpherson Report was dubbed 'one of the most important moments in the modern history of criminal justice in Britain' and credited with improving police attitudes to racism. Jack Straw, who was the Home Secretary from 1997 to 2001 during the time of the report, has previously declared that ordering the inquiry was 'the single most important decision I made as Home Secretary'. However, Home Secretary Theresa May expressed concerns in 2012 that evidence may have been withheld from the 1999 inquiry. She commissioned Mark Ellison QC to lead an independent review into whether there was evidence of corruption in the original Lawrence investigation and last year told Parliament that there were 'serious concerns that\u2026relevant material which would show corruption has not been revealed because it cannot be found or has been destroyed.'

McIlroy's fourth place in the Masters is his best finish in seven appearances, while his 12 under par total was 12 shots better than last year and beat his previous best by eight shots. But the world number one never threatened to claim a first green jacket to become only the sixth player in history to win all four major titles and saw Spieth follow up his second place at Augusta 12 months ago with a record-breaking victory. Graeme McDowell watches his tee shot on the fourth hole at Augusta on Friday . Jordan Spieth wears his green jacket after a sensational victory at the Masters on Sunday . 'There are a lot of potential eras evolving,' McDowell said. 'Guys like Rickie Fowler and Dustin Johnson and Patrick Reed. I feel like the young blood is certainly strong here in the States as opposed to the rest of the world. I feel like they certainly have the young potential coming through and it's very good for the game. 'When you look at Ryder Cups I think it makes it very interesting for them. I think our nucleus remains the same going forward but they have a lot of potential young blood coming through which could really change the shape of their team. 'Jordan and Rory are very difficult to compare because they are so different. I think it's a good thing to see a guy coming through who is not Dustin or Rory, guys like that who are dominating with physicality. Spieth celebrates on the 18th green after sealing his maiden major at Augusta National . Rory McIlroy waves to the crowd by the 18th green as his bid to win all four major titles ended . 'We see a guy coming around who is average build, average size, hits it average distance. He's not short but he's not the longest player on the planet and he gets it done other ways. That's exciting.' Spieth was ranked 44th in driving distance with an average of 282 yards, with Johnson (315 yards) top and McIlroy seventh at 297 yards. 'Rory's comparable to Tiger but I don't think Jordan is necessarily comparable to Tiger because of the way he plays the game,' McDowell added.

The miniature chocolate amphibians, which weighed a plump 20g two years ago - before they dropped to 15g, will now weigh just 12g. The shrinking of one of Australia\u2019s most popular children\u2019s chocolates was not widely announced but was in fact spotted by a shop owner who stocks the treats, the Herald Sun reports. Cadbury\u2019s spokesman Julian Polachek said: \u2018We\u2019re making a change to the size of the product because of manufacturing cost increases that we can no longer absorb.\u2019 The Freddo\u2019s downsize is just the latest product to feel the pinch in the declining confectionery world. In February, chocolate lovers expressed their anger after Cadbury announced plans to reduce the size of their family blocks by \u2018one row\u2019 in a cost cutting deal. The best-selling blocks dropped from 220 grams to 200 grams. The Australasia managing director for Mondelez International, Cadbury\u2019s parent company, Amanda Banfield told the Financial Review: \u2018Clearly any chocolate lover is going to be a bit disappointed.\u2019 Anticipating a backlash, Ms Banfield explained the company had decided the shrink the family block because of \u2018unprecedented cost headwinds\u2019. She blamed the increased price of ingredients and rising packaging costs for the change. Cadbury still recommends the blocks are sold for $4.99 \u2013 a price which won\u2019t increase or decrease \u2013 but Ms Banfield highlighted that shops set the prices that they choose to sell the products at in store. Cadbury's parent company\u2019s profit before tax rose 46 per cent from $87 million to $127 million in 2013. Thousands of angry chocolate fans complained about the change on Cadbury\u2019s Facebook page.

You are plain greedy.\u2019 \u2018Good bye Cadbury it has been a fun ride, but when you make it not worth it and unaffordable and then lie pffft not worth wasting my money how much would it cost to change the size of the chocolate with new moulds smaller packaging lots of money I would assume. I'll just wait for the tim tams to go on sale,\u2019 Kirsty Logan commented. Nestle has sliced its Killer Python lolly in half in a bid to help Australians better manage their health . Cadbury chocolate produced for the Australian market is made in Claremont in Tasmania. A statement on the company\u2019s website read: \u2018Confectionery companies around the world are feeling the squeeze of increasing costs.\u00a0At Cadbury, we\u2019re feeling it too. We\u2019ve reached a point where we can no longer absorb these increasing costs into the price of our chocolate blocks.\u2019 In October last year, Cadbury rival Nestle sliced its Killer Python lolly in half in an apparent bid to help Australians better manage their health. The new 'treat size' Allen's Killer Python measures 21cm instead of 32.5cm and weighs 24g instead of 47g. Nestle has also reduced the size of Smarties 'fun size' boxes from 20g to 16g. The move is part of Nestle's efforts to help Australians improve their health by controlling the amount of food they eat - 'especially treats'. The company said the Killer Pythons still have the same 'recipe, taste and stretchiness' but the new size cuts the lolly's kilojoules from 630 to 336, meaning a 10-year-old can run it off in 30 minutes instead of one hour. Customers have expressed their outrage over the move but Nestle's General Manager of Confectionery, Martin Brown, said it was the 'right thing to do'. Nestle has also reduced the size of Smarties 'fun size' boxes from 20g to 16g . The new 'treat size' Allen's Killer Python measures 21cm instead of 32.5cm . 'I think lollies are just such a fun part of growing up and people have got a lot of passion for them, I really understand that, l used to love eating Killer Pythons as a kid,' Mr Brown told Daily Mail Australia. 'I can understand why there will be some disappointed Python fans, it's a short term sacrifice because it will upset customers and we'll sell less Pythons but it's the right thing to do for ongoing trust. 'This is a really important initiative for a product primarily eaten by kids, getting it at the right portion.' When Red Rock Deli chips dropped 20 grams from their packets the prize remained the same . The company said the new treat size Killer Pythons bags are the same price as the old ones, but have gone up in weight, so customers will be getting more lolly snakes in smaller portion sizes. The recommended retail price on individual Killer Pythons will be halved from $1 to 50 cents. In the past manufacturers have been called out for slashing product sizes while keeping the same packing and price. Red Rock Deli-Style potato chips were shrunk by 20 grams. And Choice spotted Oat Crisp Honey cereal packets were reduced by 14 per cent while maintaining similar packaging and that the price per 100 grams increased by 10 per cent.",

He built a human barbecue in his garden in Yunlong County in southwest China's Yunnan Province, which he lies on above a fire below, like a spit roast. Jia, who was diagnosed with blood cancer in 2013, has had a bone marrow transplant, costing \u00a355,000, which was funded by well-wishers. Coming from a family of poor farm workers, further hospital treatments have used up his remaining funds. Fire starter:\u00a0Jia Binhui collects sawdust, twigs and sticks to set a fire that he can lie above . Contraption: Jia lies on top of the wooden poles once the fire (right) has died down. He hopes temperatures above 42C will cure his cancer . Desperate bid: He hopes the scorching coals will cure his leukaemia cells after running out of money for hospital treatment . Jia wrote on his Weibo account: 'They say experts believe a temperature higher than 42 degrees Celsius can kill cancer cells, so I set up a contraption in my backyard to try. 'Let's see if it works.' Last month, Jia married his long-term girlfriend Liu Yuan and said he refuses to be defeated by the disease. The fire is made using sawdust, twigs and branches which he then lights and leaves to burn for several minutes for it to get hot enough. Determined:\u00a0Jia married his long-term girlfriend Liu Yuan last month and refuses to give up despite not being able to fund cancer treatment . Home hospital: Jia has built the device at his home in\u00a0southwest China's Yunnan Province in the hope it will cure his cancer . He then lies on top of the wooden poles for as long as he can physically take the roasting temperature. 'I've been told that it also works in water. But it's nearly impossible to keep water constantly at 42 degrees Celsius, so I'm using this method instead' he said. Jai added that he will continue using this unorthodox treatment before returning to the hospital to see if his condition has improved.",

        "article": "Andy Hornby is non-executive chairman of Pharmacy 2U, which was found to be selling NHS patients' details on without their knowledge . The chairman of the online pharmacy site found to be selling NHS patients\u2019 data without their knowledge is the shamed former chief executive of HBOS. A Mail investigation yesterday told how the personal details of thousands of users of Pharmacy 2U are being sold to companies that target the sick. Now we can reveal that at its helm is the disgraced banker Andy Hornby, who was in charge of HBOS when it collapsed in 2008. Mr Hornby last night faced calls to step down from his role as non-executive chairman of Pharmacy 2U and was condemned for profiting from the sale of his customers\u2019 personal data. Many of those whose details he is selling on are some of the most vulnerable in society \u2013 either too ill to travel to their nearest surgery or the disabled. Others who use the NHS-approved pharmacy website used its online doctor consultations. Their details \u2013 which included email addresses and dates of birth \u2013 were passed on without proper consent. When Mr Hornby joined the company, the UK\u2019s leading online pharmacy, in 2012, it said in a statement: \u2018The imminent transition to electronic prescriptions across the NHS represents an exciting opportunity for Pharmacy 2U, and Andy\u2019s insights and leadership will be of significant value.\u2019 It is not known how much Mr Hornby \u2013 who works two to three days a week \u2013 is earning from the Leeds-based company, but it is thought he received a significant salary increase last year. He is also a principle shareholder. Dr Sarah Wollaston, the outgoing Tory chairman of the Commons health select committee, last night called for Mr Hornby to step down and for a criminal investigation into Pharmacy 2U. She said: \u2018He should be called to account for what his company is doing and issue a public statement. He needs to be made to sit down and explain why patient information is being sold on.\u2019 She added that the health select committee should launch an inquiry into the issue after the election. Pharmacy 2U, an online prescription service, sold details including\u00a0the patients\u2019 email addresses, dates of birth and date of their last prescriptions to marketing firms . Many of those whose details he is selling on are some of the most vulnerable in society \u2013 either too ill to travel to their nearest surgery or the disabled . Following the financial crash in the autumn of 2008, a devastating report by the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards accused Mr Hornby and fellow former bosses of \u2018catastrophic failures\u2019 as they presided over years of reckless lending. His current role is his third job since then. In 2011 he unexpectedly quit as \u00a31million-a-year chief executive of healthcare group Alliance Boots, a move blamed on stress. Dr Sarah Wollaston, the outgoing Tory chairman of the Commons health select committee, called for Mr Hornby to step down . Four months later he became boss of Coral, a position he still holds. In 2013, he faced calls to quit amid reports the bookmaker was set for a \u00a32billion flotation. Pharmacy 2U admitted that it had sold the names and addresses of \u2018up to 5,000\u2019 patients to data company Alchemy Direct but refused to say how much it had charged. It said it had decided to stop selling the information to Alchemy and stressed no medical data had been passed on. Last night Pharmacy 2U said that Mr Hornby is \u2018not involved in day-to-day decisions about the running of the business\u2019. A spokesman added: \u2018We have asked the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office to work with us to review our privacy policy and have also contacted the General Pharmaceutical Council, our industry regulator, and the NHS, to discuss this matter.\u2019 NHS England said: \u2018Any breach of confidentiality is totally unacceptable. This case will be reported to the Information Commissioner and General Pharmaceutical Council and there will be an immediate investigation.\u2019",

In true non-nonsense style, Brand lables Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran's efforts to smuggle 8kg of heroin out of Indonesia as 'daft' as he urges his nine million Twitter followers to sign up to the petition in a desperate bid to spare their lives. While the pair await their fate on what is infamously dubbed as 'Execution Island' in Java, Brand posted that the Australians have already done a decade behind bars and did not deserve to face a firing squad. Scroll down for video . Outspoken British comedian Russell Brand has appealed to this fans to sign up to the mercy campaign to save condemned Bali Nine duo who from facing death row . Brand labels the pair's efforts to import 8kg of heroin as into Australia as 'daft drug smuggling' Andrew Chan (left) and Myruan Sukumaran (right)\u00a0await their fate on what is infamously dubbed as 'Execution Island' 'These Aussie blokes are going to be killed soon for a bit of daft drug smuggling (they've done 10 yrs already) HELP!' Brand tweeted. Brand also encouraged his fans to attend an exhibition of Sukumaran's work organised by his cousin who lives in London to be held at Amnesty International's London headquarters today - April 13. 'Come to this exhibition in East London next week - the artist is going to be executed in Indonesia in a month,' he tweeted. Sukumaran is  a talented artist who was mentored by well-known Australian artist Ben Quilty -who has also lead the charge in the mercy campaign to save the pair's lives. Painting has proven a great sense of solace for\u00a0Sukumaran over the past decade that he has spent in Kerobokan jail in Bali and has even run art classes for fellow inmates as part of the drug rehabilitation program that he set up with Chan. His cousin,\u00a0Niranjela Karunatilake, \u00a0last visited her cousin on death row in February. Sukumaran will turn 34 on Friday which is also exactly ten years since their arrest as a ringleader in the Bali Nine drug smuggling operation. Niranjela said it was: ' just too sad to think that could be his last birthday'. 'The death penalty is never the answer and I don't believe it deters crime, but in Myu's case, when he has done so much to repent and improve prison conditions, it would be a real tragedy if his life was cut short,' she said. 'We are not asking for Myu to be freed, all we ask is for mercy, that he keeps his life and continues his positive impact on the Indonesian prison system and other inmates.' Brand said the Australians have already done a decade behind bars and did not deserve to face a firing squad .

Sukumaran is a talented artist, who was mentored by well-known Australian artist Ben Quilty, and ran art classes for fellow inmates as part of the drug rehabilitation program that he set up with Chan in Kerobokan . After losing a bid to challenge their clemency rejections in the state administrative court last Monday and as Jakarta waits on the legal efforts of a few other prisoners before setting an execution date, the pair's Australian's lawyers sought a constitutional court review to make clear the president's obligations on considering clemency on Thursday - a process that could take several months. They also intend to challenge the barrier preventing foreign citizens from constitutional court appeals. However, Attorney-General HM Prasetyo has dismissed the challenge as delaying tactics and says he won't recognise it. Indonesian lawyer for the death row pair, Inneke Kusuma, told reporters the effort was not aimed at delaying the executions, but clarifying a prisoner's rights.",

The phone, which belonged to Bella Crooke from Melbourne, was handed in to Albury Police Station on the NSW-Victoria border on Sunday morning. Police officers on duty realised the phone was unlocked and used it to post selfies and photos of the phone in various locations around the police station on Bella's Facebook page. Officers from Albury Police Station on the NSW-Victoria border posted selfies on a woman's Facebook page saying she could come and collect her phone after it was handed in on Sunday morning . 'You should probably put a password on your phone,' a status post read alongside a selfie of a police officer. 'When you are ready to pick it up it will be at Albury police station.' Bella lost her phone at a friend's birthday party the night before and dialled her number as soon as she realised. 'A security guard picked up and said he'd leave it at the police station. I didn't get there until 1pm and had no idea what had been going on,' she told Daily Mail Australia. By the time Bella made it to the police station, the original post had already garnered a humorous response from her friends and officers. The phone belonged to Bella Crooke who lost it at a friend's birthday party on Saturday night . Police officers on duty realised the phone was unlocked and used it to post selfies and puns on the woman's Facebook page, including this photo of the phone in a holding 'cell' While waiting for Bella to collect her phone, police had used the time to post a picture of the handset in a holding cell and to reassure the owner that it was in safe hands. \"If your\u00a0worried about the battery going flat, don't. By the time you pick it up it will be fully 'charged',' the post read. 'It is a great 'cell' phone,\" another post read. A few hours later police added: 'The phone is still here. Ready to be released early for good behaviour. Just waiting on Bella to post bail.' Bella said she didn't even have to give her name when she eventually reclaimed her phone. The post was quickly shared by the woman's friends who labelled police 'legends' for their unusual approach to tracking down the phone's owner . Bella said she didn't even have to give her name when she eventually reclaimed her phone because officers recognised her from her Facebook page . 'They just recognised me. A few people popped their heads out and said 'Is that the girl with the phone?',' she said. 'They asked me I had seen Facebook, which I hadn't. I think they'd been waiting for me to come in all morning. 'He made me check it in front of me... to see my reaction. 'I couldn't stop laughing. The police were texting my friends back on my behalf with the same kind of humour.' Bella has since put a password on her phone. 'It's good humour and I'm just glad I got my phone back. Thank you to the boys in blue for returning the phone and having a good sense of humour.' A few hours later police confirmed the phone had not been claimed . Police even took to replying to text messages sent by friends asking if she had her phone back .",

Tensions have remained high at the Sugar Pine Mine near Medford after\u00a0the facility was served with a federal stop-work order. The owners summoned  armed guards from the conservative Oath Keepers activist network ahead of a major protest outside local offices of the Bureau of Land Management yesterday.

Protests: A Sugar Pine Miner supporter holds a anti-BLM sign at a rally outside the Bureau of Land Management's offices in Medford on Thursday . Ready to go: A member of the Oath Keepers is seen at the Sugar Pine Mine on Wednesday . Co-owner Rick Barclay acted after receiving a stop-work order last month when officials said they found equipment on site indicating operations inconsistent with standard mine development requirements. The miners have since appealed the order and spokesman, Kerby Jackson, confirmed paperwork had been filed to keep officials from 'burning or breaking anything' on the property - but gave no more details. The owners insist they want to avoid a high profile stand-off while BLM officials say they want to resolve the dispute peacefully.

        "article": "Burying the dead along with a human sacrifice was common in ancient Korea. But an unusual tomb dating to between the 5th and 6th century seems to hold the remains of two lovers, one of whom may have been killed so the pair could lie together for eternity. The skeletons were found on top of one another in the tomb from Korea\u2019s Silla Dynasty, leading some experts suggesting that the set-up could even have been designed to show two people having sex. An unusual tomb dating to between the 5th and 6th century seems to hold the remains of two lovers, one of whom may have been killed so the pair could lie together for eternity. Here, the bones of the two people can be seen on top of one another, leading some experts to suggest the set-up was designed to imitate sex . Archaeologists are almost certain that the tomb was intended for a noblewoman and believe that the man she is lying with may have been killed so he could be buried with her. The tomb is made of soil and stone and was discovered last December in Hwangnam-dong, a neighbourhood of Gyeongju City in South Korea,Korea Joongang Daily reported. It was the capital of ancient Silla for almost 1,000 years and is known for its intricate gold ornaments and Buddhist temples. The remains of the two people, including leg bones and teeth, were found in the main chamber of the tomb and are thought to have died between the ages of 20 and 30. Experts believe the tomb was intended for the woman, because her body is carefully positioned to face the sky and she was buried with gold earrings, indicating her high status. A belt, beaded necklace and jade green jewels were also found with her skeleton. It is not known whether she died naturally or was killed. Archaeologists are almost certain that the tomb was intended for a noblewoman and believe that the man she is lying with may have been killed so he could be buried with her. The position of the skeletons is shown above . It's thought that the tomb was intended for a noblewoman, based on the positioning of her skeleton and objects found with her body, such as gold earrings (pictured). In contrast, no precious possessions were found with the male body, leading experts to speculate that he was a human sacrifice and possibly, her lover . Both the woman and the man in the tomb are estimated to be between the ages of 20 and 30 when they died, or were killed. The woman is thought to have been a noblewoman, based on the fact that her body was positioned on its back in the tomb, and she was buried with precious items such as gold earrings and jade. A sword and horse harness was discovered in another room of the tomb, indicating she was used to riding a horse and carrying a weapon, which was not unusual during the Silla Dynasty, which sometimes had women rulers. The man would have been the woman's lover, servant or body guard and it is likely that he was killed to be buried with her. Human sacrifices were buried in tombs at the time so they could act as guards in the afterlife. But when males were killed, they were usually placed at the feet of the person whom the tomb was intended for, or outside the main chamber, indicating that the man was of special interest to the noblewoman. The fact that the bones lie on top of each other have  led experts to think that the couple were lovers. Some even say that their bodies were positioned to make it look like they were having sex. In contrast, the man is believed to be a human sacrifice and his bones are positioned on top of hers. While male sacrifices were rare but not unheard of at the time, the set up in tomb is thought to be unique. Silla history expert, Professor Lee Han-sang of Daejeon University, told\u00a0The Chosun Ilbo: \u2018The man could have been a servant, bodyguard or lover\u2019. \u2018The discovery is important because it shows an unknown type of burial of the living with the dead in the Silla period.\u2019 Kim Kwon-il, a researcher at The Foundation of Silla Cultural Heritage Research, said: \u2018Male sacrifices were often buried in the room where the artefacts were, as guards, so to speak, for the dead.\u2019 In the Silla tomb, the position of the teeth indicate that the man and woman\u2019s heads laid next to each other. The only bodies previously found in main chambers, show that human sacrifices were often positioned at the feet of the person whom the tomb was intended for. Some historians believe that the couple were deliberately arranged to make it look as if they were having sex, Yonhap News Agency reported. The man\u2019s thigh bones were found on top of the woman\u2019s, indicating that they could have been locked in an embrace when they were buried. However, researchers at the foundation say that t's more likely that the man may have been buried on a wooden frame above her body, which decayed over time, so his bones became mingled with hers. Explicit clay dolls with large penises or breasts have previously been found and belong to the Silla, supporting some claims that the burial could have been posed to look sexual. In another room of the tomb, artefacts including a sword, harness and pottery was recovered, indicating that the woman probably rode horses and carried a weapon. No artefacts linked to the man were found, reinforcing the belief he was a sacrifice. Tombs from the early part of the Silla Dynasty are rare and just 24 are known to have been discovered. The tomb is made of soil and stone and was discovered in Hwangnam-dong (shown on the map with a red marker), a neighbourhood of Gyeongju City in South Korea, last December .",

'It is incredibly sad,' \u00a0Dyreparken's chief executive told Dagbladet.no. 'He was alive when our veterinarian came to the scene, but died while he tried to save him.' 'Melvin was gored right near his lungs and heart, and the injuries were so serious that they killed him,' veterinarian\u00a0Rolf Arne \u00d8lberg, who was called to the scene, said. Mr \u00d8lberg added that the two animals have been walking in the same enclosure since Melvin's birth in 2010 and has no idea why the antelope launched the deadly attack on the young giraffe.",

The violent conflict was captured by Queensland Police helicopter, and shows the a small scuffle escalate into an all-in fight as more teenagers, who had gathered at the Serbian Community Centre in Willawong, join in the fray. Police were called to disperse over 200 teenagers just before 10pm after members of the community centre unsuccessfully tried to break up the fight. Footage has emerged of a violent brawl between more than 70 teenagers outside a party in Brisbane . 'There were a lot of kids coming through and we wanted to call the police early because there were too many people coming in,' Dario Music, vice-president of the community centre, told Brisbane Times. The centre had originally been informed that approximately 30 people were attending an 18th birthday party of a woman who was not a part of the local Serbian community. 'Me and treasurer went and spoke to her and said, 'is this a birthday party or a Facebook party?,' Mr Music said. 'She said, 'no, we are just having a bit of fun', then about 40 or 50 people walked out in the car park and started punching on. There were bottles thrown and yelling and screaming. Initially there were about 40 or 50 then everyone else jumped in.' Mr Music said that rubbish, including broken bottles and shoes, was left in the car park, and that the incident had put an end to the Serbian community centre being hired out for events. The violent conflict was captured by Queensland Police helicopter, PolAir . Police were called to disperse over 200 teenagers just before 10pm after members of the community centre unsuccessfully tried to break up the fight . Police said that upon arrival, about 70 teenagers were involved in the violent brawl, and shut the event down without further disturbance. Neighbours said that 'hordes of people' were directed by police out of the area, reported The Courier Mail. Police were called to attend to related incidents nearby on King Road later in the evening.

        "article": "Hillsborough investigators have launched an appeal to track down  fans who tended to the wounded as they lay dying on the pitch at the 1989 disaster. Photographs which show the men and woman rushing towards those crushed in the tragedy have been released, with investigators urging anyone who recognises them to come forward. They form part of an ongoing Home Office inquiry aiming to establish whether any individual or organisation was to blame for the disaster which claimed the lives of 96 Liverpool fans. Issued on behalf of the Coroner Sir John Goldring, the people in the photographs may be able to tell victims' families' more about how they died, officials said. Investigators have released these images of football fans who were pictured carrying the wounded on stretchers and tending to others at the 1989 Hillsborough disaster . Police say the 'unusual' appeal \u00a0is necessary as those photographed may be able to answer questions of the victims' families . 'It is important to stress that we believe these people can help the Coroner\u2019s inquest process,' said Assistant Commissioner Jon Stoddart of Operation Resolve, the police force set up to look into the disaster. 'I know these pictures are 26 years old but if anyone does recognise the people we need to speak to then I would urge them to get in touch immediately. 'There are still many questions that the families of the 96 have and we believe that these people may be able to provide answers to some of those questions.' Ninety-six people died at the disaster after Liverpool fans in one section of the football grounds became crushed. Previous inquests which recorded conclusions of accidental death were thrown out at the High Court in 2012 after years of campaigning by the families of those killed. The Home Secretary Theresa May launched a fresh probe into the disaster the same year. Investigators hope members of the public may recognise some of those pictured in the appeal released today . While the images are 26 years old, investigators believe they may help track down key witnesses. Above, a man in a dark coloured jacket (left) and another in a beige jacket and grey hooded sweatshirt (right) who police believe may be able to help . Another of the fans in a distinctive white and red hat and a man seen tending to one of the wounded as they lay helpless on the football pitch (right) A man in a light denim jacket with long brown hair (left) is another person investigators believe may be able to help. Right, another person pictured in the appeal who was stuck behind the enclosure where fans were crushed . Another fan pictured in the appeal. Anyone with information about those pictured is urged to contact Operation Resolve officers . While officers said it was 'unusual' to carry out such appeals as today's while legal proceedings are active they invited anyone who recognised the people photographed to make contact. 'I have a team of highly trained staff in place who will deal with witnesses sensitively as we understand how difficult some people will find this,' added Mr Stoddart. 'The Operation Resolve website also contains useful contacts should members of the public require welfare assistance. 'It is unusual to carry out an appeal of this nature during an ongoing legal process such as the inquests and for that reason I urge people to remember the warning issued by the Coroner at the start of the fresh inquests, which he reiterated in February 2014. 'I also urge people to consider the advisory notice issued by the Attorney General\u2019s office on 10 March 2014. 'It is really important that people do not pass comment on our appeal or any other aspect of the Hillsborough disaster on social media and forums.' Among those to have already given evidence at the inquest in Warrington are the families of those killed and police officers working at the time. The inquest continues. Ninety-six people were killed in the 1989 disaster (above). The conclusions of previous inquests were thrown out in 2012 with the Home Office launching a fresh probe .

        "article": "The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have moved back to Kensington Palace to prepare for the imminent birth of their new baby, MailOnline can reveal today. The couple, whose second child is due on Saturday, returned to their London base, just a few minutes\u2019 drive from the private Lindo Wing at St Mary\u2019s, Paddington, on Sunday night after spending the weekend at Kate\u2019s family home in Berkshire, where they took a trip to their local farm park. The news came as Kensington Palace revealed William will enjoy what amounts to six weeks\u2019 paternity leave around the arrival of the new little prince or princess. Scroll down for video . Reunited: Prince William, pictured with his wife last month, has finished his air ambulance pilot training early so he is guaranteed to be with the Duchess of Cambridge when she goes into labour . Change: Until today the second in line to the throne, who is a trainee pilot with the East Anglia Air Ambulance in Norfolk, had been expected to still be working around the time his wife is expecting their new baby. A royal spokesman announced that the second in line to the throne had completed his latest stage of his training as a pilot with East Anglia Air Ambulance (EAAA) \u2018earlier than expected\u2019 - and would not be required to embark on the final stage until June 1. The future king had already announced that he planned to take two weeks\u2019 statutory paternity leave after the birth. With his enforced absence from work happily coinciding with the birth of his second child, William will now take the next month and a half off as unpaid leave, aides said, with immediate effect. Good timing?\u00a0Prince Harry, pictured in Australia, also announced today that he will be back in the UK to watch the London Marathon on Sunday, meaning he may also get to meet his future niece or nephew . The palace also announced that Prince Harry, who is currently on deployment with the Australian Army, will briefly return to the UK this weekend to present the winners\u2019 medals at Sunday\u2019s London Marathon and, if all goes to plan, meet his new niece or nephew. Harry \u2013 who is soon to drop down a place in the line of succession to fifth \u2013 is already travelling over to attend the Gallipoli Campaign centenary commemorations with his father, Prince Charles, on Thursday. The prince, who is patron of the London Marathon Charitable Trust, will return to Australia on Monday to continue his placement. The Mail understands that in recent days the Duchess, who carried out her last public engagement in March, has been taking her mind off the impending birth by spending a few days with her parents, Michael and Carole Middleton, at their sprawling Georgian mansion in Bucklebury, Berkshire. On Sunday she and Carole took her eldest son, Prince George, for a visit to nearby Bucklebury Farm Park where youngsters can meet a variety of animals from lambs to wild boar and enjoy a large outdoor playground. The little prince is a frequent visitor to the park with both his mother, nanny and grandmother. Kate appeared unbothered by her pregnancy, according to onlookers, as she carried and cuddled George, accompanied by a low-key Scotland Yard security detail. The family returned to London on Sunday night to make last minute preparations for the latest addition to their family, who will become fourth in line to the throne. In a statement today a Kensington Palace spokesman confirmed that William, who is employed by a private company, Bond Air Services, while working for the EAAA, had sailed through his initial training so quickly that he would now be able to be with his wife both before and after the birth. Plans: Kate plans deliver her child at the Lindo Wing, where the cost of giving birth naturally is up to \u00a310,000, and where their son George was July 2013 . They said: \u2018The Duke of Cambridge has completed the first phase of his in-work air ambulance helicopter pilot training with Bond Air Services earlier than anticipated. \u2018This is due to a combination of The Duke performing well in the various modules and having very good flying conditions that allowed flight training and assessment to progress more quickly than had been planned.\u2019 The Duke was the first member of the Royal Family to take advantage of statutory paternity leave, which was introduced in the UK in 2003. After the birth of his son George he took two weeks off while working on Anglesey. With his second child due on Saturday William will now be off work until June 1, although it will be unpaid, Palace sources say. Government rules state fathers are  paid \u00a3139.58-a-week for a maximum of two weeks. It is understood the Prince will not claim it. Fathers are entitled to two weeks paid paternity leave and up to 26 weeks\u2019 additional paid leave if the child\u2019s mother returns to work. The spokesman explained that given the lengthy gap between now and the final stage of his training, the prince has been on unpaid leave since Friday. He will undertake a handful of public engagements in late May, likely to include joining his grandmother, the Queen, at a Buckingham Palace garden party, before recommencing his training at the start of the following month. His spokesman added: \u2018His final block of in-work training requires an uninterrupted three week block of working time and the availability of the new EC145 helicopter that will be used for missions. This has always been scheduled to commence on 1st June, following a pre-planned period of official royal engagements in late May, details of which will be announced in due course. \u2018As he now will not have any further training to complete after returning from paternity leave, he will not return to duties with Bond until that time, and will remain on unpaid leave until then.\u2019 While it is unlikely the new little prince or princess will become monarch, it is not unheard of. The Queen\u2019s own father became George VI after the abdication of his elder brother, Edward VIII, over his love for American divorcee Wallis Simpson. The current monarch celebrated her 89th birthday quietly with her husband, Prince Philip, at Windsor Castle where she is holding Easter Court. Not only has she now entered her 90th remarkable year, but the Queen will soon also become the longest reigning monarch in British history.",

        "article": "Former first daughter Chelsea Clinton issued a pointed defense of her family foundation on Thursday after allegations surfaced that it reaped millions from foreign countries that had issues pending before her mother when she was secretary of state. 'What the Clinton Foundation has said is that we will be even more transparent' in the wake of the scandalous claims, said Chelsea, the philanthropy's vice chair, 'even though Transparency International and others have said we're among the most transparent of foundations.' Clinton, the daughter of former U.S. president Bill Clinton and presumptive Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton, spoke during an event on women and girls at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York City. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Chelsea Clinton defended her family philanthropy on Thursday in New York, calling it 'among the most transparent of foundations' The Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation is under fire for allegedly accepting millions from foreign entities in exchange for special favors from the State Department when Hillary Clinton was at its helm . Hillary Clinton (seen Wednesday at Georgetown University) was helping approve Russia's purchase of US uranium production as her foundation received millions from executives tied to the deal . ABC News\u00a0hosted the event, and reported that Chelsea outlined what she said is\u00a0'the right policy. That we'll be even more transparent. That to eliminate any questions while we're in this time, we won't take new government funding, but that the work will continue as it is.' The foundation recently committed to stop taking donations from foreign governments but insisted it wouldn't return money it has already collected. That hasn't sat well with Republicans vying for their party's presidential nomination: Hillary Clinton is Public Enemy Number One on the campaign trail, and they smell blood. 'Having raised tens of millions of dollars from foreign nations presents a clear conflict of interest for anyone running for President of the United States,' Texas Sen. Ted Cruz wrote Wednesday on Facebook . Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who hasn't formally entered the 2016 hunt, told Daily Mail Online that 'not only should they definitely give back the money and cease accepting foreign donations, but should also make every effort to find missing documents that would shed light if in fact they are innocent.' More problems: The Clinton Foundation erroneously reported it had received no funds from governments for three years \u2013 even though it previously received millions \u2013 and now has to refile its tax returns . Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly FIorina called the series of accusations against Bill and Hillary 'the Clinton way: raking in millions from foreign governments behind closed doors while making promises about transparency that they never intended to keep.' The Republican National Committee pounced as well. 'The new revelations reported by the New York Times continue to raise serious questions about Hillary Clinton's judgment and her handling of conflicts of interest surrounding the Clinton Foundation while serving as Secretary of State,' RNC spokeswoman Allison Moore said in a statement. Thursday's unrelenting news cycle about possible overlaps between the former first family's personal and charitable finances were prompted by details emerging about a new book titled 'Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich.' The book, due in stores next month, reportedly includes evidence that Hillary Clinton doled out special State Department favors to governments \u2013 and for-profit companies tied to them \u2013 in exchange for foundation donations and six-figure speaking fes for Bill Clinton. Hillary Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon laid out a lengthy defense on Thursday, writing online that a New York Times article outlining the charges included no 'direct evidence in support of the claim' that Mrs. Clinton did anything wrong. Former president Bill Clinton (left) received $500,000 for a Moscow speaking engagement with Renaissance Capital. He also met Vladimir Putin (right), at the time Russia's prime minister, during the visit . This week in New Hampshire, Hillary herself brushed off the brewing scandal. 'We're back into the political scene, and therefore we will be subjected to all kinds of distractions and I'm ready for it,' she told reporters in the town of Keene. 'I know that comes unfortunately with the territory.' 'It is, I think, worth noting that the Republicans seem to be talking only about me,' she added. 'They wouldn't have anything to talk about if I weren't in the race. But I am in the race, and hopefully we'll get onto the issues, and I look forward to that.' Mrs. Clinton herself has yet to outline any serious public policy positions in connection with her run for the White House.",

Nabil Fekir's goal and Alexandre Lacazette's penalty in the first half put Les Gones in control and Guingamp's hopes of a comeback took a blow when Christophe Kerbrat was given his marching orders before half-time. Clinton N'Jie struck just after the hour to put Hubert Fournier's side three goals to the good, meaning Claudio Beauvue's effort 10 minutes from time was only a consolation. Alexandre Lacazette celebrates after scoring a penalty for Lyon to send them top of Ligue 1 on Saturday . It was Lyon's first win in three and moved them back above Paris St Germain, who play third-placed Marseille in a much-anticipated encounter on Sunday evening. Two quick-fire second-half penalties saw Montpellier come from behind to beat Bastia 3-1 and move six points off the European places. Lucas Barrios and Anthony Mounier both struck from the spot within two minutes to cancel out Giovanni Sio's opener - with Morgan Sanson adding a third for the hosts in stoppage time. It was Lyon's first win in three and moved them back above Paris St Germain who play on Sunday . Lille got back to winning ways in emphatic fashion with a 3-1 triumph over strugglers Reims. Sebastien Corchia and Divock Origi put the hosts 2-0 up before Nicolas de Preville pulled one back for Reims but Nolan Roux added gloss to the scoreline at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy. At the other end of the table Rennes took a significant step closer to survival with a 3-0 win at Lorient, whose own hopes of avoiding the drop received another hit. Edson Mexer gave Rennes a 17th-minute lead and then goals either side of half-time from Sylvain Armand and Abdoulaye Doucoure ensured Philippe Montanier's men would be returning home with the points. Lille's French forward Nolan Roux is congratulated by teammates after scoring in their 3-1 win over Reims . Metz gave themselves at least some hope of staying up as Modibo Maiga's hat-trick earned them a 3-2 victory over relegation rivals Toulouse. Wissam Ben Yedder gave Toulouse a 21st-minute lead but Maiga - on loan from West Ham - quickly equalised, put Metz ahead before half-time and completed his treble early in the second period. Toulouse then had Marcel Tisserand sent off and could only manage a late consolation from Tongo Doumbia. Metz gave themselves at least some hope of staying up as Modibo Maiga's hat-trick earned them a 3-2 victory . Nice and Evian both picked up another point in their battles for survival following a 2-2 draw at the Allianz Riviera. Evian took a 18th-minute lead through Dany Nounkeu, Daniel Wass having wasted an earlier chance to put them in front from the penalty spot, but they had to rely on an Adrien Thomasson equaliser 12 minutes from time to earn a share of the spoils. Goals either side of half-time from Alexy Bosetti and Valentin Eysseric had turned the match in Nice's favour.

        "article": "His pristine white uniform was the epitome of buttoned-up respectability. But that was Prince Harry\u2019s only nod to formality yesterday as he began his month-long visit Down Under. Indeed, the playful royal larked around like a true larrikin. He laughed and joked with wellwishers. He offered handshakes and high fives. And he gurned like a good-un, making himself an instant hit with younger fans. Prince Harry was greeted by an enthusiastic crowd at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, all keen to catch a glimpse of the royal . The Prince pulled funny faces at a young girl waiting in the crowd with her mother, as others snapped photos on their smartphones . 'The people's Prince' continued to show off his playful side, high-fiving a young boy who was waiting behind a barricade . The Prince is in Australia to report for official military duty but he enjoyed his interaction with excited fans . Prince Harry has declared 'selfies are bad' during his visit to the Australian capital of Canberra as revellers scrambled to get a piece of the royal on their camera phones . The prince spent 20 minutes chatting and posing for photographs for crowds in Canberra, where he made a beeline for a youngster with a banner saying \u2018Redheads Rule\u2019. Ginger-haired Ethan Toscan, 12, who earned a high five from the royal after he spotted his home-made sign in the crowd, said: \u2018He said it was awesome to be a redhead. 'It was a pleasure meeting the prince and being able to shake his hand and give him a high five. I\u2019m over the moon.\u2019 While Harry was clearly eager to please, he didn\u2019t go as far as agreeing to a selfie with a teenage admirer. The prince, 30, smiled as he told the girl: \u2018No, I hate selfies ... I know you\u2019re young, but selfies are bad. Just take a normal photograph.\u2019 This seems to be a view shared by his grandmother, the Queen, who has said she finds it \u2018strange\u2019 to be greeted by a sea of smartphones at public engagements. Harry joked around with Ethan after spotting his sign and walking over to chat with the 12-year-old boy . Young Prince Harry fan Ethan poses with his 'Red Heads Rule' poster outside Canberra's War Memorial on Monday . Hundreds waited in the rain to see Harry, who was wearing a wristband in support of his charity project the Invictus Games \u2013 a sports event for injured service personnel \u2013 featuring the slogan: \u2018I am the master of my fate.\u2019 On arrival at the Australian War Memorial, he laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. It is likely to be his only public engagement during a four-week attachment to the Australian army, during which he is expected to train on helicopter simulators and join bush patrols in the North. Harry is in the last few weeks of his service before leaving the Army in June. He and Prince Charles will travel to Turkey later this month for the Anzac Day dawn service at Gallipoli, where Commonwealth forces including a joint Australian and New Zealand army suffered heavy casualties during the First World War. There was a potentially awkward moment as Dr Brendan Nelson, director of the Australian War Memorial, asked if Harry had seen the film \u2018Gallipoli\u2019. The 1981 movie, starring Mel Gibson, was criticised by some historians for depicting the British as ordering waves of Australian soldiers to their deaths. Harry said he had not seen the film and was told: \u2018It\u2019s worth watching.\u2019 One woman grabbed Harry's face and leaned in for a kiss on the cheek, with the Prince happily obliging .

        "article": "A writer and victim of date rape has revealed why she is pushing for 'yes means yes' sex contracts to become mandatory on college campuses across the country. New Yorker Amanda Chatel explained in her essay for Your Tango that adoption of the 'yes means yes' law, which defines consent as 'affirmative, conscious, and voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity' from each partner,\u00a0is just one step in combating society's prevalent rape culture. 'As a victim of date rape, when it comes to consent I strongly feel there is no grey area,' she wrote. 'Unfortunately, at the time, I was too young and naive to realize that because I never actually said, \u201cNo,\u201d I was a willing participant.' Inciting change: New Yorker Amanda Chatel explained in an essay that she is a victim of rape who is advocating for 'yes means yes' laws to be passed in states across the country . The 'yes means yes' law, which was first passed in California in 2014, is a spin on the old sexual assault mantra 'no means no'. The legislation declares that all colleges and universities taking financial aid funding from California must adhere to the standard for consent outlined by the law, which reiterates that a lack of resistance or objection does not imply consent - a concept that Amanda struggled with years following her sexual assault. Amanda explained for a long time she blamed herself because he 'came on strong' and she was a 'bit inebriated' 'But now, several years later, I know, more than ever, that my consent was not given, and it was rape. End of story,' she wrote. Amanda even noted that she was unable to attach the word 'rape' to what had happened to her and instead referred the assault as 'sex I didn\u2019t want'. At the time, she said that like many women, she didn't even consider going to the police after she was raped, a mistake that she noted she will 'never make again'. According to statistics, an estimated one out of five women will be sexually assaulted during their college careers. No shame: The New Yorker wrote that she blamed herself for years after her sexual assault because never actually said 'No', even though she wasn't a willing participant . 'It\u2019s both disheartening and disgusting that we even need a law that stipulates that a woman must be able to give consent or else it\u2019s rape,' Amanda said of today's rape culture. In Connecticut, state officials are now considering the adoption of a similar 'yes means yes' bill. And while Amanda said the law is 'great in theory', she explained that 'we need to change the way people think of rape' before the law will prove to be effective. 'I believe more than anything is that we need to teach boys and men NOT to rape,' she said. 'We need to make them see that women and girls are not their personal playthings, that we were not put on this earth for their pleasure, and if we drink too much at a party, that we sure as hell aren't \"asking for it\",' she added. And at least two California lawmakers agree with her. Last month, Senate President Kevin de Leon and Assemblywoman Hannah-Beth Jackson announced that they were introducing legislation that would call for school districts with mandatory health education requirements for graduation to include sexual violence prevention as a mandatory part of the curriculum, including instruction on the recently approved 'yes means yes' law. 'If we want to prevent sexual assault, it\u2019s important that we start early,' Ms Jackson explained in March. She continued: 'This bill will ensure that discussions about healthy relationships and consent are taking place in high school, with young women and young men, so we can help establish boundaries of acceptable behavior.'",

Officials in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland were unhappy to find out about the FA ditching a tournament that started in 1925 via a letter from chairman Greg Dyke, with no warning or consultation. This is seen as another example of FA \u2018arrogance\u2019 following the English telling FIFA that they want to send Great Britain football teams to the Rio Olympics without informing the other countries, who put the kybosh on the initiative. England's Riess Nelson (right) puts pressure on Scotland's Jack Adamson during the 2014 Victory Shield . England's withdrawal from the event, as told by FA chairman Greg Dyke (left), left the home nations fuming . And England\u2019s desire to have more varied opposition for their Under 16 players is not going down well in Wales, the current holders of the Victory Shield. The FA say they have kept the tournament organisers in the loop and only revised their plans after Sky Sports cut their title sponsorship - which the TV station dispute - and wanted changes to the format. The remaining Victory Shield competitors are planning to invite another country from Europe to replace England. Meanwhile, there was some surprise that Dyke chose to go to the Premier League Under 21 cup final between Southampton and Blackburn last Monday rather than the FA Youth Cup final first leg between Manchester City and Chelsea at the Etihad academy. The FA say Dyke had business on the south coast.

In another scene, a man smiles blissfully as he hugs his emotional father. These pictures show the moving moments men, women and children living in the United States were reunited with their deported relatives after the border gate to Mexico was temporarily opened on Sunday. The steel gate at Border Field State Park in California, which was put in place in the mid-1990s, was unlocked by officials in honor of Children's Day, a Mexican holiday that celebrates youngsters and family. And for selected families, it was a long-awaited, intense experience. Two young boys reportedly fell to their knees as they crossed into Mexico and saw their cherished mother for the first time in two years. Emotional: With tears in her eyes, Yolanda Verona, from Tijuana, Mexico, bends down and embraces her seven-year-old granddaughter, Frida Villagomez - whom she has not seen in years - after the gate\u00a0at Border Field State Park in California was briefly opened for Children's Day . Reunited: Robert Vivar (pictured in the light-colored top) watches as his daughter, Lelainah, seven, hugs his father Robert Vivar Sr at the gate . Joyful: Mr Vivar smiles blissfully as he embraced by his emotional father on the other side of the California fence, while his daughters Lelainah and four-year-old Willow watch. A Border Patrol Officer (left) also smiles as the family reunites during the event, organized by Border Angels . Tear-jerking: Lourdes Barraza Torres and her toddler daughter, Reyna, are seen hugging Torres's two sons, including Alexis Lopez, 10, as they are reunited for the first time in two years. Alex said he 'felt nervous, but at the same time, excited' at the prospect of seeing his mother again . However, the pair, whose mother had been deported to the country while they were at school, only had two minutes to spend with her - because then it was time for another family to be reunited. One of the boys, Alexis Lopez, now 10, told U-T San Diego that he 'felt nervous, but at the same time, excited' to briefly meet his mother, Lourdes Barraza, in front of other families and photographers. He added: 'We talked about how life was without our mom. About how much we love each other.' Event organizer Father Dermot Rodgers said that while the brief reunions were held for Children's Day, they were also meant to draw attention to what he called a broken immigration system. Many of the families were separated when relatives were deported to Mexico after living in the U.S. without documentation. The gate had only been opened to those affected once before, in 2013. No touching: The gate at Border Field State Park, which was put in place in the mid-1990s, was unlocked by officials for Children's Day, a Mexican holiday that celebrates youngsters and family.

The pair had driven from Washington for the opportunity to meet with deported Ms Florencia . Beaming: Ms Florencia speaks with her relatives through the border fence, which has only been opened to relatives once before - in 2013 . Special event: Many of the families were separated when relatives were deported to Mexico after living in the U.S. without documentation . Aside from then and on Sunday, separated loved ones had only been able to speak to each other through the U.S./Mexico border fence, which has thick, steel mesh and is patrolled by officials. The mesh makes seeing each other nearly impossible - never mind touching. On Sunday, four families - some from as far away as Florida - were given the chance to hug, kiss and share tears of joy. Border Angels organized the event. Founded by\u00a0Enrique Morones in 1986, the non-profit organization provided toys for children who were reunited with their relatives at the fence. 'It\u2019s only a couple of minutes, but that\u2019s a whole world to somebody who had only been able to see (their family) through Skype, or the wall,' Mr Morones told the news site on Monday. Couple: Hugo Alvarado, of San Diego, California, chats to his wife Guadalupe through the border fence, which is heavily patrolled by officials . Gazing out: Ms Florencia speaks with family members through the border fence. It is not known when the border gate will next be opened . In chage: Enrique Morones (left), the founder of the Border Angels, which organized the event, stands with Border Patrol Officers as he speaks with people who are about to approach the border fence near the ocean. 'It\u2019s only a couple of minutes, but that\u2019s a whole world to somebody who had only been able to see (their family) through Skype, or the wall,' Mr Morones said on Monday as the gate was opened to families . Tight security: Border Patrol Officers are pictured standing by the gate in the border fence, just minutes before four families were reunited . 'To finally put your arms around somebody and realize that love has no borders is very significant.' The pictures from Sunday's event include an image of two-year-old Abel speaking to his mother, Yolanda Verona through the border fence, while being held by his uncle, Albert Villagomez.

The new study highlights the areas in Washington, Oregon and California that would require more time to successfully evacuate for higher ground in the case of the next natural disaster. It calculated that 94,872 residents and 42,424 employees live within the tsunami hazard zones of the three states. Also in danger are 486 public venues, 440 dependent care facilities and 2,314 businesses with a 'significant customer presence'. Scroll down for video . A tsunami evacuation route sign  in Nehalem, Oregon, just one of the Pacific Northwest communities\u00a0in the path of a potentially deadly tsunami that could be similar to the one in 2011 that ravaged parts of Japan . Seventy-seven percent of the communities lying in the risk zone are equipped with the kind of geography and location to allow them the 15 to 25 minutes required for successful tsunami evacuation after a large-magnitude earthquake hits. And some communities can increase their chance of survival simply by walking faster. According to the analysis, 21,562 residents, more than 50 percent of which live in Washington, would not have time to evade the tsunami's waves if they were walking on foot at 2.2 mph. But if they adjusted their pace to 3.5 mph, the number of people at risk drops below 16,000. And 90 per cent of the 20,000 people who live in the two communities most at-risk, Aberdeen and Hoquiam in Washington,  could reach safety by just walking at a normal pace. 'Just by getting people to move faster, you can save thousands of lives,' Nathan Woods, US Geological Survey geographer and lead author of the study, told\u00a0the\u00a0Seattle Times. Wood said these communities would most benefit by making sure residents have studied the best tsunami evacuation routes. But there are the coastal towns who wouldn't have the time to evacuate on foot, no matter how fast they walk or run, according to the analysis, conducted by the US Geological Survey, the University of Colorado, Boulder and California State University, Sacramento. This graph ranks the chances of the 73 communities considered to be in the tsunami danger zone for a successful evacuation. The third class is considered 'unlikely to have successful evacuations' Washington communities Ocean Shores, Grays Harbor County, Pacific County and Long Beach, as well as Oregon town Seaside, are listed as 'unlikely to have successful evacuations'. According to Wood, these specific communities need to instead work toward designing and constructing tsunami evacuation structures so that reaching higher ground isn't necessary. But the study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, warns that successful evacuations are not guaranteed for any community - no matter where its located. 'Individuals still need to understand the threat, recognize signs of imminent waves and take self-protective action,' it concludes. Wood told CBS News that any community on the coast of the Pacific Northwest was 'vulnerable to varying degrees' to a tsunami. 'Having a better sense of how a community is specifically vulnerable provides officials with the ability to develop outreach, preparedness, and evacuation plans that are tailored to local conditions and needs.'",

History postgraduate Laura Sumner, 24, was given ten days to leave the country after being fined \u00a323.50 for an alleged visa violation. But Russian media reports have branded her \u2018Agent Sumner\u2019 and linked her to a bizarre claim of a revolutionary plot. Laura Mary Sumner, pictured, has been ordered to leave Russia within ten days after being branded a 'spy' A pro-Kremlin website claimed she was one of a number of students carrying out research in Russia by British historian, Professor Sarah Badcock. The report claimed the Nottingham University academic\u2019s work was \u2018important for the plans of the West to create a \u201ccolour revolution\u201d in Russia\u2019. The term describes the overthrow of governments in former Soviet states, such as the 2004 Orange Revolution in Ukraine. Professor Badcock, 40, is supervising Miss Sumner\u2019s PhD thesis on early Soviet Russia but there has been no suggestion outside Russian media that either woman is involved in espionage or plans to foment revolution. Russian authorities accused her of conducting research in the country without the appropriate visa . Ms Sumner, left, was researching Soviet rule from 1917 to 1921 as part of her PhD under Professor Sarah Badcock of Nottingham University, right, who is acknowledged as one of Britain's leading Russian experts . Questions have been raised over whether Miss Sumner has fallen victim to a tit-for-tat punishment by Russia. It came on the day that it emerged Britain had granted political asylum to a wealthy supporter of a prominent Russian opposition leader called Vladimir Ashurkov, who has been accused of embezzlement. And diplomatic relations have remained tense following Britain\u2019s decision to launch a public inquiry into the poisoning of Kremlin critic Alexander Litvinenko in London. Action was taken against Miss Sumner by the Federal Migration Service but sources claimed officers from the FSB, the successor to the feared KGB, were in the courtroom. Federal Judge Ilya Varlamov, pictured, ordered that Ms Sumner must leave the country within 10 days . Ms Sumner, left, appeared in court along with an interpreter, right, and was ordered to pay a \u00a323.50 fine . A migration service spokesman said the hearing on Wednesday April 1 in the city of Nizhny Novgorod was \u2018not an April Fool joke\u2019. Nottingham University said Miss Sumner appeared to have fallen foul of a \u2018minor infringement in visa regulations\u2019 but did not respond to the spying claims. She has been offered consular support by the British Embassy. Miss Sumner, from Solihull, describes herself as a feminist and dog lover on Twitter, and has been working on her thesis for more than a year. She has been to Moscow and Nizhny Novgorod at least twice to carry out research. She was unavailable for comment and her Twitter account had been deleted yesterday. Professor Badcock was also unavailable and was said to be on holiday with her family.",

A Polish father has wandered into the London Embassy with no memory of who he is except that he has a daughter. The mystery man, who may be suffering from amnesia, does not know how he came to lose his memory or be in the UK, and cannot even recall his own name. All that he could remember was that he was from the Poznan area of Poland and has a daughter called Lenka. He may or may not have come from Denmark within the past few days. The man, who was found without identification, taken to hospital after he arrived at the Polish Consulate in central London yesterday afternoon. Currently, the only clue to his identity is a distinctive tattoo of a flower on his right upper arm. He is being cared for at London's St Thomas' Hospital while police appeal for anyone who recognises him to come forward. Scotland Yard said: 'Police are appealing for help to identify a Polish man who has been taken to St Thomas' Hospital suffering memory loss. 'The man attended the Polish Consulate at around 5pm on Thursday, 2 April. 'Due to his lack of memory, he was taken by London Ambulance Service to the hospital as a precaution. 'The man is able to state that he was born in Poland and may have travelled to London from Denmark within the past few days.

'He is a white man, 5ft 8ins in height of medium build. He has a tattoo of a flower on his right upper arm.' Anyone with information should call Lambeth Missing Person Unit on 101. What is retrograde amnesia? Amnesia is the name given to a disturbance in the ability to recall stored memories. It is usually caused by disease or head injury, but in rare cases can occur apparently spontaneously. The memory loss associated with amnesia can include everything from a person's past or just portions of it. In most cases, it is a temporary condition, lasting from a few seconds to a few hours. But in severe cases, it can last months or even years. There are several different types of amnesia. Retrograde amnesia is an inability to remember any events that occurred before the accident or illness.

        "article": "Sorry: Journalist Sabrina Rubin Erdely (pictured) is expected to apologize for an article she wrote for Rolling Stone magazine about campus rape . The journalist who wrote Rolling Stone's flawed account of a campus rape is set to apologize Sunday night, when the Columbia Journalism School publishes a review of what went wrong with her reporting. Sabrina Rubin Erdely has been silent since December, when the magazine was forced to issue an apology in the wake of several factual errors highlighted in the piece about a University of Virginia student named Jackie. In the story, titled 'A Rape on Campus', Jackie claims to have been gang raped by seven men at campus fraternity Phi Kappa Psi two years ago. But a recent investigation by the Charlottesville Police found no evidence to support her story- including the fact that the man who brought her to the fraternity the night of the alleged incident doesn't seem to exist. The Columbia Graduate School of Journalism will release their review of the botched Rolling Stone investigation at 8pm on Sunday. Following that, sources tell CNN\u00a0that Erdely will release an apologetic statement and Rolling Stone will take the story down from their website. While the article initially sparked protests on campus, Erdely's reporting quickly began to fall apart as the Washington Post and  local outlets started following up on the allegations. One mistake of Erdely's previously highlighted, was the fact she agreed not to contact Jackie's alleged attackers. Scroll down for video . Report: The Columbia Journalism School is expected to release a review of the botched story Sunday night . Claims: The story published in November focused on a University of Virginia student named \u00a0Jackie who claimed to have been gang raped by seven men at the campus' Phi Kappa Psi fraternity two years ago. Above, the frat house on January 15, 2015 . Anonymous: Jackie has never been identified. Police officials say she refused to be interviewed in the course of their investigation . Three of Jackie's friends also denied Erdely's assertion that they discouraged the alleged victim from reporting the assault. By December 5, Rolling Stone acknowledged that there appeared 'to be discrepancies in Jackie's account.' The magazine asked for the independent review, which was conducted by the dean of the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism. The fraternity has called the article defamatory and said it was exploring its legal options. 'These false accusations have been extremely damaging to our entire organization, but we can only begin to imagine the setback this must have dealt to survivors of sexual assault,' said Stephen Scipione, president of the Virginia Alpha Chapter of Phi Kappa Psi, after the Charlottesville police suspended their investigation. Despite its flaws, the article heightened scrutiny of campus sexual assaults amid a campaign by President Barack Obama. The University of Virginia had already been on the Department of Education's list of 55 colleges under investigation for their handling of sex assault violations. The article also prompted UVA President Teresa Sullivan to temporarily suspend Greek social events. Fraternities later agreed to ban kegs, hire security workers and keep at least three fraternity members sober at each event.",

Rodgers failed to make it as a professional footballer despite leaving Northern Ireland for England at the age of 16 and training with the Reading youth team. The Reds manager believes the memory of missing out on a first team spot despite being promised one has helped him to handle Liverpool's young players. Brendan Rodgers takes positives from his experience of not making it as a professional footballer . 20-year-old star Raheem Sterling (left) has flourished under the guidance of Rodgers . Speaking of his experience, Rodgers told Barclays: 'I felt as a young player I didn't get the chance. I was a talented youth player in Northern Ireland. 'I came to England, to Reading when I was 16. I was captain of the youth team and was then in the first team squad. 'The manager at the time asked me to play in the reserve game on the Monday to get some game time then look to make my first team debut on the Wednesday against Fulham.

Rodgers failed to make it as a professional footballer despite leaving Northern Ireland for England aged 16 . 'When Wednesday came, I was expected to play and it ended up that I didn't play. That hit me probably harder than it should have done. 'I felt that from that moment that I was probably never going to get the chance.' The 42-year-old believes those experiences as a youngster have helped him to nurture the talents of the likes of Sterling, who has already made 120 appearances for Liverpool at the tender age of 20. Rodgers (centre) described himself as a 'talented youth player', but he failed to make the grade . Rodgers (middle row, second up) was on the books at Reading where he was captain of the youth team . Sterling made his Liverpool debut in August, 2012 as Liverpool were beaten 2-1 by Norwich City . Rodgers added: 'But those negative experiences, I was able to turn them into a positive in my life and in my work. 'I could help young players and prepare them. If I told young players they were going to play, they would play. 'There comes a time when you have to let them go. Sometimes you never know until they're in the arena. They just want that opportunity.' Jordan Ibe looks to have a bright future at Liverpool as Rodgers looks to give youth a chance .",

The 18-year-old was hit over the head 20 times with a rock and dragged into a garden where she was raped by the man and left for dead in the Beeston area of Leeds last month. The unidentified victim will speak out in tonight's episode of Crimewatch in which she tells reporters she is too scared to sleep for fear of reliving the ordeal in her dreams.

In the programme, she describes how she was waiting for the bus home in the Beeston area of Leeds last month. She was grabbed by the man, who is still at large, and pushed into the garden. There she was bludgeoned several times over the head with a large stone before being raped and left for dead . In the programme, she describes waiting for the bus home when\u00a0she\u00a0was grabbed by the man, who is still at large, and pushed into the garden. There she was bludgeoned several times over the head with a large stone\u00a0before\u00a0being raped and left for dead. The victim told Crimewatch: 'Then it was getting dark. I went to the bus\u00a0stop. I was waiting for a bus to go home. 'I haven't been able to stop thinking about what happened. I've stopped sleeping because I can see what happened when I am trying to\u00a0sleep.' He is described as being of Pakistani or Middle Eastern origin, in his early twenties and slim with a receding hairline. West Yorkshire Police are treating the crime as a rape and attempted\u00a0murder,\u00a0and are scouring the area for clues as to his whereabouts. This is the blood-stained rock used by a rapist to hit his 18-year-old victim over the head 20 times before sexually assaulting her in a harrowing attack . A map showing the areas of Leeds, where the rapist had been stalking women on the night of the attack . CCTV from earlier the same evening on March 6 shows a man of the\u00a0same description stalking three other women elsewhere in the city.

The morphed image uses the previous e-fit and the description given by one\u00a0of\u00a0the women he was caught following. Detective Superintendent Nick Wallen said: 'We believe this new image is\u00a0the\u00a0most realistic likeness we have yet had of the man we are still working\u00a0very\u00a0hard to identify. 'It has been created from the victim's description of him and from the\u00a0recollection of one of the women he stalked in the period leading up to the\u00a0attack. 'I would ask people to study it very closely alongside the other elements\u00a0of\u00a0description that we have already released and think hard about whether they\u00a0know who it is.' In a graphic CCTV sequence the man is seen dragging the woman from the bus stop and into a garden to rape her . This chilling footage was released by West Yorkshire Police in a bid to trace the man who is wanted for rape and attempted murder .

Det Supt Wallen added: 'This was an appalling attack on a young woman where\u00a0a\u00a0shocking level of violence was used which could so easily have had fatal\u00a0consequences. 'It has understandably had a very significant traumatic effect on the\u00a0victim\u00a0and that clearly comes across in the emotive comments she has made which feature in tonight's Crimewatch programme. 'We are very grateful to the local and national media for all the support\u00a0they\u00a0have given our ongoing appeals over the last seven weeks.

Late in the summer of 2012, just a couple of months into the reign of Brendan Rodgers, he was lined up as makeweight in a failed bid to sign Fulham's Clint Dempsey only for the midfielder to reject the move. His determination to prove himself, and justify the \u00a316million price tag which came with him from Sunderland the previous summer, has been rewarded not only with a new five-year \u00a3100,000-a-week contract but with the prospect of him taking over the captain's armband from Steven Gerrard when he leaves for the Los Angeles Galaxy at the end of the season. Jordan Henderson is 'over the moon' after signing a new long-term contract with Liverpool . The club's vice-captain puts pen to paper on a deal which will keep him at Liverpool until 2020 . Henderson has enjoyed a strong campaign and could be handed the armband when Steven Gerrard leaves . But it is the unfulfilled potential which persuaded the 24-year-old England international to commit what should be the best years of his career to the club. 'A few years ago I had an opportunity to leave but I always knew how big this club is and I wanted to stay here for as long as possible - and nothing has changed since then,' he told liverpoolfc.com. 'I feel as though I have got a good connection with the club now and there was no doubt where my future was going to be and it was just a matter of time for my agent and the club to sort it out. 'I have been through difficult times but I would never change that because I know there will be more difficult times ahead and I'll have to use that and I'll be able to handle it a lot better. 'Hopefully we've got many years ahead of winning trophies. 'I'm the same as every other player, I want to be playing at the highest level - in the Champions League, winning trophies and being very successful. 'I had good conversations with the manager about the future of the football club and it was very bright, I was very pleased with what I was hearing. 'I want to be a big part of that and hopefully I can. 'I feel there's a lot of potential, but we need to start turning that potential into winning things. I've got a good feeling that we can do that.' Henderson\u00a0arrived from Sunderland in a \u00a316million deal in June 2011, when Kenny Dalglish was manager . The Liverpool midfielder shoots towards goal during Liverpool's FA Cup semi-final defeat by Aston Villa . Rodgers hopes other players - youngsters Raheem Sterling (who has rejected a \u00a3100,000-a-week offer), Jordon Ibe and experienced defender Martin Skrtel are all currently negotiating new deals - will follow Henderson's lead. 'We are obviously delighted. It is great news for the club and Jordan that he will be spending best part of his career and development here at Liverpool and he is a big part of the plan going forward,' said the Reds boss. 'I am delighted for him and the club and we can continue his development. 'The club paid big money for him at the time because he had big potential and that potential has been developed and he will go into the next phase of that. 'The likes of Jordan and Raheem are very important players and the club, behind the scenes, is working very hard to ensure we sign these type of players. 'The model is to develop young players and when they have improved it is important you nail them to the club and make sure they are here for the best part of their careers.'

A set of wheels broke off the Boeing 737 moments after it touched down at the airport, near Derby, causing the cargo plane to skid along the runway for 380ft before coming to a stop. It happened as the plane delivered 10 tonnes of freight, including dangerous goods, on an Air Contractors flight that originated in Athens and included a stopover at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris. The cargo planes left main landing gear detached due to heat damage to chrome plating, a report said . The plane\u2019s 38-year-old captain and co-pilot escaped injury, and there were no passengers on board when the left main landing gear detached. The plane, manufactured in 1990, suffered significant damage to its left wing and engine as it slid along the runway in darkness on the morning of April 29, 2014, according to an Air Accidents Investigation Branch report. As the plane landed its speed was reduced and the co-pilot handed control to the captain, who pressed on the brakes twice to disengage the autobrake system. The touchdown was \u2018unremarkable\u2019 and the autobrake functioned normally, according to the report, but the left main landing gear came off when an inner cylinder, just above the axle, fractured as a result of heat damage to chrome plating. The report stated: \u2018The aircraft shuddered and rolled slightly left-wing-low as the lower part of the main landing gear detached.\u2019 It said that the source of the heat could not be determined. The report cited concerns about communications between air traffic control and other agencies . As the plane came to a stop its flight crew feared that it would burst into flames, with the co-pilot and the pilot of a different plane reporting smoke to air traffic control. The report stated: \u2018The co-pilot saw some smoke drift past the aircraft as it came to a halt. The commander \u2026 had reached the conclusion that one of the main landing gear legs had failed, but as a result of the other pilot\u2019s transmission, he was also concerned that the aircraft might be on fire.\u2019 The captain shut down the engines and switched off the battery as firefighters attended the scene, but the plane did not catch fire. Firefighters placed a ladder against the door to allow the captain and co-pilot to disembark, and they sprayed foam around the landing gear and engine as a precaution. The report cited concerns about communications between air traffic control and other agencies, and said the airport operator issued a safety bulletin with a reminder of emergency protocols and procedures. The landing gear overhaul company carried out a review as a precaution, as it was not clear how or when the chrome plating damage occurred.",

In addition to telling Michelle Obama that public school children can't live on one packet of ketchup alone, Peter criticizes the First Lady for America's lack of troops in the Middle East and in the Ukraine.

Dear Michelle Obama, . My name is Peter. I am eight years old. I love studying history of the U.S.A. I have enjoyed learning about the great choices the USA has made\u2026 . And then their was your husbands election. I think you should rethink your idea that takes us to one ketchup packet per meal. I feel it is taking away from our patriotism toward America. I also think you should stop doing nothing and go send some troops to the Middle East. I also think your husband needs to work on his speeches. He also disappointed millions of Americans by not bombing Syria. If you do not know thousands of peoples homes are destroyed by ISIS in the Middle East. You should also get the UN to send troops to Ukraine. Also may I ask you, is the White House comfortable? Thank you for your time and consideration . Signed, . A concerned 8 year old citizen, .

I think you should rethink your idea that takes us to one ketchup packet per meal. I feel that it is taking away our patriotism toward America,' he writes.

Peter's father told The Weekly Standard that he found the letter on his son's desk and that it took his boy months to angrily write it. Peter's mother said that her son does not need to worry about having just one ketchup packet at lunch because he goes to a private school. That's when Peter apparently precociously told his parents he wanted to 'give a voice to the voiceless,' reports The Weekly Standard. The end of Peter's letter alluded to the First Family's cushy accommodations. 'Is the White House comfortable?' concludes the letter from 'a concerned citizen.'

        "article": "Conor O\u2019Shea has revealed his concern at the increasing force of rugby\u2019s collisions after Harlequins and England full back Mike Brown was consigned to even more time on the sidelines to recover from the latest high-profile head injury. Brown has not played since the final round of the RBS 6 Nations on March 21, is still suffering headaches after a week-long holiday in Dubai and no closer to being declared symptom-free. The episode raises questions about whether the 29-year-old was brought back too early for England\u2019s title-decider against France, having been knocked out in the Test against Italy five weeks earlier following a crunching collision with Andrea Masi. Mike Brown is knocked out in a collision with Italy\u2019s Andrea Masi in the Six Nations last month . Brown was out cold for approximately eight minutes and hasn't played since the Italy game on March 21st . \u2018It\u2019s a concern because I don\u2019t like someone coming in with something you can\u2019t diagnose,\u2019 said O\u2019Shea, Quins\u2019 director of rugby. \u2018Sometimes a physio will sit you down and say, \u201cIt\u2019s six to 12 weeks out\u201d. Here it could be tomorrow or it could be whenever \u2014 we don\u2019t have a timescale. There\u2019s no doubt that a decade or even a year ago Browny would be back out on the pitch. \u2018You want to see the gladiatorial side of things \u2014 the big hits that we\u2019ve all grown up with. It was once a badge of honour that you got up and got on with it. But at least we\u2019re now aware. Is it a concern for the game that we\u2019re seeing collisions of the nature that we are? Yes, it has to be.\u2019 Brown will have played just six of his club\u2019s last 19 games after sitting out of the coming weekend, and his England team-mates Joe Marler and Chris Robshaw have featured in only eight of the last 18. Northampton have ruled out George North, who is suffering from his own concussion problems after being knocked out in three different collisions, until the end of the month and O\u2019Shea must also deal with the absence of one of his marquee players. George North suffered his third concussion in four months during Northampton's defeat to Wasps . \u2018You can look at a succession of events for George North, whereas this is a follow-on of symptoms from one event,\u2019 said O\u2019Shea. \u2018Against Italy it was as big a hit as I\u2019ve seen someone take. It was quite frankly a monstrous hit. I was pretty worried when I saw it live. \u2018Is it tough on us having the England full back for six out of 19 games and still indeterminate? Yes, but there are more important things than rugby.\u2019",

        "article": "It's official: alcohol makes you more attractive to the opposite sex.\u00a0And that's when you are boozing, not them. Scientists at the University of Bristol found that having 'one large glass of wine' increases 'facial flushing' and 'confidence', making the drinker 'more attractive' to others and more likely to 'get lucky'. Researchers quizzed 40 heterosexual male and female students and asked them to rate the attractiveness of three groups of people who were sober, tipsy and drunk. A study of 40 men and women found drinking a glass of wine makes you more attractive to the opposite sex... ...but too much booze leads to 'excessive and unattractive' changes in facial expressions, like Bridget Jones . The study found that tipsy people, who had downed one large 250ml glass of 14 per cent wine - that's one-third of the bottle - were consistently voted as the 'most attractive'. Sober subjects and those who had 'had a few too many' were rated as far less attractive than a 'tipsy' subject. Academics have previously confirmed the existence of the 'beer goggles' phenomenon - in which boozers find other people more attractive after several drinks. This new study, however, is the first time it had been shown that the drinker themselves actually 'becomes more attractive' to others, in an experiment dubbed 'reverse beer goggles'. The study found that alcohol had a 'positive pulling power', but only if the subject was 'not hammered'. It states that booze 'mimics' how a person's body 'demonstrates it is healthy and attractive to attract potential mates' and that facial flushing is perceived by others as 'healthy and attractive'. Alcohol also makes people seem in a 'more positive or jolly mood' and encourages people to 'relax' and give off 'positive' signals, such as smiling - increasing their attractiveness levels. The study states: 'In addition to perceiving others as more attractive, an alcohol consumer may also be perceived by others as more attractive, and therefore receive greater sexual interest from potential mates. 'An increase in such attention from others may also positively reinforce alcohol consumption, particularly in social contexts.' The study found alcohol has 'positive pulling power' but only if the person isn't too intoxicated . The study said, however, that too much booze led to 'changes in facial expressions which were excessive and unattractive' - leading to a decrease in 'pulling power'. It adds: 'In conclusion, our data indicate that alcohol consumption may lead to consumers being rated as more attractive than sober individuals, but only following low levels of consumption. 'At higher levels of consumption this effect is not observed, and may even be reversed.' Professor Marcus Munafo, a senior researcher on the Bristol University study, said: 'The people who had consumed a small amount of alcohol had a slightly rosier complexion than they did in their sober and high-dose photos. 'Rosiness is attractive because it characterises good physical health characteristics. 'You consume a drink, so you see other people as more attractive, but you also become more attractive yourself because you've consumed a drink. 'But if they go on to consume more alcohol, they're no longer rated as more attractive.' In a previous study last year, again at the University of Bristol, it was found that 'beer goggles' - in which booze makes others seems more attractive - was a proven phenomena. Volunteers drank either alcohol or a non-alcoholic placebo before looking at images of men's and women's faces - as well a landscape portraits. Those who drank alcohol found all three image types more attractive compared with those who did not. David Simmons, 31, of High Wycombe, Bucks, said last week: 'So if I want to pull I need to drink either a third of a bottle of wine or a couple of pints and then draw a line under boozing for the night. 'I can't really see that happened as after a couple you always want more, but if it improves my chances of pulling I'll give it a shot.'",

With no cell phone reception to call for help, owner Tom George had to leave his dog Shelby stuck in a pool by  the Great Salt Lake's Spiral Jetty and drive an hour out to the nearest \u00a0town. But, lucky for George, a family was willing to stay with Shelby - and only more and more strangers followed as they heard his story. Scroll down for video . Twenty strangers joined forces to help rescue a dog named Shelby out of a tar pit he had gotten stuck in near the shoreline of the Great Salt Lake . As more people came, they began bringing  items to try and help get Shelby out, using grocery bags, car floor mats, tarp, garbage bags, a straw hat and even bare hands . 'The whole time I was driving I kind of figured there was already a really good chance he was already gone,' George told Fox 13 Salt Lake City. And at first the situation looked 'pretty hopeless', according to Max McGregor, whose family stayed with the dog. 'I was pretty sure that the back legs, the way they were positioned, they were going to snap right where the knee was,' said McGregor's daughter Chloe. Todd Tanner, a Fox 13 reporter who was supposed to shoot video of the Spiral Jetty that day, said only Shelby's head was visible from the pit. He thought the dog was dying. But then a family who was visiting the shoreline with a photography group came over to help. And a huge group of friends from Salt Lake City jumped in as well. As more people came, they began bringing  items to try and help get Shelby out, using grocery bags, car floor mats, tarp, garbage bags, a straw hat and even bare hands. With no cell phone reception to call for help, owner Tom George had to leave his dog Shelby stuck by the Great Salt Lake's Spiral Jetty and drive an hour out to the nearest town . But the group was able to separate the dog from the tar, piece by piece, as they continued to put objects in to pit to keep Shelby from getting stuck again or from continuing to sink lower into the pool of tar . Shelby still couldn't move after he was freed from the pits, so five people helped carry him to the road and saw that George had come back just in time . Max McGregor said that as they separated the dog from the tar piece by piece, they would continue putting objects in the pit to keep Shelby from getting stuck again or continuing to sink. According to Tanner, no one in the newly-formed group 'knew exactly what to do', but they worked for over an hour together to find a way to get Shelby out. 'Total strangers talked, and worked, shoulder to shoulder, and figured it out,' he wrote in an exclusive for Fox 13 Salt Lake City. 'They didn't know each other\u2019s names, and they didn't care. They ruined their clothes, they interrupted their plans, and they made a memory to last a lifetime. And yes, they saved Shelby.' Shelby still couldn't move after he was freed from the pit, so five people helped carry him to the road and saw that George had come back just in time. Veterinarians had to work on Shelby for 6 to 8 hours that night and had to shave most of his hair off to remove more than 40lb of tar . George said that Shelby's brother Rue stuck to his side, even sleeping next to him that first night after the accident.Shelby (right) has since recovered and his once 'splendid coat' is growing back as well .

'You know what the best part is, though? Everybody that heard came and brought something and tried to help, and everybody had ideas,' said Cathy McGregor.

        "article": "Unwilling: The British Medical Association also found nearly two-thirds of GPs were not willing to join into larger groups to ensure one surgery in an area was open on Saturdays and Sundays . GPs are in revolt over Government plans for them to offer patients appointments seven days a week. Almost all family doctors polled in a new survey said they do not think their own practice should open on weekends. And nearly two-thirds are not even willing to consider forming groups with other surgeries to ensure that at least one in the area is open to patients on Saturdays and Sundays. The Government has tried to encourage GPs to offer out-of-hours appointments through a scheme known as the Prime Minister\u2019s Challenge Fund, launched in 2013. Surgeries have been urged to form into groups of 20 to 30 to ensure that between them at least one stays open in the evenings and at weekends. The results of early trials published last month showed that among 34 practices taking part in the scheme in Central London, the number of patients going to A&E dropped by between 8 and 10 per cent. But a survey of 15,560 GPs by their union, the British Medical Association, found 63 per cent were opposed to forming networks with other surgeries to open seven days a week. Some 94 per cent were against their own practice opening every day. Just 2 per cent were in favour, while the remainder didn\u2019t know. The survey also found that 67 per cent want to make the standard ten minute appointment longer to give them more time to properly care for patients. And 93 per cent said their heavy workload has negatively affected patient care. This is mainly because they do not have the staff or the resources to provide appointments to the increasing numbers seeking them. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chairman of the BMA\u2019s GP Committee, said: \u2018GPs want to provide better services and spend more time with their patients, especially the increasing number of older people who often have a range of multiple health needs that require intensive, coordinated care. 'Unfortunately, this landmark poll highlights that GPs\u2019 ability to care for patients is being seriously undermined by escalating workload, inadequate resourcing and unnecessary paperwork. Drop: A trial period opening GPs surgeries seven days a week found the numbers going to A&E fell . \u2018While there is a willingness from GPs to look at offering extended hours, more than nine in ten GPs do not feel that their practice can provide blanket seven day services when GPs are struggling to provide even basic care to their patients. \u2018GPs also feel it is more important to provide longer consultations.\u2019",

Brennan, 25, from Liverpool, vanished in the resort of Javea in January last year after being kidnapped by men posing as police. His body was wrapped in an industrial-size bin bag with duct tape round it when it appeared on a beach in nearby Orihuela Costa. Civil Guard officers in Alicante confirmed today they believe Monk, from Essex, may be implicated in the violent death and named him as an associate of Paul Scott. Scott, 32, was arrested on a charge of conspiracy to import cocaine after being caught trying to sneak into Britain in a light aircraft last December. He was also wanted for questioning over Mr Brennan's murder when he was detained. Guardia Civil described him last night as the suspected mastermind of the crime. Monk was detained at a four-bedroom property in Javea near Alicante as he directed workers laying a marble patio around his swimming pool. An imitation firearm with a silencer and nearly \u00a3100,000 in cash were also found. He is being held in jail and is expected to be charged and face trial in Spain over Mr Brennan's murder before being extradited to the UK to face questioning over alleged drugs offences. He has been linked to the handover of one kilo of cocaine in Cockfosters, London, in May 2013 and the seizure of 24 kilos of cannabis in Colchester in October 2013. A Civil Guard spokesman said: 'He never left his house as a security measure to avoid being arrested.

It was his 38th league goal of the season and with Manchester United loanee Javier 'Chicharito' Hernandez scoring a second this was another win that Real Madrid had wrapped up before half time as they continue their pursuit of leaders Barcelona. Ronaldo had not scored a free-kick since last March but when Luka Modric was fouled 25-yards out in a central position midway through the first half, he dipped a free-kick through the Eibar wall that bounced just in front of Xabier Irureta.

The Eibar goalkeeper was already travelling to his right and when the ball spun like an off-break to the keeper\u2019s left he was left floundering at his near post as the ball crossed the line. Despite his recent poor conversion rate from free-kicks, Madrid\u2019s goal machine has now scored 16 goals from direct set-pieces \u2013 only Roberto Carlos can match that in the last 20 years in Spain. Real Madrid were up against La Liga\u2019s smallest club who were playing a league game at the Bernabeu for the first time in their history. Madrid had Keylor Navas making only his ninth start of the season for the rested Iker Casillas but he was seeing little more of the action that he usually does from the bench in a one-sided first half. Real could have gone ahead after 16 minutes when Ronaldo tried but failed to make contact with an Alvaro Arbeloa cross with an ambitious bicycle kick. The rebound came out to Asier Illaramendi but he hit his shot wide. Ronaldo then forced a corner with a blocked shot and from it Real managed to hit the crossbar, both posts, and had a goal ruled out for offside all inside 10 seconds. Ronaldo flicked the corner kick on to Sergio Ramos who hit the bar with a header. The ball rebounded to Isco whose shot hit one post, rolled along the line and hit the other, before coming out to Hernandez. In the team ahead of the rested Karim Benzema, he scored, but from an offside position. Javier Hernandez made the most of a rare start for Madrid by doubling Madrid's lead in the 31st minute . Hernandez watches on as his header beats Eibar goalkeeper Xabier Irureta (left) It was impossible to come any closer and sure enough Real Madrid scored with their next chance as Ronaldo rammed home that set-piece. He should have doubled the lead a minute later but just failed to reach Hernandez\u2019 cross. Manchester United\u2019s on-loan Mexican has become increasingly frustrated by his lack of chances in Spain. He will not stay beyond this summer but there will be no shortage of clubs interested in a forward whose strike rate is comfortably inside one goal a game. On 31 minutes Arbeloa crossed and he angled a clever and powerful header home to make it 2-0. It was his first goal in the Bernabeu and his fifth for the club. The Manchester United loanee striker celebrates just his fifth goal in Los Blancos colours . The Madrid players celebrate Hernandez's header during the 3-0 victory against La Liga minnows Eibar . Just before half time Marcelo drove forward and laid the ball off to Ronaldo in space. His fierce low shot forced a fine save from Irureta who had performed well since flapping at that spinning Ronaldo free-kick. Real coasted through the second half. They were able to withdraw Modric, Ramos and Marcelo on the hour with thoughts already turning towards Tuesday\u2019s Madrid derby Champions League quarter-final against Atletico Madrid. It was a gamble to make all three changes so early despite the 2-0 advantage and Carlo Ancelotti almost paid for it when on 70 minutes Federico Piovaccari clattered into Pepe who in-turn fell into keeper Navas. Both the keeper and Pepe, who had come on for Ramos, needed treatment but were able to continue. Gareth Bale will also be back for Tuesday\u2019s Champions League first leg. He sat this one out as a precaution after taking a knock on the thigh in midweek. Madrid coped without him and his replacement Jese who scored the third on 83 minutes. He was quiet throughout in Bale\u2019s right wing position but showed strength and skill to work an opening on the right hand edge of the penalty area before burying a shot in Irureta\u2019s far corner.

        "article": "Two trainee obstetricians have been removed from a newly developed $2 million hospital in Western Australia reportedly over  concerns about the quality of service and problems with patient safety at the obstetric unit. The concerns around Fiona Stanley Hospital, in southwest Perth, were revealed to theWest Australian\u00a0by unnamed sources. However, according to health authorities, the move was purely based on reshuffling junior medical faculty. The latest potential developments at the hospital follow recent reports  that blood and bone fragments were found on supposedly sanitised medical instruments. The $2 billion Fiona Stanley Hospital in southwest Perth was found to have blood and bone fragments of some its medical instruments . The West Australian was told junior doctors were moved to 'maximise training opportunities' by a state committee that organises both accreditation and training for the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. The hospital went on 'baby bypass' when the maternity unit opened four months ago, due to an unexpectedly high number of women giving birth.\u00a0The hospital consequently had to direct expectant mothers to other hospitals. This week the RANZCOG told the West Australian that the obstetrics unit, which opened on December 2 last year,\u00a0was approved for  training in March. Michael Gannon, president of the Australian Medical Association WA, told the West Australian he knew of issues surrounding the recently opened obstetrics unit. He said concerns of the unit's services were similar to others at the hospital, due to planning issues from years ago. The hospital was stripped of its medical service provider Serco after they failed to return sterilising equipment by an arranged date in February . Earlier in the week, it was revealed that the hospital's medical service provider Serco failed to return sterilising equipment by an arranged date in February. The company was fined $60,000 and was subject to Department of Health workers auditing its staff, but the hospital was reportedly operating with poorly sanitised instruments, reported the ABC. Australian Medical Association WA president Michael Gannon noted recent reports that some instruments contained blood and human matter. 'There's been reports of bits of bone on some orthopaedic equipment, there's been reports, that are really hard to believe, of blood still being seen on some instruments,' he said. 'So this gives us great concern.'. Dr Gannon said the latest revelations will further damage the hospital's public image and likely cause a loss of morale within its workforce. 'I can't imagine how people must feel if they've got surgery booked at the hospital at some stage,' he said.",

Former model Bianca was targeted by the gang of eight on Tuesday afternoon as the 28-year-old talked on her mobile while walking in Marylebone. The attackers are understood to have grabbed her phone and then attempted to snatch her bag, but ran away when she fought back. Bianca Gascoigne, the daughter of troubled ex-footballer Paul, who was mugged by a gang . Bianca, pictured with Paul and brother Regan, had her phone stolen which reportedly contained private texts . Miss Gascoigne took to her Twitter page after the attack, where she branded her muggers 'lowlifes on bikes' The theft reportedly left her in tears and she is said to have been left devastated given the nature of the texts stored on her phone. According to\u00a0The Sun, she told a friend: 'I was walking across the road and was suddenly surrounded by this gang of eight. They were all hooded up so I couldn't see them properly. It was terrifying.' A friend also told the newspaper: 'She's furious because these lowlifes will be able to go through private texts, some were with her dad Paul.' Bianca later tweeted about the mugging, branding them 'lowlifes'. She wrote: 'Beautiful day shame it just got ruined by being robbed! Got ambushed by a bunch of lowlifes on bikes.' A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'Police were informed of the theft of a mobile phone, which happened at about 3.45pm on Tuesday in Wimpole Road, Marylebone.

Teddy Sheringham joined Gascoigne as he celebrated doubling England's lead against the Scots . Gascoigne adopted Bianca and her brother Mason after he married her mother Sheryl in 1996. They also had a child together called Regan. The couple divorced two years later but Bianca and the former Rangers hero are still said to be close. She has appeared on several reality TV shows including Celebrity Love Island and Celebrity Coach Trip, and currently runs the Gaslight club in central London. Last year, she hit out at Twitter trolls who attacked her saying she should have done more to help her step-father, who has had a well-documented battle with alcohol abuse. It came after he was led away from his home  by police and an ambulance crew following worried neighbours' calls to emergency services. One online bully told the glamour model her step-father was 'done' and another branded her 'attention seeking'. But she hit back, tweeting: 'There are some sick twisted people out there have some compassion don't know why people feel the need to be so nasty & have opinions they know nothing about.'

        "article": "A father-of-two who brushed his ankle against a bin bag, scraping the skin, developed a flesh-eating bug and nearly lost his leg. Douglas Murphy was cleaning up after a children's picnic when he bumped his leg against a bin bag. Though the 47-year-old barely registered it at the time, the scrape almost cost him his right leg. A cut so small it was hardly visible, became infected, causing the rare condition necrotizing faciitis - a flesh-eating bug. So extreme was Mr Murphy's infection, surgeons were preparing to amputate his right leg. But as they were printing out the paperwork to authorise the procedure, the antibiotics Mr Murphy had been given finally began to show signs of working. Douglas Murphy, 47, from Brooklyn, New York, pictured with his daughters Livvy Grace and Eleanor, nearly lost his right leg after scraping it against a bin bag while clearing up after a party . 'I attended a picnic for my daughter's kindergarten class,' said Mr Murphy of Brooklyn, New York. 'The kids played and it was a wonderful day. After the party ended, I helped in the clean up. 'I filled a bag with trash and, as it neared filling, spun the bag so I could tie it off. 'The bag's bottom corner brushed \u2013 and we're talking barely touched \u2013 my ankle and left a little teensie bit of juice on my sock. 'There was no abrasion or anything visible.' That evening, Mr Murphy, who owns a summer camp company, was at home watching a movie with his daughters Livvy Grace, now 13 and Eleanor, now 11, when he began to feel feverish. 'My leg, foot and ankle began to swell and a nasty dark purple began to spread and grow. My temperature was rising, I started feeling awful,' he said. 'I thought it was a spider bite. I made my kids look but they didn't see anything.' By the following evening, his temperature had rocketed to 42\u00b0C and he could put weight on his ankle. He rushed to New York Methodist Hospital and collapsed at the intake desk. Mr Murphy was diagnosed with necrotizing fasciitis and medics battled to save him from the grips of infection. 'For the next few days, I was incoherent, feverish \u2013 completely out of it,' he said. 'The infection spread and my temperature did not go down. I was in deep, deep trouble. A cut so small it was barely visible became infected, triggering the flesh-eating infection, necrotizing faciitis . Surgeons were preparing to amputate his right leg, when they noticed antibiotics given to the father-of-two had begun to work. As a result his leg was saved . 'They didn't tell me how bad it was but apparently told my mum, who flew in and stayed at my bedside, to get my paperwork in order as they might not save me.' As the infection took hold, Mr Murphy began to suffer 'crazy fever dreams', telling his mother he was due to fly via private plane to Tokyo to attend a party hosted by Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. Despite being hooked up to several IV drips and plied with different combinations of antibiotics, Mr Murphy's fever refused to slow. When red infection lines began to shoot over his knee, surgeons decided to prep him for amputation. It was not until they were printing out the paperwork to authorise the operation that the medicine finally began to work. Eventually, the infection was beaten and Mr Murphy was moved to a regular hospital room to recover. 'At first they put me in a shared room and it was really only then that I began to get coherent. 'There was a guy in the bed nearby and his wife sitting at the foot of the bed,' Mr Murphy said. 'They were both staring at me. I looked down at my massive, swollen, disgusting leg with flesh literally falling away, hair a mess, soaked in sweat \u2013 not the person you want to be wheeled into your room. 'Once I moved into a single room and washed up, I began to feel more human. 'My sister stayed in my room day and night and, while wearing gloves, peeled away layer after layer of dead, disgusting tissue.' Mr Murphy said he is grateful to be alive. His foot has now completely healed but still hurts a lot of the time . Mr Murphy was discharged and given crutches, which he found difficult to navigate. On his first day back home, he slipped, broke his hip and was sent back to hospital for a string of orthopaedic surgeries which ended in a total hip replacement. His lymph system was severely damaged following the infection and his foot is now covered in scar tissue. He is keen to raise awareness of his ordeal, working tirelessly with the National Necrotizing Faciitis Foundation. 'When I look at the pictures I have a hard time believing that it's me and I survived,' he said. 'The doctors think that a teensie abrasion from the trash bag and the presence of the bacteria on the bag was enough to let in the infection. The bacteria is present all over the world. 'My foot has healed completely mottled and hurts much of the time but I get used to it. 'It's good to be alive.' Necrotizing faciitis is often triggered by group A streptococci bacteria, pictured . Necrotizing faciitis is a rare but life-threatening infection affecting the deep layers of the skin. It progresses quickly after being triggered by various types of bacteria, including group A streptococcus and staphylococcus. Many infections are caused by organisms already residing on a person's skin. Group A streptococci is a bacteria commonly found in the throat and on the skin. The vast majority of infections are relatively mild illnesses, such as strep throat and impetigo. Occasionally, however, the bacteria can become life-threatening if entering parts of the body where not usually found such as the blood, muscles or the lungs. The bacteria is often spread through direct contact with the mucus of an infected person and through contact with infected skin wounds and sores. Invasive group A streptococcal disease, which may occur when the bacteria gets past the body\u2019s defences, is a severe and sometimes life-threatening infection in which the bacteria has invaded parts of the body, such as the blood, deep muscle and fat tissue or the lungs. Two of the most severe forms of invasive group A streptococcal disease are  necrotising fasciitis and Streptococcal Toxic Shock Syndrome (a rapidly progressing infection causing injury to the major organs). The early signs and symptoms of necrotising fasciitis include fever, severe pain and swelling, and redness at the wound site. The early symptoms of Streptococcal Toxic Shock Syndrome may include fever, dizziness, confusion, low blood pressure, rash and abdominal pain.",

The league leaders were put through their paces at their Cobham training headquarters just a couple of days before a London derby against Arsene Wenger's side. Mourinho has never lost to Wenger in 12 outings, and he will be hoping 13 is not unlucky as well on Sunday as his side look to extend their 10-point lead over the Gunners. Chelsea trained at their base in Cobham on Friday ahead of their game against Arsenal . Chelsea's Spanish midfielder prepares to face his former club Arsenal at the weekend . Didier Drogba has an excellent record against Arsenal and could start up front . Cesc Fabregas will make his first return to the Emirates, but another of Chelsea's summer signings Diego Costa is a doubt for the clash due to injury. That would mean Didier Drogba, who was seen training at Cobham on Friday, or Loic Remy could start up front for Chelsea at the Emirates. At his press conference on Friday, Mourinho said: 'Didier for sure is good, is fine. Remy, not for sure. And Diego, let's make a decision tomorrow. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho takes charge of the training session at Cobham on Friday . Belgian star Eden Hazard is in line to be named PFA Player of the Year this weekend . Dominic Solanke is in reserve, having missed Chelsea's Under 21 team match on Thursday, and will be on the substitutes' bench as back-up to Drogba if Costa is not fit. Costa has scored 19 Premier League goals this season, including one in the 2-0 win against Arsenal in October. But Costa has missed the last two matches - wins against QPR and Manchester United - after a recurrence of the hamstring problems which have plagued him. 'He's a very important player for us, but the reality is we are coping with the difficulties of every match without him,' Mourinho added. Teenage striker Dominic Solanke joined the first team for their training session at Cobham on Friday . Youngster Solanke with Hazard in training ahead of the Arsenal game at the Emirates .

'We played amazingly well during the most part of the season, scoring a lot of goals and controlling games very well through the quality of our possession. 'In the last period we are more strategic, less artistic, but we are having results. I would love Diego to be back, but I trust the other people.'

Mourinho said: 'We just signed a new contract with him (until 2021). We didn't put a gun to his head. He had a lot of time to think about it. 'He made a commitment for the future of the team, signing a very good contract. I don't think he's interested in going.' Mourinho recently said every player has a price.

In a shock new poll that will send shockwaves through Downing Street, the Labour leader has jumped ahead of the Prime Minister in personal approval ratings. The Labour Party has also taken a commanding four point lead over the Tories with just 28 days until polling day, according to the pollsters Survation. Labour leader Ed Miliband has jumped ahead of the Prime Minister in personal approval ratings, a Survation poll has revealed . The revelation comes in the wake of a furious political row over the Labour leader\u2019s personal character \u2013 after the Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said Mr Miliband could stab Britain in the back like he did to his brother. Mr Miliband responded by accusing the Tories of dragging the election campaign \u2018into the gutter\u2019. The Tories have pinned much of their election hopes on turning the campaign into a straight choice between Mr Cameron and the Labour leader. But the campaign could backfire if Mr Miliband overtakes the Prime Minister in the polls. According to tonight\u2019s Survation poll for the Daily Mirror, with less than a month until the general election, Labour has opened up a four-point gap over the Tories. Labour is up 2 points on 35, the Conservatives down one to 31. Nigel Farage\u2019s Ukip, meanwhile, are down three to 15 with the Lib Dems still struggling on just 9 per cent.

Frank Knight, a lifelong supporter of the Seasiders, was ordered to make a public apology after posting a disparaging status on his Facebook page this time last year. Knight currently has 34 friends on his private account and this is the third instance in a matter of months whereby a fan of the club has settled before court proceedings with owner Owen Oyston and his son, chairman Karl. Blackpool fans vent their disgust at the Oyston family, who own the club, last week . Supporters have been protesting against the Oystons before matches and then not attending the games . Another supporter is awaiting a court date with the Oystons after making defamatory remarks online. Karl Oyston is to soon find out his fate for branding a fan a \u2018retard\u2019 before Christmas, telling him to \u2018enjoy your special needs day out\u2019 and claiming he was banned from the ground because he was a \u2018p****\u2019. Blackpool\u2019s recent history has been entrenched in bitter disputes off the pitch, with paying customers regularly protesting at the ownership of their club. That was compounded last week when Lee Clark and his team\u2019s relegation to League One was confirmed. Dozens pelted the Bloomfield Road reception with eggs and flares before their draw against Reading last Tuesday. Blackpool chairman Karl Oyston speaks on his mobile phone during Tuesday's draw with Reading . Owner Owen Oyston watches the match huddled under a blanket in the stands . Blackpool fan Frank Knight posted an apology on a supporters' messageboard on Thursday . A group also travelled to the Oyston home near Waddington, Lancashire on Sunday to vent their fury. Members of the family stood within the grounds and watched as they protested in front of the gates. And Knight\u2019s apology will only serve to exasperate the problem further. Posting on a fans\u2019 messageboard, the pensioner said: \u2018I now regret making these allegations, I fully accept that they are false and I wish to sincerely apologise for them and also for the harm, distress and financial losses my comments have caused both BFC and the Oystons and I wish to unreservedly withdraw them. \u2018I accept that my publication of the allegations on Facebook and in a manner which is readily accessible to users constitutes a very serious libel. It has injured the reputation of the Oystons and has caused them considerable embarrassment and distress. Blackpool's main reception at Bloomfield Road was pelted with eggs before their game with Reading . Broken eggs on the floor outside Bloomfield Road . \u2018It has damaged their reputation in business and it is considered to be grossly defamatory of the position of the Oystons within the Club, within the football hierarchy and within the football community in general, as well as within the local community for it to be even suggested that either or both of the Oystons were not only aware of such alleged activities but also that either or both of the Oystons actually condoned them. \u2018In recognition of this, I have agreed with their suggestion that I should pay to BFC, by way of damages, costs, disbursements and interest and in full and final settlement of all matters in issue between myself and BFC and the Oystons, the sum of \u00a320,000.00. \u2018After a frank discussion with the Oystons, I acknowledge that they are both genuine fans of BFC and they and their families have only the best interests of BFC at heart. I recognise that BFC is now in a significantly healthier situation than when the Oyston family first became involved in it. I note that the combined net assets value at cost of Segesta and BFC were \u00a332 million as at May 2014, compared with -\u00a342,000 as at May 1987, when the Oystons took over BFC.

        "article": "A university undergraduate has claimed that the cost of trying to study in London left her with no other choice than to turn to prostitution. As renting in the capital soared to an average of more than \u00a31,100 per month, the second year history and politics student who attends a London university told how she took up sex work\u2013 even visiting some clients at their workplace. Speaking through the English Collective of Prostitutes', the woman \u2013 who asked to remain anonymous \u2013 spoke after a research project revealed more than a fifth of students have thought about being involved in the sex industry. A University student has revealed how she turned to sex work after her student loan failed to cover her rent (picture posed by model) The survey conducted by the University of Swansea further revealed that nearly five per cent of them had actually worked in the sex industry. The young woman said that she didn't immediately turn to prostitution but used it as a last resort after conventional means of work failed to support her. She said: 'I started working after my first year and tried various part time jobs: in a coffee shop, a pub and as a waitress. None paid enough. 'The student loan didn't cover even my housing, let alone living expenses, food, books and travel costs.' She added that money worries meant she began to struggle academically as well as financially. 'I had trouble keeping up with course work, especially if I worked evenings. 'For example at the pub, I'd earn \u00a37 an hour for an eight hour shift, two nights a week, so I'd bring home about \u00a3100 weekly. 'I'd just moved to London from the north of England. My family are not well off, so cannot afford to help me much. The student says that traditional means of earning failed to cover the cost of living in London . 'I didn't know anyone in London so when I moved here it was starting from scratch.' Initially she lived in student accommodation in the city but says that working as a prostitute enabled her to afford somewhere better. 'It was an overcrowded, noisy flat with other students,' she said of her halls. She moved into her own home after she began to advertise her services. 'I could afford a place of my own. I advertise through a website and have regular clients. 'I visit them at home, in hotels and occasionally at their workplace.' Despite sex work not being an ideal situation the student says that it had been beneficial towards her studies. 'It is flexible and fits around my course. 'I can work the hours I want to and scale back around exam time or if I have extra course work.' The woman heard about sex work from other students who had also been looking for a way to earn extra money. 'In my first year at university I started hearing about students turning to sex work,' she said. 'After a time I met someone on another course who'd been working as a stripper in a bar. 'Through her I met another student doing escorting, she clued me in, said where to advertise, and how to avoid bad clients and work safely. 'She gave me the English Collective of Prostitutes' Rights sheet which tells about the laws and how they work. Although her new means of earning have enabled her to continue studying in London the woman says she does not particularly enjoy her work. 'My biggest worry is about being arrested because if I get a criminal record it would stay with me for life. It would be massive obstacle to getting other jobs.' However she remains adamant that this is the best option for her after seeing other friends trying alternative routes. 'Sex work is far batter paid and suits my time more than any other work I know of. 'Friends at university are working 10 hour shifts for under the minimum wage. Others are working on zero hour contracts and never know how many hours they will get. 'Sometimes they get none at all so it is very hard to budget and pay bills. 'I know students who've dropped out and left courses due to financial pressures.' However she is well aware of the risks she is taking and says she takes appropriate precautions to avoid being found out. 'Mostly students doing sex work don't talk about it. If it comes out, it could affect your future and job prospects.' The student's story may seem like a rare case but she says that it is become more regular practice in universities: 'Since I started escorting I've heard that a former roommate exchanged sex with her landlord to cover the rent. 'Another woman I know worked as a part time sex worker to earn enough to travel home to visit her family. 'Sex work among students is much more common than people think, and it is likely to increase as long as fees, rent and the cost of living is so high.'",

        "article": "Ben Flower was given the honour of leading Wigan's victory song after helping them to a 30-20 win over Warrington on his return from a six-month suspension. The 27-year-old Wales forward did not get among the scorers but he did enough to impress coach Shaun Wane on his first appearance since being sent off in the Warriors' Grand Final defeat by St Helens last October. 'I thought he looked a bit serious, he's not done anything for six months,' Wane said. 'I was a bit apprehensive for him but I thought he played really well - he belted a few people - and he led the song in the dressing room. Wigan Warriors forward Ben Flower takes on Warrington's\u00a0Micky Higham (left) and Roy Asotasi . 'It's good to have him back. He's been vilified in the press but he's a really nice bloke.' The return of Flower dominated the build-up to the Super League derby while the half-time announcement that Sam Tomkins is returning to the club on a four-year contract made it a night to remember for Wane. 'Everything is great,' Wane said. 'It's fantastic getting these players back. We should be very proud. It's a great coup for us, it just shows we do some things right.' On the field, winger Dom Manfredi provided the highlight with his second hat-trick of tries in five days as the Warriors three times came from behind to secure a fourth win in five matches to consolidate third place in the table. Ryan Hampshire, Anthony Gelling and Liam Farrell also touched down while centre Chris Bridge scored two tries for the visitors, who had led 10-0 after 10 minutes. Flower struggles to control the ball as Warrington forward\u00a0Ben Currie lines him up the for hit . 'It was a bit of tick and pass at times, which is disappointing, but I thought our attack was good,' Wane said. 'We gifted them a couple of tries with poor one-on-one misses but it was win at all costs for us and we got the win. 'Competition is driving up the skill levels and we're going to get better. We are going to put a real complete performance in soon.' The defeat leaves Warrington outside the top four but coach Tony Smith was encouraged by his side's performance. 'It was a great effort by both teams and another great game,' he said. 'We produce some of the best games between us but, at the moment, we're coming out on the wrong side of them. 'I think both coaches will be looking for some improvement in defence but some special rugby league was played. Sometimes you've just got to go 'wow', it's pretty hard to stop if they are going to go to those lengths to score tries. Dom Manfredi crosses for a Wigan try despite the attention of Toby King . 'The start of the second half really hurt us, it sapped our energy when they were throwing the ball around like a basketball. 'The second half wasn't great for us but we're heading in the right sort of directions. It takes good performances to beat us. We're much better than a few weeks ago.' Smith had mixed views on the performance of 19-year-old Declan Patton, who was making only his second appearance in Super League. 'His kicking game was sensational and I love it when he's running with the ball but he got ragged around defensively at times,' he said. 'There are some aspects of his game he needs to step up. He learned some harsh lessons there tonight but he's a good kid and will take things in his stride.'",

Reinventing himself as Celtic\u2019s top scorer, the front-page headlines are also less evident. If no one imagines he now spends his days train-spotting, the nights seem a little quieter than they once were. Leigh Griffiths celebrates scoring his third goal of the afternoon against Dundee United on Sunday . Hat-trick hero Griffiths takes the ball home following his heroics against Dundee at Tannadice Park . The 24-year-old (left) embraces his manager Ronny Deila after Sunday's convincing win . \u2018Leigh used to put himself around in the Leith area,\u2019 says Tam Currie, his former coach at boys club Leith Athletic. \u2018Not that he was doing anything off limits. \u2018But I\u2019ve not spoken to him in a good while. Before you would see quite a bit of him round here. But we don\u2019t see nearly as much of him now as we used to.\u2019 It may be a conscious thing. Google the words \u2018Leigh Griffiths and controversy\u2019 in the same search and there are more answers than pubs on Leith Walk. In football people talk and older, wiser colleagues and managers whispered of a player with a reputation for being unmanagable. \u2018There was never any doubt about the boy\u2019s ability,\u2019 says former Dundee manager Gordon Chisholm. \u2018It was the off-field stuff that concerned you. He was a young boy when I had him. He was quiet, withdrawn at times, and wasn\u2019 t exactly the life and soul of the dressing room. \u2018He kept himself to himself - but he couldn\u2019t get back to Edinburgh quick enough. \u2018That seemed to be the case any time he got a day off. Any spare time and he wanted back to Leith to be with his mates, which probably wasn\u2019t a good thing. 'I\u2019m not sure he was doing the right kind of things. I\u2019m sure he is now being guided by the Celtic management team.\u2019 It has taken time, work and effort to get to a point where Griffiths can now boast 14 goals in his last 17 games. Griffiths celebrated his hat-trick with a trophy as he became Celtic's top scorer . Griffiths caused a stir when he first arrived at Hibernian but proved to be a fans favourite in the end . Griffiths celebrates scoring the winning goal for Hibs in the Scottish Cup semi-final in April 2013 . As a child, he stood out in Edinburgh amateur football. But concerns about the impact of his formative years on the company he kept prompted Hibs, his boyhood idols, to reject his talents. \u2018It\u2019s well known he could be a feisty character,\u2019 recalls Tam Currie, a Leith Athletic committee member. \u2018I go back with Leigh to when he was 12 and he was a lad who had to be looked after. \u2018He came from a split family and you take on the role of social worker in that situation. But he was no different from the others in that regard. \u2018He was like any other young lad. He had his troubles with different folk and what not.\u2019 \u2018Troubles with different folk\u2019 is a polite way of summing up his career. Boldly, Neil Lennon took a gamble on signing him for \u00a3900,000 in January 2014. Celtic supporters were underwhelmed. Griffiths had accumulated yet more front-page cuttings from while on loan at Hibernian from Wolverhampton Wanderers following a racism row on social media. The doubts over his perceived shortcomings as a human being were amplified when he returned to Leith \u2013 where else? \u2013 to attend an Edinburgh derby as a Hibs fan. He was in a pub where offensive chants about Hearts and former Tynecastle attacker Rudi Skacel were filmed and posted on the internet. In October, he will stand trial on offensive behaviour at football. When the legal action is concluded one way or the other the SFA will revisit charges of bringing the game into disrepute. Griffiths was Wolves leading goalscorer in January of last year, scoring 13 goals in all . That attracted interest from Celtic though, with the Scottish striker penning a four-year deal with the Bhoys . The potential for embarrassment to Celtic is apparent and, perhaps for that reason, Lennon\u2019s successor, Ronny Deila, appeared to make a judgement the player wasn\u2019t worth the hassle. He was no one\u2019s definition of a Deila 24-hour athlete. Yet the Norwegian\u2019s attitudes to Griffiths began to soften when the player opted to drive three hours to play for Celtic\u2019s development team against Sunderland of his own accord. Within days he was back in the first team, scoring in a 2-1 defeat to Dundee United at Tannadice. In the five months since, he has usurped John Guidetti in the starting XI and is now regarded as Deila\u2019s most potent attacker. \u2018He looks as if he has matured as a player,\u2019 adds Chisholm, now a scout with Sunderland. \u2018He never wanted to be an out-and-out striker when I had him at Dundee. He always drifted out into wide areas. \u2018He still does that, but I think he has improved. His hold-up play and movement is better. \u2018He is playing with good quality players, getting better service and I am hopeful he has turned a corner now.\u2019 Bolton and Hibs wanted Griffiths on loan in the last window. The court case notwithstanding, however, his No 28 Celtic shirt looks a better fit now than it did even three months ago. \u2018He is silencing a few critics now,\u2019 says his former Leith coach Currie, with Griffiths having grabbed his second hat-trick of the season against Dundee United on Sunday. \u2018The Celtic supporters didn\u2019t fancy him much. There were certainly a few doubters there. \u2018People here in this neck of woods was hoping he would end up back at Hibs on loan. \u2018I\u2019m delighted for him it didn\u2019t come to that because I don\u2019t think it would have been a good move for his career. \u2018To be honest, I would take him over Steven Fletcher every time. \u2018He is a better striker. I used to see Fletcher a lot when he played for Hibs and, all round, Leigh is a better player. \u2018I read he still has a trial to go through for the pub incident - but he knows now he has to be on his best behaviour. You have to be to be a Celtic player. \u2018I\u2019ll tell him that if I see him again in Leith. But it looks to me now like he has turned the corner.\u2019",

HSBC was ordered to pay them compensation after the banking industry watchdog found it \u2018relied on untested assumptions, stereotypes or generalisations in respect of age\u2019 in the case. The banking giant was criticised for refusing to grant the \u00a3250,000 loan because the husband would have been over 65 when the 18-year-deal finished, according to The Sunday Times. A couple in their 40s became unusual victims of age discrimination after HSBC rejected a \u00a3250,000 mortgage application because it deemed the husband to be too old . In the first case of its kind, the Financial Ombudsman Service found the lender guilty of being \u2018unfair\u2019. HSBC was ordered to pay \u00a3500 to the couple for their \u2018distress and inconvenience\u2019 over the \u2018unfair application of its age policy\u2019, and was told to reconsider their loan application. Bosses at the bank defended their decision and argued it was \u2018entitled to apply a maximum age policy\u2019, according to ombudsman documents seen by the newspaper. But the ombudsman said: \u2018The bank relied on untested assumptions, stereotypes or generalisations in respect of age.\u2019 The couple, who do not wish to be named, applied for the joint interest-only mortgage over 18 years on their home, in which they held substantial equity. HSBC had issued a decision in principle, indicating that they would be prepared to lend the money, but it then refused to proceed due to the husband\u2019s age. The husband, however, does not plan to retire at 65 and his final salary pension would be large enough to cover the monthly repayments. He also has pension pots and his wife would have been able to pay the loan from her income alone, if necessary. The couple complained and claimed they had been victims of discrimination. The complaint was upheld by the ombudsman - the first time it has done so specifically on the grounds of age for a mortgage. HSBC said its decision was based on its age restrictions for interest-only loans, a type of mortgage that allows borrowers to pay off the interest but none of the capital. HSBC was ordered to pay \u00a3500 to the couple for their \u2018distress and inconvenience\u2019 over the \u2018unfair application of its age policy\u2019, and was told to reconsider their loan application . The bank \u2013 like many other lenders - has tightened its criteria, and does not offer interest-only loans with a term beyond a borrower\u2019s 65th birthday. For repayment mortgages, the age ceiling is 75. The bank told The Sunday Times: \u2018As a responsible lender, we need to ensure our customers\u2019 ability to repay their mortgage. \u2018With interest-only lending we also need to understand how a customer will repay the capital when the mortgage matures. \u2018Regulatory requirements to show responsible lending and the repayment vehicles associated with interest-only loans have become more stringent since this application was made. \u2018It\u2019s important to stress that when we look at a mortgage application we take a number of different factors into account, which includes assessing each customer\u2019s individual circumstances.\u2019 The ombudsman\u2019s decision offers hope for borrowers who have struggled to get mortgages due to strict policies on age and income.",

        "article": "A transgender South Carolina teenager who was told to remove her makeup for a driver's license photo has settled her lawsuit over the incident and a state agency has agreed to handle such cases differently, according to court documents. Under the terms of the settlement, the state DMV is changing its policy on how male and female license applicants may dress or wear makeup in their official photos. Agency employees will also get training on how to handle transgender customers and people who don't identify with either gender. Transgender teen Chase Culpepper, 17, who was born male but identifies as female, was told by DMV officials that she had to remove make-up (left) for her license photo last year (after taking off make-up right). After a legal battle, the policy has been changed and Miss Culpepper was allowed to wear makeup for her ID . The 17-year-old transgender teen won her legal battle against\u00a0the state DMV to appear in her license with make-up and jewelry . Chase Culpepper, 17, who was born male but now identifies as female, regularly wears makeup and androgynous or women's clothing. After passing a driving test last year, she was told by officials at a DMV office in Anderson, about 100 miles northwest of Columbia, to remove her makeup because of a policy that bans license photos when someone is purposefully altering his or her appearance. After several attempts, Culpepper says the makeup was removed to the satisfaction of DMV employees, and a license photo was ultimately taken, a process the teen called degrading and humiliating. Culpepper and the Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund, a New York legal defense group, wrote to DMV officials, asking that Culpepper be allowed to take a new photo. They eventually sued the agency, calling the policy unconstitutionally vague. In a release from the defense fund, Culpepper said she was pleased with the settlement, which also includes a requirement that the DMV officially apologize to her and allow her to take a license photo with her everyday makeup. 'My clothing and makeup reflect who I am,' Culpepper said. 'From day one, all I wanted was to get a driver's license that looks like me. Now I will be able to do that.' Under the settlement, the DMV also agrees to alter its policy to allow people to wear makeup in photos regardless of their gender. DMV officials on Wednesday declined to comment, saying the agency's policy is not to discuss any litigation, even after a settlement is reached. Following the victory, the South Carolina teen said: 'My clothing and makeup reflect who I am'",

The Holland striker\u2019s sharp performance at Craven Cottage suggests he will be in contention to start in Louis van Gaal\u2019s side for the visit of West Bromwich Albion on Saturday. Van Persie missed seven matches after injuring his ankle in mid-February and has only just returned to the first-team picture, replacing Wayne Rooney for the final two minutes of United\u2019s 3-0 loss at Everton on Sunday. Robin van Persie lifts the ball over Magnus Norman to score his second, and Man United's fourth goal . Van Persie made an appearance for Manchester United Under 21s away at Fulham on Tuesday night . The Holland international opened the scoring as United took a commanding first-half lead at Craven Cottage . Joe Rothwell (right) followed up Van Persie's opener with two goals of his own to extend United's advantage . Fulham: Norman; Donnelly, Buatu (c), Baba; Sheckleford, Mesca, Edun (de la Torre 67), Smile, Evans; Plumain, Redford (Humphreys 60) Substitutes not used: Elworthy, Rodak . Scorer: Humphreys 90 . Booked: Sheckleford . Manchester United: Lindegaard; Love, Blackett, Thorpe (c), Kellett; Rothwell (Willock 81). Goss (Fletcher 88), Grimshaw; Pereira, Van Persie (Weir 81), Januzaj . Substitutes not used: O\u2019Hara, El Fitouri . Scorers: Van Persie 13, 80; Rothwell 20, 43 . Booked: Blackett . Referee: Ashvin Degnarain . The primary aim of this appearance was to get much-needed minutes under his belt but his two goals had the added effect of sending United four points clear at the top of the Under-21 Premier League table. Van Persie was undoubtedly the star attraction, but the team fielded by Warren Joyce also included Adnan Januzaj, Tyler Blackett, Anders Lindegaard and Andreas Pereira. And it didn\u2019t take long for the visitors to assert their authority against a Fulham side threatened by relegation from the top tier at this level. On 13 minutes, Van Persie controlled a Pereira through ball just inside the 18-yard box and slotted past Fulham goalkeeper Magnus Norman to open the scoring. It was two shortly afterwards when Januzaj found Joe Rothwell in behind the Fulham defence with a lovely through ball and United\u2019s No 7 was left with an easy finish. The United striker gives a thumbs up to the supporters as he leaves the Craven Cottage pitch . Van Persie emerges from the Craven Cottage tunnel to begin the second half in west London . Van Persie tangles with Fulham's Jonathan Buatu Mananga in the Under 21 Premier League match . Van Persie could have claimed his second five minutes later when he stretched to reach Januzaj\u2019s cross and saw his effort come back off the post. The contest was over two minutes before the break when Januzaj advanced down the right and cut the ball back for Rothwell to place the ball into the bottom corner. The Dutchman saw an effort deflect off Fulham captain Jonathan Buatu and against the crossbar in the second-half but he wouldn\u2019t be denied another goal. 10 minutes from time, he was found behind Fulham\u2019s back line again and added his second of the night with a dinked finish over Norman. It proved to be Van Persie\u2019s last act as he was replaced by James Weir before the restart. Fulham did claim a consolation in stoppage time when Stephen Humphreys headed home Luca de la Torre\u2019s cross.

        "article": "Nigel Farage (above) faced claims of a \u2018cover-up\u2019 last night for censoring a poll that suggests he is on course for a humiliating personal defeat in the General Election . Nigel Farage faced claims of a \u2018cover-up\u2019 last night for censoring a poll that suggests he is on course for a humiliating personal defeat in the General Election. The secret Ukip-commissioned poll, leaked to The Mail on Sunday, shows that Farage has fallen behind his Tory opponent in the Kent seat he is contesting. And he is in danger of finishing third, with Labour catching up fast. If the poll is accurate, it could end Farage\u2019s political career as he has vowed to resign as Ukip leader if he fails to win South Thanet. The ComRes poll was commissioned last month by multimillionaire businessman and former Tory Arron Banks, who defected to Ukip last year and gave the party \u00a31million. Ukip hoped the Thanet poll would echo an earlier one showing Farage heading for a famous victory, and they planned to use it to whip up more support. But when the result came through, Farage had a shock. It showed Conservative candidate Craig Mackinlay, a former Ukip activist, on 30 points, one ahead of Farage, with Labour only one behind. Farage was so alarmed he gave orders for the findings to be hushed up to avoid causing panic in Ukip ranks \u2013 and encouraging his rivals. Ukip officials spent last week trying to deny a cover-up. But yesterday, a spokesman finally admitted it had buried the survey, claiming the results were \u2018unreliable\u2019 and that it was a \u2018rogue poll\u2019. The censored poll is not the only sign that the wheels may be coming off Farage\u2019s bandwagon, nationally and locally. The party won last year\u2019s European elections with a sensational 27.5 per cent of the vote, compared to 24 for the Conservatives. But nationally Ukip\u2019s support is now down to 14 per cent, while the Tories have risen to 34. Ukip hopes of becoming a major parliamentary force received a huge boost when two Tory defectors, Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless, won stunning by-election victories last year in Clacton and Rochester respectively. The poll showed Conservative candidate Craig Mackinlay (left), a former Ukip activist, on 30 points, one ahead of Farage. Above, Mackinlay is pictured with Sol Campbell campaigning . However, the decline in support for Ukip has led to most pundits predicting they will end up with a maximum of five MPs in May. If the censored poll is accurate, Farage may not be one of them, and that will leave Ukip in search of a new leader. Farage raised the Thanet stakes dramatically when he said in his recent autobiography that he would stand down as leader if he loses. \u2018The consequences of me failing to secure a seat for myself in the Commons would be significant for me and the party,\u2019 he wrote. Graphics show the results of the censored Thanet poll (above) and the growing support for the Conservatives (below) \u2018It is frankly just not credible for me to continue to lead the party without a Westminster seat of my own. What credibility would Ukip have in the Commons if others had to enunciate party policy in Parliament and the party leader was only allowed in as a guest?\u2019 He added: \u2018Am I supposed to brief Ukip policy from the Westminster Arms pub? No \u2013 if I fail to win South Thanet, it is curtains for me. I will have to step down.\u2019 If he resigns, Carswell, considered almost certain to retain his Clacton seat, is one of the favourites to succeed him. It could lead to a change in direction for Ukip: Carswell was horrified by Farage\u2019s comments about banning immigrants who are HIV positive. Carswell could face a fight from the more telegenic Ukip Euro MP and former journalist Patrick O\u2019Flynn. David Cameron has made stopping Farage in his tracks in Thanet one of his top Election priorities. The constituency was the first stop last week on Samantha Cameron\u2019s Election tour itinerary. Tory-supporting former England footballer Sol Campbell visited Thanet yesterday to help the anti-Ukip campaign. Ukip has accused the Tories of using \u2018dirty tricks\u2019 against Farage. They rejected claims that photographs purporting to show him drinking in a pub in the constituency were in reality taken in a pub 70 miles away. A Ukip spokesman said the ComRes poll\u2019s headline figures greatly understated Farage\u2019s support because it included people who were not likely to vote and who tended to lean towards the traditional parties. \u2018The poll shows that among those likely to vote, Nigel Farage is seven points ahead of both the Conservatives and Labour in South Thanet.\u2019 A Conservative spokesman said: \u2018The fact that Ukip commissioned this poll but then tried to cover it up when they didn\u2019t like the results shows their true colours.\u2019 ComRes declined to comment. ComRes interviewed 1,003 people in South Thanet between March 13-18.",

Luke Stanwick, 30, is fighting for his life in a medically-induced coma and may never walk again after the 'horrendous' accident in Portugal. The police officer from Hailsham, East Sussex, was on holiday with his wife Jenny and their two-year-old son, Nathan, when he broke his neck. Mrs Stanwick said: 'He is my rock, my hero and most of all the man I adore without question. PC Luke Stanwick, 30,\u00a0has been left paralysed from the waist down after breaking his neck while on holiday with his family, pictured with his two-year-old son Nathan . 'Luke is outgoing and fun to be around and makes me smile every day, even now in our darkest moment together. 'He will fight to the ends of the earth to recover as much as he physically can for both me and our son, as well as the rest of his family.' He remains in hospital in the Portuguese capital, Lisbon, where he was put into a\u00a0coma for extensive surgery. His father, Michael Stanwick, 62, said it was too early to know whether Luke's injuries will leave him permanently disabled. He said: 'Luke's still in hospital, he's suffered a broken neck. He's undergone extensive surgery and he is now in the recovery ward. 'He's undergoing physiotherapy treatment and he is on extensive pain relief. He's able to move his arms now, but it's early doors.

We're trying to get him to the appropriate facilities in this country but we don't know what the damage to the nerve is. 'There is a significant language barrier so it's quite an isolating experience but Luke is very fit, he's a very fit young man and he and I go to the gym together. 'Hearing the news was the most devastating news, we are slowly coming to terms with it. 'It's sad that these shocking things can happen right out of the blue. It brings too much pain to talk about.'

It reached a staggering \u00a35,000 in the first day as colleagues at Sussex Police and officers all over the country rallied together using the hashtag \u00a3MayTheForceBeWithU. Secretary of the Sussex Police Federation Mark White said: 'We were saddened to hear about Luke's accident and have been doing our best to help him and his family. 'It is too early to say how this will affect him in the long run and we still live in hope that he make a full recovery. 'In the meantime, it is heart-warming to see the efforts which are already underway to raise funds to support Luke and his family.' The Bullshire Police Federation, a website for the police community, shared the GoFundMe page and encouraged officers to help Luke on his road to recovery. On the post, Sean Board wrote: 'I worked on relief with Luke. You couldn't wish to meet a more dedicated officer and family man.

        "article": "(CNN)After two days of deliberation, jurors found Dzhokhar Tsarnaev guilty on all counts in the Boston Marathon bombing. The verdict isn't surprising. What might be, however, is the answer to how we prevent this kind of violence from happening again. Because there could be other more young men just like him, which means the lessons we take from Boston will affect whether we can keep America and Americans safer. Today, nearly 1 out of 4 people in the world are Muslim. By 2050, Pew reports, that will be some 1 out of 3. By 2070? Well, I'll quote the all-caps headline reprinted by the Drudge Report: \"Muslims to outnumber Christians!\" Many Americans read such numbers and worry: Will this mean more Dzhokhar Tsarnaevs? But that's only if you believe Islam causes extremism, which many have argued. And that's wrong, of course. On the other hand, there are people who claim Islam has nothing to do with terrorism. Which is true \u2014 and false. Sure, the Islamic faith forbids murder, but there's a small but significant minority of Muslims murdering people in terrible ways, and in Islam's name. Understanding what leads young Muslims like Dzhokhar down a dangerous path requires we understand radicalization. At any given moment in the Middle East, we have little idea who's going to attack whom next, who's on whom's side, how this is going to end, or what anyone's even fighting over anymore. This bad news is going to turn worse before it gets better. But it will get better. To understand why, we have to take a stab at understanding what radicalizes Muslims . Contrary to common belief, Muslims aren't unusually predisposed to violence. Radical Islam, which has taken on an ugly life of its own, began at the intersection of politics, religion and religious identity. Islam is about what you believe, but it's also about being part of a community. And what happens when you are a member of a community and you see it under attack? Some Muslims who have turned to violence have done so with good intentions (the road to hell, after all). Consider: The tragedy of modern Islam is in its endless sequence of tragedies. Before my time, the brutal Soviet invasion of Afghanistan horrified many Muslims. When I was in high school, Bosnia occupied all our attention. There was of course Russia's brutal war on the Chechen people \u2014 Dzhokhar shares his name with a recent Chechen patriot --  and Israel's ongoing occupation of the Palestinian territories. And the blows against Muslims don't end there. There was Serbia's war on Kosovo, another war in Chechnya, the invasion of Iraq, oppression in Myanmar, civil strife in Syria, the colonization of East Turkestan, massacres of Muslims in the Central African Republic, wars on a besieged Gaza and West Bank still under Israeli rule. Imagine how this looks to a restless young Muslim. Countless places where co-religionists have been killed, and nobody seems to do anything about it. Nobody even wants to. Extremists have long offered crude reasons for why the violence was happening, and then moved quickly to a single, tempting, terrible response: Take up arms \u2014 and kill. In her new book, \"Heretic: Why Islam Needs a Reformation Now\", Ayaan Hirsi Ali argues that extremism isn't caused by political circumstances, but by Islam itself. Her conclusion is wrong. To fight extremism, we don't need to reform Islam. We need to show young Muslims that extremism is doing the opposite of what it claimed to. Rather than help Muslims, it's harming them. When I was a teenager, our Massachusetts mosque hosted a delegation from Bosnia that shared graphic, heartbreaking stories of rape, exile, and massacre inflicted on Muslims, all because of their faith. The mosque raised money, collected food, blankets, medicine. Promises were made to provide more, and regularly. But we all knew that wasn't enough. As we left the mosque, my peers and I were disgruntled and confused. Shocked. Angry. Our teachers could've told us: Go and fight. Defend your Muslim brothers and sisters who are under siege. Or they could've told us to keep our heads down and make money and live comfortably. Neither answer would have satisfied. Fortunately for us, they offered us a third way. They showed us, patiently, how to work with others, how to compromise, how to get things done. A more engaged American Muslim community, they explained, could use its resources to help people suffering all around the world. They were right. We saw the dead-end road of radicalism from afar, but we also saw, up close, how communities that isolated themselves and turned inward found themselves powerless, ineffectual and ignored. Thanks to social media, a medium that the world's burgeoning young Muslim population is increasingly comfortable with, more Muslims can and will see this, too. Radicalism will be done in by fellow Muslims who want to save their religion from this monster within it.  It's happening already. Our national conversation about Islam is focused on the wrong issues. Does Islam need a Reformation? What in Islam causes violence?  We would do a lot better if we accepted that Muslims the world over have real grievances \u2014 dictatorships, corruption, foreign intervention, religious illiteracy, lack of economic opportunity -- and radicals exploit these. We need to show the young Dzhokhars that, if they want to help, then violence isn't going to help. To fight extremism, we need to pose this question to young Muslims: \"Do you want to help your brothers and sisters in faith?\"   Because those who claim to be defending us are making things so much worse. Their narrative has failed. Their solution is bankrupt. The Caliph wears no clothes. It's the reason why increasing numbers of Muslims reject extremism -- and not just because our numbers are increasing.",

The reality is more complex, with radicalization being driven by a combination of political, religious, and community factors. Young Muslims who feel their community is under attack may turn to violence with good intentions, but this only perpetuates a cycle of violence and harm. To combat extremism, it's not enough to simply reform Islam; instead, we need to show young Muslims that violence is not the answer and that there are more effective ways to help their communities."

        "article": "Cad: Poet Rupert Brooke had a string of short-lived relationships with various women before he died aged 27 in April 1915 . Poet Rupert Brooke has long had a reputation as a 'young Apollo', a symbol of innocent youth who was cut down in his prime during the senseless slaughter of the First World War. But a new haul of previously unseen letters show that he was in fact a slightly caddish womaniser who had a string of affairs without ever settling down. The documents, brought to light for the first time thanks to a \u00a3430,000 grant, show Brooke's lovers complaining about his refusal to take their relationships seriously. The letters are part of the John Schroder collection, which has spent decades in private hands but will now be available to the public after being bought by King's College, Cambridge, where the poet was a student. Brooke, who died 100 years ago today at the age of just 27, became a semi-legendary figure thanks to his early death and his popular poems such as The Soldier. His obituary was written by Winston Churchill, who called him 'all that one would wish England's noblest sons to be'. However, the letters in the Schroder collection - including 170 documents written by Brooke himself - show a somewhat different side to the great poet. King's archivist Patricia McGuire said that Brooke was 'promiscuous even for a man of his time' and carried on relationships with multiple girlfriends. 'Several women thought he was going to marry them - he may have thought that he was going to,' Dr McGuire told The Times. 'I think he was happy to spend a lot of time with as many women as he could.' Among the lovers whose affairs with Brooke are featured in the letters are Hollywood star Cathleen Nesbitt, artist Phyllis Gardner, and Laurence Olivier's cousin No\u00ebl. Lovers: Cathleen Nesbitt, left, and Phyllis Gardner, right, are among the women who had affairs with Brooke . Popular: Brooke became one of Britain's best-loved poets after his premature death . Nesbitt wrote to Eddie Marsh, Brooke's biographer, saying: 'I've no intention of marrying anybody for years to come - nor, I hope, has Rupert - though I shouldn't be in the least surprised if he settled in the wild with a squaw and a wigwam.' In another letter, she described the poet's care-free attitude in the face of the danger he submitted himself to in the war. Nesbitt wrote: 'When I talked of all things coming to an end he would always laugh and say, \"Hush - there's never any end when things are perfect.\"' This is not the first time that Brooke's reputation has taken a battering - previously discovered letters have shown him expressing unpalatable views on Jews and homosexuals. And this year a book about his affair with Phyllis Gardner revealed that he opposed the women's rights movements and privately said that 'all women are beasts'. The pair bathed naked together near Grantchester, the village outside Cambridge where Brooke lived in the Old Vicarage, now home to Jeffrey Archer. Trove: Peter Jones of King's College, Cambridge with a haul of letters which the college has now bought thanks to a \u00a3430,000 grant . Home: The Old Vicarage in Grantchester, Cambridgeshire, where Brooke once lived . If I should die, think only this of me: . That there's some corner of a foreign field . That is forever England. There shall be . In that rich earth a richer dust concealed; . A dust whom England bore, shaped, made aware, . Gave, once, her flowers to love, her ways to roam, . A body of England's, breathing English air, . Washed by the rivers, blest by the suns of home. And think, this heart, all evil shed away, . A pulse in the eternal mind, no less . Gives somewhere back the thoughts by England given; . Her sights and sounds; dreams happy as her day; . And laughter, learnt of friends; and gentleness, . In hearts at peace, under an English heaven. Despite the recent revelations, Brooke has retained his image as a 'young Apollo' cut down in his prime, whose poems encapsulate typically English scenes. His poem The Soldier, featuring the line 'there's some corner of a foreign field that is forever England', was immensely popular during the First World War, and made even more poignant when Brooke himself died while on active service on April 23, 1915. Churchill wrote in his obituary, published in The Times: 'He was all that one would wish England's noblest sons to be in the days when no sacrifice but the most precious is acceptable, and the most precious is that which is most freely proffered.' Peter Jones, the librarian at King's, said: 'It is hard to realise today just how significant Brooke's impact was 100 years ago. 'In the early 20th century as a poet you were fortunate to sell 200-300 copies of your work. Just after his death, Brooke's close friend and patron Eddie Marsh published 1914 and Other Poems. 'The first edition of 1,000 sold out immediately and, in all, 160,000 copies were sold of various impressions.' He added: 'We now know much more about Brooke as a person and he is certainly more interesting and, in some ways more difficult, than the heroic image portrayed at the time of his death. 'He was a conflicted individual. He had a major breakdown in 1912 and had disastrous relationships with the women who loved him.' One of the letters now made available reveals how Brooke's mother Mary Ruth sought to avoid turning her son into an icon, and also intervened to stop Marsh inserting details of his more sordid relationships. Lorna Beckett, chairman of the Rupert Brooke Society, said: 'He was an interesting, complex and likeable person who is still suffering from the hostile backlash brought about by the \"young Apollo\" myth created straight after his death.'",

        "article": "Faris Al-Khori, 62, was found with\u00a0a hoard of explosive ingredients and recipes for bombs in his flats . A former Syrian doctor has been jailed after police discovered a hoard of explosive ingredients and bomb-making instructions at his home. Faris Al-Khori had dozens of chemicals, poisonous materials, bolts and handwritten notes on how to make a bomb, a court heard. The equipment was\u00a0found purely by chance in April last year after a fire at a block of flats in the Muirhouse area of Edinburgh. Firefighters, who were\u00a0responding\u00a0to a 999 call over a fire within\u00a0a rubbish chute on the 11th floor, had forced entry to a flat registered to Al-Khori and found jars containing various powders. Castor beans, which can be used to make ricin, were also found. The building was evacuated while the police and army Explosive Ordnance Device (EOD) experts were called in to test the substances - some of which were years old. Al-Khori also had a small amount of a highly volatile explosive lead picrate which was so dangerous that the Forensic Explosives Laboratory refused to take delivery of it and it was destroyed. A search was carried out at a further block where the 62-year-old lived with his wife in Leith and a further haul of material was recovered. Both blocks of flats were evacuated and the areas around them sealed off. Al-Khori said the materials were used for cleaning and as fertiliser but in February he pleaded guilty to a breach of the 1883 Explosive Substances Act. Police seized bomb-making instructions and equipment including a bag containing an electrical circuit (pictured) from the properties . Two Coleman's Mustard jars were found being used to store\u00a0a small amount of a highly volatile explosive, lead picrate . Sentencing him to three years and four months in prison, Judge Lady Wolffe said: 'You assembled large quantities without lawful purpose and some were stored in a high rise flat in a densely populated area. 'The number and nature of the explosive substances and the places you chose to store them lead me to conclude there is no alternative to a custodial sentence.' The court heard that\u00a0much\u00a0of the bomb-making equipment, which also included electrical circuits, had been ordered from online retailers. Defence QC Brian McConnachie said: 'What seems to be clear from the narrative and material is that it has been directly ordered from legitimate companies, mainly through Amazon. 'The material has always been delivered to domestic addresses and paid for by genuine credit cards registered to Mr al-Khori. 'It has always been done in the open and over a period of time. Many of the items have never been opened. Al-Khori pleaded guilty to a breach of the 1883 Explosive Substances Act after officers seized dozens of explosive ingredients . 'It is difficult to understand the hoarding of this material but it does appear that he is someone who has some kind of academic interest in the materials. 'It seems he has accumulated materials with some kind of peculiar interest in the subject without ever intending to do anything or make anything.' Detective Superintendent David Gordon, who led the investigation, said: 'This was a significant and complex inquiry for Police Scotland, to safely deal with these volatile items and seek to establish Al-Khori's motives for storing them. 'A thorough investigation by the Organised Crime and Counter Terrorism Unit and Crown Office found no known links to terrorist offences and we believe Faris Al-Khori was acting independently. However, he showed utter disregard for the occupants of both buildings. 'Thanks to the swift actions of our partners in the Fire Service and armed forces, we were able to quickly assess the contents of the flats and make them safe by removing a number of items for forensic examination or controlled explosion. The items from the flats in Edinburgh were discovered by chance during a fire within the rubbish chute which was then evacuated whilst the items were recovered . 'I am also grateful to the City of Edinburgh Council for their work to re-house vulnerable residents whilst we carried out our searches. 'Public safety was at the forefront of our response to this incident and all agencies worked together to minimise any risk to the public. 'Al-Khori's activities went unnoticed for many years, demonstrating the importance of community vigilance in our efforts to keep Scotland safe. 'Counter terrorism is one of Police Scotland's highest priorities, and whilst Al-Khori has no such known links we will always treat all information received with the utmost importance where any risk to the public is identified.' Al-Khori, who was born in Damascus and raised in a Christian family, trained as a doctor in Iraq but has never practised medicine in Britain after arriving here in 1984. He was the full-time carer for his wife, who suffers from schizophrenia, and has had British citizenship since 1998. Police and army Explosive Ordnance Device (EOD) experts had to be called in to remove the explosive materials . Lindsey Miller, the Crown Office's Procurator Fiscal for Organised Crime and Counter-Terrorism, added: 'The conviction of Al-Khori is a good example of agencies working closely together to protect the public. 'Al-Khori possessed a significant number and volume of explosive substances across two properties in Edinburgh as well as recipes for explosives. 'We worked closely with Police Service of Scotland and other agencies to prepare the case to ensure that Al-Khori was brought to justice.' 'I want to reassure the people of Scotland that we take any such offences extremely seriously, and our specialist prosecutors will continue to treat them as an absolute priority.'",

Mohammad Liaqat even assaulted the headmaster during the rampage in which he hurled insults at white teachers in front of shocked parents as they picked up their children. The 34-year-old objected to the strict uniform policy at Mount Carmel High School which stated that pupils could not have beards. Liaqat launched into a 'racist tirade' at white members of staff after 14-year-old boys were told they could not keep their facial hair, police said. After being arrested, Liaqat was told to stay away from the school, so went to another  school nearby where he continued his rant. When Jeff Brown, headmaster of St Oswald's Roman Catholic Primary School, asked him to move on, Liaqat shoulder barged him, Burnley Crown Court was told. He has a child at the secondary school in Accrington, Lancashire, but was not related to the two 14-year-olds who wanted to have facial hair for religious reasons. Liaqat launched his first outburst even though the situation involving the students\u2019 beards had already been resolved at Mount Carmel. During a three-day trial this week, Liaqat was found guilty of one count of assault and five counts of racially or religiously aggravated behaviour. He was remanded into custody at Burnley Crown Court and will be sentenced in June. Mount Carmel school said the ruling on beards was part of the school's dress code, but the 14-year-olds wanted to keep their facial hair for religious reasons. After being taught in isolation for breaking the school rules, Mount Carmel governors decided that the students could keep their beards so long as they signed up to a programme at their mosque to show their faith. After the trial, Xavier Bowers, headteacher at Mount Carmel said: 'We are pleased that justice has been done in this instance. 'My staff were simply doing their job at the time, supervising our children leaving school and making sure they were safe. 'Without provocation, they were verbally assaulted and abused in front of the children and parents. 'We always try to work towards good relationships with our families. This was an unfortunate incident, but we can now draw a line under it and move on. We are largely a happy school and we have good relationships with our local community.' Mohammad Liaqat racially abused teachers at Mount Carmel Roman Catholic High School (pictured) in Accrington after Muslim students were told they could not grow beards . Liaqat then moved on to another school, where he assaulted the headteacher after he was asked to leave, Burnley Crown Court (pictured) heard . Mr Brown, from St Oswald's school, said: 'I am glad this matter has now been concluded and I am looking forward to getting back to concentrating on school life.' PC Dave Hall, from the hate crime and cohesion unit at Lancashire Police, said: 'Ultimately, the issue at Mount Carmel was amicably resolved, but Liaqat decided to take it upon himself to stage his own personal protest. 'He racially abused several of the school staff and he kept referring to Mount Carmel as a racist school. He went on a racist tirade towards the white members of staff. He made it quite clear he was deeply upset. 'After being arrested, he was released on bail. He decided to vent his fury at St Oswald's Primary. 'He had reason to be there but not to behave in the way he did. 'Liaqat was causing problems, which led to the headteacher asking him to leave the premises. He reacted by racially abusing staff there and assaulting the head. 'What he did was completely unacceptable. Whatever his motives, we cannot accept this kind of behaviour.' Liaqat was remanded in custody and will be sentenced in June. Although growing a beard is not obligatory under Islam, the Prophet Mohammed is thought to have had one and worshippers seek to emulate this tradition.",

        "article": "(CNN)Indonesia has a tough stance on drug smugglers, and since assuming office in October, President Joko Widodo has made it clear he intends to show no mercy toward those found guilty of such crimes. That tough stance casts a further pall on two Australian drug smugglers, part of the so-called \"Bali Nine.\" They are waiting to learn whether they will be put to death by firing squad after an Indonesian court rejected a last ditch effort to gain clemency from Widodo on Monday. April marks a decade on death row for Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran for their part in a failed heroin smuggling plot. The 31-year-old Chan has been called the ringleader and 33-year-old Sukumaran has been described as his collaborator.  The seven others who took part in the operation are serving lengthy prison sentences for trafficking the drugs. The members of the Bali Nine were arrested after Indonesian police received a tip from Australian Federal Police. Four members of the group were caught at Denpasar International Airport with more than 8 kilograms of heroin strapped to their bodies.  Four others, including Sukumaran, were arrested at a hotel in the village of Kuta.  Although he wasn't carrying any drugs, Chan was detained after boarding a plane to Sydney.  He was named by others as the mastermind of the smuggling plot. While the purported ringleaders have received media attention for years, the other seven members of the Bali Nine have rarely been in the spotlight. Here's a quick look at the other members of the group: . Scott Rush . Indonesian prosecutors asked for and received a sentence of life in prison for several of the Bali Nine, who were identified as drug couriers in the operation. That includes Scott Rush of Brisbane, Australia. Rush was 19 when he was captured in Indonesia. He was arrested at Denpasar Airport with more than 1 kilogram of heroin strapped to his body. Michael Czugaj . Life in prison was the original sentence for 29-year-old Michael Czugaj, also of Brisbane. Nineteen at the time of his arrest, Czugaj is one of five of the Bali Nine whose sentence was reduced to 20 years in prison, then reinstated at life again.  During his trial, Czugaj testified he was lured into the drug scheme with the promise of a free holiday to Bali. He was quoted in news reports as saying his life was threatened, as well as his family's, if he refused to cooperate with the heroin smuggling operation. Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen . Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen from Brisbane, who is now 31, was one of four drug couriers in the case. He was found in a hotel room on Bali's Kuta Beach with a small amount of heroin and drug paraphernalia. Si Yi Chen and Matthew Norman . The others are Si Yi Chen, 30 and Matthew Norman, 28, both from Sydney.  Foreignprisoners.com quotes Chen as saying he deeply regrets his actions and did not mean to hurt others, especially his family.   Norman is quoted on the same website expressing remorse for his actions and hopes that people back home, \"don't judge me too harshly.\"  He says he has two sisters including a twin. Foreignprisoners.com is run by Foreign Prisoner Support Service, a nonprofit organization based in South Africa. Martin Stephen and Rena Lawrence . The same website details information about Martin Stephens, now 39, and the only woman in the Bali Nine, 37-year-old Renae Lawrence. Stephens was a former bartender from Towradgi, a suburb of Wollongong in New South Wales. He claims he was forced to travel to Bali and take part in the drug smuggling operation after death threats against his family. Lawrence, from Newcastle in New South Wales, Australia, was arrested with heroin strapped to her body.  She claims Chan threatened her life if she did not take part in the scheme.  During her court appeal, Lawrence apologized to Indonesia for her actions.  Her original life sentence was also reduced to 20 years. During a court appearance in 2006, Chan denied threatening anyone.  He told the Denpasar District Court before his sentencing in February of that year:  \"A lot of lies have been said against me, but the true reality is I'm not what people put me out to be. I've never threatened anybody in my life.\" The Denpasar District Court also dismissed claims that Chan made threats against Lawrence and Rush when the two were sentenced in 2006. Australia has repeatedly called for clemency for Chan and Sukumaran. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said Monday, \"The Government is disappointed at today's decision by the State Administrative Court of Jakarta to reject the appeals of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran. We understand that the legal team for Mr. Chan and Mr. Sukumaran is considering other legal options.\" In a news release posted to the Australian government's website, Bishop cited the \"extensive rehabilitation\" both men have undergone and said she will continue to appeal to her counterpart while Australia continues to \"use all diplomatic options to seek a stay of execution.\"",

        "article": "A Russian military analyst has said that his country should develop weapons that can cause a nightmare scenario of tsunamis and volcano eruptions in the US, potentially killing hundreds of millions. Konstantin Sivkov, who writes a column for the Military-Industrial Courier, wrote earlier this month  that Russia needed new 'megaweapons' to unleash chaos and guarantee destruction of its enemies. In an article titled 'Nuclear Special Forces' he said that Russia should develop nuclear weapons manned by a small force that can cause tsunamis on the US coasts and force a volcano in Yellowstone National Park to erupt. Scroll down for video . Konstantin Sivkov, a Russian military analyst, has said that his country needs to develop a new nuclear deterrent against the US . Sivkov wrote a column in the Military-Industrial Courier that Russian should develop a small force of megaweapons \u00a0that can cause tsunamis and seismic activity at Yellowstone National Park (pictured) He said that the main objective of the new system would serve as an asymmetric threat against the US, which is 'moving to the borders or Russia' Sivkov headlines sections of his article with headers such as 'Specifications for Megaweapons', 'One Day Without America,' 'The Day After Tomorrow' and 'The Apocalypse- Simply and Cheaply' The Russian analyst reasoned that because 80 per cent US population lives near the coast, generating tsunamis on the San Andreas fault and in the Atlantic would be an effective way of causing massive damage to 240 million people. He references Hurricane Katrina's impact on New Orleans and says that detonating nuclear bombs near the bottom of the ocean would create waves almost a mile high that would sweep inland. The military man says that all the seismic activity could release another wave that would wipe out the US's European allies. Sivkov,\u00a0the president of the Academy of Geopolitical Problems, says that Russia's large inland territory in Siberia will protect it from receiving too much harm. He raises the stakes for the apocalyptic scenario even further by saying that the tsunami could trigger the Yellowstone Caldera, a supervolcano that last exploded 640,000 years ago. Triggering the Yellowstone Caldera, which hasn't erupted in 640,000 years, would spread ash across the country. Above, a map from the United States Geological Survey predicts the amount of ash from the blast . Sivkov says that triggering the supervolcano at Yellowstone would cover most of the US in ash and serve as an asymmetric weapon. Above, Mammoth Hot Springs at the park . The explosion would then unleash  feet of volcanic ash over all of the United States. According to Sivkov, Russia could also trigger just the volcano with a 'relatively small' megaton blast because it has shown signs of activity. Sivkov said that the normal nuclear deterrent was not good enough and too expensive given Russia's economic problems. While he is convinced of his idea, it remains to be seen if the tsunami and the litany of destruction that followed would be even be possible if the world came to nuclear war. The journal that the analyst writes for is a niche publication with less than 2,000 fans on the Russian social network VKontakte. He may not have the ear of President Vladimir Putin, but Sivkov has a history of making attention-grabbing statements about Russian military affairs for state-backed media. Sivkov said that his new nuclear deterrent idea could be deployed from one ship and could be ready within ten years. He has  imagined potential war between the US and Russia before, telling the pro-Kremlin Independent Newspaper that military games in eastern Russian north of Japan were 'intended to simulate a response to a hypothetical attack by Japanese and US forces.' His other articles in VPK repeatedly call for bigger and more powerful weapons for the Russian military and he has bemoaned Russia's lack of military spending compared to the US, according to the\u00a0Moscow Times. Sivkov said that detonating nuclear bombs on the ocean floor could generate deadly tsunamis and cause massive damage to the US population. Above, devastation after the 2011 tsunami that hit Japan . State-run television presenter Dmitry Kiselyov (pictured receiving an award at the Kremlin) said last year that \u00a0Russia is 'the only country in the world capable of turning the USA into radioactive dust' Russians' once positive views of America have slid sharply since the beginning of rising tensions between Moscow and Washington over Syria and Ukraine. In January 81 per cent of residents said they had a very bad or generally bad view of the US. Imagining America turned to ashes is a frightening thought, though Sivkov's article was not the first time that it had been floated recently in Russia. During the beginning of the Ukrainian crisis and Russia's annexation of Crimea, state-run television presenter Dmitry Kiselyov said that President Obama's gray hair was because of worries about Russian nuclear weapons. He said that Russia was 'the only country in the world capable of turning the USA into radioactive dust.'",

        "article": "The federal government has pledged to scrap the religious exemption from welfare benefits in an attempt to crackdown on parents who choose not to vaccinate their children. Under the tough new 'no jab, no pay' laws, Social Services Minister Scott Morrison has announced on Sunday that parents will no longer be able to access childcare benefits simply by signing a form that says\u00a0they object to immunisation based on 'personal, philosophical or religious' reasons. Parents who refuse to immunised their children\u00a0are set to lose up to $15,000 a year for every child when the changes come into force from January 1, 2016. Meanwhile, families who do vaccinate\u00a0their kids are eligible for the $7,500-a-year childcare rebate, $200-a-week\u00a0childcare benefit and the $726 Family Tax Benefit Part A end of year supplement. Scroll down for video . The government has announced they\u00a0will strip parents of welfare benefits if they don't immunise their kids . The 'conscientious objector' exemption on children's vaccination has been effective since the Howard Government, but after meeting with religious organisations, Mr Morrison said payments will be cut off if parents don't immunise their kids. 'We have had discussions with the Church of Christ, Scientist and have formed the view that this exemption is no longer current or necessary and will therefore be removed,' Minister Morrison said. 'Having been informed the religion is not advising members to avoid vaccinating their children and following engagement with members, the government no longer sees that the exemption is current and the authorisation for this exemption has been withdrawn. 'Having resolved this outstanding matter the government will not be receiving nor authorising any further vaccination exemption applications from religious organisations. 'The only authorised exemption from being required to have children immunised in order to receive benefits is on medical grounds. 'While parents have the right to decide to not vaccinate their children, if they are doing so as a vaccination objector, they are no longer eligible for assistance from the Australian Government.' Minister for Social Services Scott Morrison has announced the end to religious exemption on children\u2019s vaccinations for access to childcare benefits . Parents who refuse to immunised their children are set to lose up to $15,000 a year for every child . The announcement comes after Mr Morrison said while immunising children against deadly diseases protects the wider society, it should be a prerequisite to receive tax payer money. 'We've got to think about the health and well-being of all the other children that are put at risk, and it's their health that also matters,' he said. 'And in fact, you know, those parents have taken decisions to immunise their children, and that's obviously the sensible thing to do. We're a free country, and we're for free society, but that doesn't mean you get to take taxpayers' money if you don't want to go along with the rules.' While doctors and pro-vaccination groups are tipped to welcome the reforms as a way to increase the number of children being vaccinated, some immunisation experts are worried the move won't bolster immunisation rates. Currently around 39,000 children under the age of seven are not vaccinated.

The White House said today that Bernard would depart after a state dinner next month held in honor of the Japanese Prime Minister, confirming rumors that Bernard, 53, would soon exit the administration. The first lady said in a statement she was 'lucky to have such a talented individual on my team.' 'I am equally lucky to have made a lifelong friend in Jeremy,' she added. 'Jeremy will be missed, and Barack and I wish him the very best in all of his future endeavors.' The first lady, pictured here in November 2011 with White House Social Secretary Jeremy Bernard in Hawaii, said in a statement she was 'lucky to have such a talented individual on my team.' Obama added, 'I am equally lucky to have made a lifelong friend in Jeremy' The White House did not name a replacement for Bernard, who is also the first gay man to hold the position, nor did it explain why he was leaving. Michelle Obama spoke highly of his time on staff, however, saying, 'For the last four years, Jeremy has worked tirelessly to open the doors of the White House to as many people as possible and to make each and every event in the White House one to remember, not only for Barack and me, but for the tens of thousands of guests who pass through our doors each year.' Bernard simply stated that it's been an 'honor' to serve the Obamas and lauded the first lady for welcoming 'every guest to the White House with her signature warmth, grace and style.' 'I feel so privileged to have worked for such an extraordinary President and First Lady,' his statement read. The former California resident told the Washington Post that he planned to return to The Golden States, and he's 'really looking for some time to think about what\u2019s next and spend some quality time with Garbo, my rescue beagle.' Bernard is pictured here catching snowflakes on the Colonnade of the White House in this February 2014 photo captured by the building's official photographer. The White House today confirmed that\u00a0Bernard, 53, would depart after a state dinner next month . According to a profile of Bernard in Vogue, Bernard stumbled into politics in the early '90s while waiting tables in Los Angeles. There he met a fundraiser for then-Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton, Dave Mixner, who brought him under his wing and into Clintonland. Bernard later formed a California-based political consulting firm with his ex-boyfriend, Democratic operative Rufus Gifford, that became the vehicle for Barack Obama's West Coast fundraising during his first campaign for president. Obama rewarded Bernard for his hard work with an appointment as the White House's liaison to the National Endowment for the Humanities. He briefly served as the chief of staff to the U.S. Ambassador to France in 2010 before accepting the position of social secretary the following year with his boss' blessing. Barrier-breaking Bernard has served quietly as social secretary since February 2011, carefully avoiding the limelight, unlike his predecessor\u00a0Desir\u00e9e Rogers, the first African-American social secretary, who was forced out of the administration after just 13 months on the job. It was during Rogers' tenure that socialites Michaele and Tareq Salahi crashed a White House state dinner in 2009. The couple went on to start in Bravo's Real Housewives of D.C. reality TV series. No such mishaps happened during the tenure of Bernard, whose behind-the-scenes work kept the White House in shipshape during social events. His first interview since taking the job, the Vogue profile, did not hit newsstands until February of this year - his fourth anniversary as social secretary. Asked for the interview why he believes he was chosen for the job, Bernard said, 'I would imagine part of it is a trust issue. I was there from the beginning. I was a known quantity. They certainly knew that I was loyal and supportive.' This March 18 photo shows, from left to right, Jeremy Bernard, Democratic operative Karen Finney, Executive Director of the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities Rachel Goslins, and former Obama administration officals Stephanie Cutter at the ELLE and HUGO BOSS Women in Washington Power List Dinner at The Residence of the German Ambassador. Barrier-breaking Bernard has served quietly as White House social secretary since February 2011 and has carefully avoiding the limelight for the better part of his tenure . Under Bernard's watch, the White House has moved from formal printed invitations for many events to an email system. It has also shed the tradition of seating husbands and wives away from each other at dinners. Bernard told Vogue his team had received 'some criticism' for departing from the traditional seating chart, but it done in accordance with the first lady's will. 'it does bring a comfort level,' he said, of husbands and wives being allowed to sit together. 'And I believe that was part of what Mrs. Obama wanted. 'It is still the White House, still very historic and traditional, but it doesn\u2019t have to be uncomfortable.' Speaking to the Washington Post about his impeding departure, Bernard summed up his work as making 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue 'as open as possible and to grant access to as many people as possible, especially people who had never been to the house before.' 'It\u2019s easy to fall into patterns, and what Mrs. Obama has been able to do is have an attitude that keeps it fresh,' he said. At the time of the Vogue interview, which was conducted over several months, dating back to the beginning of November even though it was not published until February, Bernard claimed not to know what his next professional move would be and said he was focusing on the last two years of the Obamas' residency in the White House. 'The good thing about this job\u2014and perhaps the bad thing\u2014is that I am not able to think about the future,' he said. Bernard said that a previous White House social secretary told him 'she lost sleep toward the end because people told her she would go on to do great things next, but they never told her what.' 'She warned me that I do have to start thinking about it,' he recalled.\u00a0'I know I do; I just haven\u2019t yet. I\u2019m sort of putting my head in the sand.'",

        "article": "Neanderthals may have eaten recently deceased friends and family either for food or in bizarre funeral rituals. This is according to marks found on the fossils of two adults and a child unearthed in the French region of Poitou-Charentes. Similar marks have been seen at other Neanderthal sites showing how our ancestors cut and fractured the bones of their dead relatives. Neanderthals may have eaten deceased friends and family either for food or in bizarre funeral rituals. This is according to cuts seen on a number of fossils dating back 57,600 years. Pictured is cuts on a forearm bone . Since the Marillac site in France was unearthed, the discovery of fossil remains of animals, humans and tools has allowed the site to be identified as a hunting area for Neanderthals. The latest study has, for the first time, studied the bones of three individuals found between 1967 and 1980 at the French site dating back some 57,600 years. These are an incomplete diaphysis \u2013 or the middle part of long bones - of a right forearm bone, another of a left leg bone and the majority of a right thigh bone. The latter belonged to a child. When compared to the remains of other Neanderthals and modern humans, scientists found bone marks made shortly after death. Cut marks seen on the thigh bone of the Neanderthal child.\u00a0Mar\u00eda Dolores Garralda, professor at the Complutense University of Madrid, and lead authors told SINC: 'Some Neanderthal groups cut and tore apart child or adult corpses shortly after death using lytic instruments' Several years ago, Spanish researchers came up with a dramatic new theory for the end of the Neanderthal - that humans ate them. The researchers point out we have already contributed to the extinction of 178 large mammals. They are now involved in further research on the bones of Neanderthal man to look for signs of human tooth marks. 'Except in its native Africa, in the other continents Homo sapiens can be considered as an invasive alien species,' write researchers Policarp Hortol\u00e0 and Bienvenido Mart\u00ednez-Navarro of the Universitat Rovira i Virgili in Tarragona, Spain. 'The only manner to test it is to find direct evidences of modern human eating marks on Neanderthal remains, such cut or broken marks on bones in artifacts made by modern humans,' he said. The team believe that as Homo Sapien spread into Europe and Asia, where Homo neanderthalensis was, it was treated just another food source - and a competitor. Mar\u00eda Dolores Garralda, professor at the Complutense University of Madrid, and lead authors told SINC: 'Some Neanderthal groups cut and tore apart child or adult corpses shortly after death using lytic instruments.' The thigh bone fragment, which appears to be from a child who died at the age of 9 or 10, shows two large cut marks half a centimetre apart. From its state of preservation, the researchers suggest that the bone was fractured when still fresh with the aim of separating the upper and lower extreme of the thigh bone, where the joints are located. The upper edge exhibits marks of a 'post-mortem' impact with markings that do not follow natural separation of the bones. The lower region had a clear, oblique spiral break which seems to have occurred while the bone was fresh. 'Given the morphology of the fractures, it may be that the body of this child was manipulated shortly after death,' Professor Garralda said. 'The right leg received a series of blows that fractured the femur, and the cut marks identified are anthropic in nature; in other words, there is no visible evidence of animal bites.' The bones of the two adults show these and other markings. The fragment of the radius, possibly belonging to a man, also has small, fine cut marks made with flint tools shortly after death. 'The most significant are three striations together crossing over each other while the bone was still fresh,' the study says. In the leg bone, although the fresh fractures of both extremes can be seen, there are also signs of damage at the lower end.But 'there is no evidence of cut . Similar marks have been seen at other Neanderthal sites showing how our ancestors cut and fractured the bones of their dead relatives . As for the leg bone, although the fresh fractures of both extremes can be seen, there are also signs of damage at the lower end. But 'there is no evidence of cuts or traces of carnivores' teeth,' the researcher insists. The expert remains cautious regarding the of cannibalism, due to the large number of animal bones found on the site . 'They might have been rituals \u2013 still in the 21st century these continue in certain parts of the world \u2013 or for food \u2013 gastronomic cannibalism or due to need,' the authors claim. 'To date we have been able to demonstrate these manipulations at several Neanderthal sites in Europe, which are of course much more recent, including in groups of contemporary humans, but we have not been able to demonstrate the consumption of human meat by Neanderthals,' Professor Garralda said. The expert remains cautious regarding the of cannibalism, due to the large number of animal bones found on the site. The discovery was made in the\u00a0French region of Poitou-Charentes\u00a0in south-western France .",

        "article": "Murder-accused teenager Heather Mack was today given the star treatment in the Bali prison where she is being held over her mother's death. The \u2018body in suitcase\u2019 teen and her baby received a personal visit from a government minister who offered extra comforts. Mack, 19, from Chicago, could spend 15 years in jail for the murder of her mother, 62-year-old socialite Sheila von Wiese-Mack, whose body was then stuffed inside a suitcase. Scroll down for video . Behind Bars: Heather Mack has been keeping her baby with her in a crowded cell in Bali's Kerobokan prison . Yasona Laoly, Indonesia\u2019s Justice and Human Rights Minister, has offered Mack the chance to place the baby with a family to care for the child . Indonesia\u2019s Justice and Human Rights Minister called in unexpectedly at Kerobokan Prison to visit the teen . Yasona Laoly, Indonesia\u2019s Justice and Human Rights Minister, called in unexpectedly at Kerobokan Prison, where the 19-year-old  is caring for  baby Stella. He checked on the conditions in her cell, which she shares with eight other prisoners. \u2018I\u2019m not happy to be raising my baby here,\u2019 said Mack, who is expected to learn on Tuesday whether a panel of judges will agree to prosecution demands that she should serve 15 years for the murder. The minister later said he was perturbed that a three-week-old baby should start her life in a prison. He said he had offered Mack the chance to place the baby with a family to care for the child. \u2018I\u2019ve given her the chance to think over the offer,\u2019 Mr Yasona said outside the prison. \u2018There are families in Bali who would be happy to take the baby in and care for her. \u2018While she is considering this, I have also told her that I will arrange for her to have a room to herself inside the prison where she can care for the baby properly without other prisoners being around.\u2019 Motherhood: Little Stella Schaefer is being cared for in prison by Heather Mack, 19, who is accused of murder . Allegations: Heather Mack is accused of the murder of her socialite mother, Sheila von Wiese-Mack (pictured) Locked up:\u00a0Mack, from Chicago, could spend 15 years in jail for the murder of her mother, 62-year-old socialite Sheila von Wiese-Mack . Judges have accepted the prosecution's case of Mack's guilt for the murder of her mother in a luxury Bali hotel last August. During the minister\u2019s visit, Mack not only told him of her concerns about the crowded cell, but she also said she wanted baby Stella Schaefer - named after her  boyfriend Tommy Schaefer, 21 - to be baptised. Mr Yasona said he would make arrangements for a church pastor or priest to come to the prison to perform a  ceremony. It is understood that Schaefer - who is facing 18 years in jail after admitting  he beat Mrs Mack about the face and stuffed her body in a suitcase after she allegedly attacked him - has not been made aware of the offer to have the baby he has fathered given to a Balinese family. It is expected, however, that Mack will ask for a message to be passed to him in another part of Kerobokan prison seeking his reaction to the offer.

The two men, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, are anxiously waiting for the result of a final appeal in the Indonesian constitutional court to avoid the firing squad. Mr Yasona had said earlier that \u2018we are ready to carry out the executions\u2019. However, he has also displayed a lenient attitude to prisoners, putting forward a plan to parliament to revise the treatment of inmates serving time for corruption, terrorism and drug offences.

But not everyone was smiling after Sir Paul McCartney married Heather Mills. Take a closer look at Macca's wedding party picture and you'll spot his daughters Stella and Mary looking decidedly glum. Scroll down for video . The pair \u2013 daughters of Sir Paul's first wife Linda, who died of cancer four years previously \u2013 were said to have been less than overjoyed by their father's choice of partner. The remarkable picture is a portent of the bitterness that would follow the wedding in 2002 \u2013 as Sir Paul and Ms Mills separated in 2006 and went through a bitter and messy divorce in 2008. Astonishingly, the image is the first to emerge of the former Beatle and Ms Mills from their wedding reception. In another never-before-seen picture, Sir Paul acts out a mock striptease in front of his delighted bride during the reception, which was attended by 300 guests. Sir Paul, then 59, and Ms Mills had ordered a media blackout of the event in Ireland. These pictures belong to the family of Sir Paul's late housekeeper Rose Martin, who was among those invited to the event at the 17th Century Castle Leslie in County Monaghan. The ceremony was shrouded in such secrecy that on the invitations guests were told only to arrive at a hotel at Heathrow Airport at an appointed time from where they would be flown to an unnamed destination. Other guests included the only other surviving Beatle, Ringo Starr, the band's legendary producer Sir George Martin, Pretenders singer Chrissy Hynde, and model Twiggy.

Kind act: Pope Francis washes inmates' feet at Rebibbia prison in Rome yesterday after holding a Holy Thursday Mass for inmates . In what has become an annual Maundy Thursday tradition, Francis washed the feet of 12 prisoners detained at Rome's Rebibbia prison, including a transsexual . The Catholic church has imposed a ban on 'salutes' paying respect to mafia bosses during Easter Sunday's religious processions. In many Catholic countries, floats bearing statues of religious icons are carried round villages during Holy Week. In the south of Italy, the mafia exhibit their power through the approval of bishops and priests which allow them to gain influence and portray their members as close to the church. Last year processions were suspended in several southern towns after religious parade of worshippers bearing a statue of the Madonna in the town of Oppido Mamertina stopped to perform a 'bow' of homage at the house of a mafia godfather serving life imprisonment under house arrest for murder. Pope Francis has said that mafiosi are 'excommunicated' from the Church, and has called on them to convert or else go to hell. He ordered priests to be bolder in openly condemning the mob. One of Italy's southern bishops have issued a decree that those chosen to carry a statue of the Madonna 'should be chosen, under the direct responsibility of the parish, from among the faithful who regularly go to Sunday Mass and who are of proven Christian faith'. Bishop Francesco Milito, who presides over Oppido Mamertina, among other mafia-afflicted towns, said that the route taken by the appointed bearers must be vetted adding. 'We are determined to claim back, and indeed purify, this form of popular devotion, which is particularly connected to Holy Week.' Bishop Luigi Renzo, of the nearby diocese of Mileto-Tropea-Nicotera, said there needed to be 'definitive signs of a break with certain improper events of the past'. Icons and religious relics should only be carried by 'those known in the parish who are truly committed to walking the path of faith'. Anyone 'who is on trial for mafia association or who has a conviction' is automatically banned, unless they have publicly repented and expressed regret'. Mafia prosecutors have warned that Francis' life could be at risk from criminal organisations who are troubled by his clean up of corruption in the Curia and reform of the Vatican bank.",

        "article": "A San Antonio man who fatally shot a SWAT team member with the officer's own gun more than 14 years ago was executed on Wednesday. Manuel Garza Jr. received a lethal injection of pentobarbital for killing San Antonio Police Officer John 'Rocky' Riojas in February 2001. He is the sixth convicted murderer to be put to death in Texas this year. The U.S. Supreme Court had refused in November to review his case, and no last-day appeals were filed before his execution. Manuel Garza Jr. was given the death sentence after killing San Antonio Police Officer John 'Rocky' Riojas in February 2001 . Asked to make a final statement, Garza said he was sorry for causing pain to his family, friends and 'especially police officers'. 'Y'all probably hate me,' he said, looking at three friends of his victim, dressed in their navy blue San Antonio police uniforms. He wished them 'peace and love and hope y'all find God like I have and I'll see you on the other side.' As the lethal drug began taking effect, Garza uttered: 'Here it comes!' His voice rose as he said 'Goodbye,' and then he let out a howl that was cut short within seconds as he took three deep breaths, then a couple of shallow ones.\u00a0He was pronounced dead 26 minutes later at 6.40pm. Before his death, Garza was given the same food as the rest of the inmates in his unit for his final meal because Texas no longer allows special-order last meals, according toLast Suppers. He had a grilled pork chop, sweet potatoes, green beans, black beans, cornbread, and peach cake, with a choice of water, tea, or punch to drink. Garza, 35, already had a long criminal record at age 20 when he was stopped by Riojas, who was part of a team targeting property crimes at apartment complexes. Garza ran off and witnesses say that when Riojas caught up with him, the two struggled and Garza grabbed the officer's gun. Riojas, 37, was fatally shot in the head. Witnesses said Garza put Riojas's gun in his pants, cursed at the fallen officer, and ran away. Garza was apprehended a day later at his sister's apartment after an informant told detectives that someone had tried to sell him the officer's missing semi-automatic service weapon. In a statement to detectives, Garza blamed Riojas. 'I truly think this was the cop's fault,' he said. 'I don't see why he wanted to pull out his gun.' Garza said he initially ran because he feared the officer would discover he was wanted on outstanding warrants. 'I didn't want to go to jail,' he said. While being escorted to a holding cell after his arrest, court documents described Garza as cocky and smirking. Riojas (pictured), 37, was part of a team targeting property crimes at apartment complexes. Garza fled when he was stopped by Riojas, which led to a struggle and the police officer's death . He used obscenity-laced language to tell officers they were 'lucky I didn't get y'all... too.' The San Antonio Police Officers Association provided buses for officers to make the 200-mile-trip to Huntsville. Several dozen police officers were outside the prison Wednesday evening, and stood at attention and saluted as Riojas' sister - who also is with the San Antonio department and watched Garza die - and the officer-witnesses emerged. 'We want them to see we do care and the salute is a form of respect,' said Mike Helle, president of the association. But Helle, who was in the same police academy training class with Riojas, said the execution 'doesn't bring back my classmate and my friend.' Defense attorneys had said the shooting was accidental and Garza was a product of childhood neglect and abuse. In a 2013 failed appeal, attorney Michael Gross said Garza's family encouraged him to break the law. His criminal record began at age 14, and included burglaries, thefts, escape from custody and leading police on a stolen car chase. Texas carries out the death penalty more than any other state. Garza was the first inmate executed with a new supply of pentobarbital recently obtained by Texas Department of Criminal Justice officials that would allow his and two other lethal injections scheduled for this month to be carried out.

        "article": "The Taliban annual 'spring offensive' began today in Afghanistan with the jihadi group claiming responsibility for  108 attacks in the opening five hours. A US air base near Kabul and military outposts in Nuristan were targeted today as the militants continue to pursue territory in north east Afghanistan. According to the official spokesman for the Taliban, Zabiullah Mujahid, over 80 per cent of Afghanistan is currently 'controlled' by the Taliban. Whilst their figures are exaggerated, the Taliban's new offensive is set to the start of fresh violence in the troubled country. Taliban militants opened the offensive today with a failed rocket attack on a US base in Bagram air base, situated close to the Afghan capital city of Kabul. Taliban militants opened the offensive today with a failed rocket attack on a US base in Bagram air base, situated close to the Afghan capital city of Kabul. The rocket landed harmlessly in base and despite the Taliban claims that they had 'killed and wounded hundreds of Americans', no casualties have been reported. Improvised explosive devices (IEDs) were also reportedly detonated in Kunar and Khost province. Casualty numbers remain unconfirmed but the attacks symbolize a worrying indicator of the broad areas being targeted by the Taliban. The Taliban announced the launch of Operation Azm, meaning 'determination', on Wednesday, revealing fresh plans to target government buildings and Afghan security forces. The Taliban have been waging an jihadi insurgency since they were forced out of power in late 2001. With the emergence of ISIS, the Taliban are already facing a struggle for power in Afghanistan. The extremists want to turn Afghanistan into an Islamic Emirate, governed by strict sharia law. In December, photos emerged of a robber being publicly executed by Taliban fighters with machine guns. The Taliban announced the launch of Operation Azm, meaning 'determination', on Wednesday, revealing fresh plans to target government buildings and Afghan security forces in what is expected to be the bloodiest fighting season in a decade. With NATO forces pulling back from the frontlines, concerns remain whether trained Afghan forces will be able to consistently repel the expected barrage of Taliban attacks. 'The Islamic Emirate is going to launch the spring operations under the inspirational name of 'Azm' (Determination) at 5 am on 24th April 2015,' the Taliban said in a statement on Wednesday, using their official name. 'The main targets of these operations... will be the foreign occupiers, especially their permanent military bases... officials of the stooge regime, their military constellations, especially their intelligence, interior ministry and defence ministry officials.' Former Afghan Taliban fighters are seen holding weapons before they hand them over, as part of a government peace and reconciliation initiative, at a ceremony in Jalalabad recently. NATO's combat mission formally ended in December but a small follow-up foreign force has stayed on to train and support local security personnel. US President Barack Obama last month backpedaled on plans to shrink the US force in Afghanistan this year by nearly half, agreeing to keep the current level of 9,800 US troops until the end of 2015. The Taliban, who have waged a deadly insurgency since they were ousted from power in late 2001, said the announcement would damage any prospect of peace talks as they vowed to continue fighting. Aside from the Taliban, the Afghan government has also repeatedly warned of the Islamic State (IS) group making inroads into the country. President Ashraf Ghani blamed IS for a suicide attack last Saturday in the eastern city of Jalalabad that killed 33 people and wounded more than 100 others. If verified, that would mark the first major attack by the jihadists in the country. President Ashraf Ghani blamed IS for a suicide attack last Saturday in the eastern city of Jalalabad that killed 33 people and wounded more than 100 others. Afghan security forces are struggling to cope with the new offensive across Afghanistan \u00a0particularly with the gradual withdrawal of NATO forces . The upsurge in attacks has taken a heavy toll on ordinary Afghans. According to the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), the number of civilians killed and wounded up by 22 percent in 2014 compared to the previous year. In the first three months of 2015, civilian casualties from ground fighting were up eight percent on the same period last year, a new UNAMA report said. But in their statement, the Taliban said their 'top priority will be given to safeguard and protect the lives and properties of the civilian people' during the offensive.

        "article": "Charlie Adam looked up, noticed Thibaut Courtois was off his line, and thought: \u2018Why not?\u2019 Why not, indeed. The Stoke City midfielder was 66 yards from goal but had the audacity to score what will surely be crowned the Barclays Premier League\u2019s strike of the season. David Beckham did it against Wimbledon in August 1996, as did Wayne Rooney against West Ham last March. There was Xabi Alonso in 2006 and Maynor Figueroa three years later, too. Charlie Adam (centre) lets fly from inside his own half as he scores one of the goals of his career at Chelsea . Thibaut Courtois watches on as he is unable to stop Adam's shot from hitting the back of the net for 1-1 . Yet this was different. It was not a hit and hope. It was not a lob. This was a direct shot from deep inside Adam\u2019s own half which fooled one of the world\u2019s greatest goalkeepers \u2014 and Adam meant it. Sportmail\u2019s Jamie Redknapp agreed. \u2018This is better than Beckham, more audacious than Rooney\u2019s last season, This is one of the best strikes we\u2019ve ever seen. It\u2019s an absolutely incredible piece of play by Charlie Adam. \u2018You categorise goals as great individual efforts or team goals, but that was a piece of genius. To even try it is brilliant.\u2019 Even by the standards those at Stamford Bridge are used to seeing week in, week out, this was special. Particularly because it came from an unexpected source, from a \u2018bloke who looks like a bus driver\u2019, as former English cricket captain Freddie Flintoff colourfully put it. Nineteen years ago, when Beckham introduced himself to the world with his goal from the halfway line, he did so wearing the wrong footwear. The Manchester United great beat Wimbledon goalkeeper Neil Sullivan wearing custom-made boots embroidered with \u2018Charlie\u2019 on the tongue \u2014 adidas sending Beckham a pair which were actually intended for Rangers attacking midfielder Charlie Miller. Adam (second left) admitted he had mixed emotions after scoring the goal but losing the game . David Beckham struck from inside his own half for Manchester United against Wimbledon in 1996 . Beckham celebrated the final goal in 3-0 win for United on the opening day of the 1996-97 season . Chelsea became the second team to score 100 penalties in the Premier League. Liverpool were the first and have now scored 102. Miller never got his boots as they were retired, turned into a museum piece, having helped Beckham towards his first of 115 England caps less than three weeks later against Moldova. From one Scottish Charlie to another, Adam plans to frame his boots and shirt from Stamford Bridge, but this goal is unlikely to be the making of the former Rangers, Blackpool and Liverpool midfielder as it was for Beckham. Yet in the four seconds it took for the ball to go from boot to net, Adam disproved the theory that sequels are never better than the original. \u2018The manager kept saying to me, \u201ccome in the middle of the pitch\u201d, to try to get on the ball,\u2019 Adam said. \u2018I\u2019m not a winger, I\u2019m not a wide left midfielder, I don\u2019t have the pace to go in behind so I\u2019ve seen an opening, I\u2019ve seen the goalie off his line and I thought, \u201cwhy not do it at a place like Chelsea?\u201d 'I\u2019ve seen the goalie back-pedalling and I was praying it would go in. I\u2019ll remember it for the rest of my career.\u2019 From Spain\u2019s Marca to Italy\u2019s La Gazzetta dello Sport, the goal has been admired worldwide. One man who does not want to see it again, however, is Jose Mourinho. It left a black mark against a win which moved them seven points clear at the top of the Premier League, yet even the Chelsea manager can admire a wonder-goal when one comes along, as much as it hurts to admit it. Even Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho had to admit that Adam's goal was a strike of the highest quality . Adam (right) celebrates with his Stoke City team-mates after scoring at Stamford Bridge on Saturday . \u2018It was a fantastic goal, every player in the world would like to score a goal like that,\u2019 Mourinho said. \u2018Diego Maradona to Lionel Messi to all these brilliant players. Not all of them did score that goal in their careers.\u2019 Maradona, Messi, and Adam. Unlike the Argentinian greats, he is known more for his heavy tackling, as Gareth Bale found out when he suffered ankle ligament damage in May 2011. Yet this was straight from the Pele playbook. Stoke had not managed a single shot on target with half-time minutes away and there seemed no danger as Adam picked up the ball 10 yards inside his own half. Courtois mistakenly thought the same. Yet this is nothing new from Adam. He did it for Blackpool reserves previously, and Ross County, too. Asked if it is something he thinks about using regularly during a game, Adam said: \u2018Every time.\u2019 Midway through this interview, Chelsea striker Didier Drogba interrupts. \u2018Why?\u2019 he asks Adam in mock indignation. \u2018Tell me why?\u2019 To which Adam replies: \u2018I watch your videos.\u2019 Indeed there are compilations of goals just as outrageous on YouTube and, on Saturday, Adam rightly earned his place in history among them.",

        "article": "An undergraduate student at Duke University has admitted to hanging a noose in a tree and is no longer on campus, university officials said Thursday. At a news conference Thursday afternoon, school spokesman Michael Schoenfeld said the school would not release the name of the student who admitted to hanging the noose, found early Wednesday in a plaza area at the heart of the campus. The student was identified with information provided by other students and will be subject to Duke's student conduct process and that an investigation is continuing to find out if others were involved, Schoenfeld said. Identified: Officials at Duke University say they have caught the student culprit responsible for hanging a noose from a tree on campus this week . Taking a stand: The noose sparked a mass protest on campus on Wednesday. The noose is a particularly sensitive image in the state, where black residents were once terrorized by lynchings . Schoenfeld said the school believes federal education laws protecting information about students and their grades prevent the school from describing his or her gender, race or whether the student had been in trouble in the past. The school also is working with state and federal officials about potential criminal violations. Officials say the noose was found about 2am Wednesday in the plaza outside the Bryan Center, the student commons building. Black Student Alliance vice president Henry Washington said he and about 14 other students saw the noose hanging overnight after being alerted via Twitter. On Thursday, he praised the reaction of fellow students and administrators at the school. 'I appreciate that immediate action was taken both by the student community to identify a person and by the faculty to ensure that disciplinary action is taken,' he said. Unknown: The university is not identifying the student in question, citing federal education laws protecting student privacy. Above, a view of the Durham, North Carolina campus . Duke Student Affairs Vice President Larry Moneta said the student would face judgment under the school's code of conduct, which includes penalties ranging from probation to expulsion. He said it was 'too soon to make any comment' about whether the student had expressed remorse for the noose episode. 'This is all part of what the investigation will yield and the opportunity for the student to speak to the basis for the behavior,' Moneta said. At a gathering Wednesday in front of the university's Gothic chapel building, Duke President Richard Brodhead told a crowd of several thousand that their presence was a rejection of what the noose symbolizes in a region where lynchings were once used to terrorize black residents. And he said that while administrators and campus police investigate who displayed the noose and why, it is up to each individual to reject racism. 'One person put up that noose, but this is the multitude of people who got together to say that's not the Duke we want,' he told the crowd. 'That's not the Duke we're here for, and that's not the Duke we're here to create.'",

        "article": "The family of a man shot dead by a reserve deputy who confused his weapon for his Taser has slammed the gunman's decision to take a month-long vacation to the Bahamas while out on bond. Robert Bates, 73, appeared in Tulsa district court on Tuesday and pleaded not guilty to second-degree manslaughter in the death of Eric Harris, who was killed during a botched sting on April 2. Despite the charges, the judge said that the retired insurance executive, who is out on $25,000 bond, is allowed to take a previously\u00a0planned vacation to the Bahamas,\u00a0NBC reported. Harris' family reacted to the decision in a statement released by their lawyer. Heading to court: Robert Bates, left, is seen walking to court on Tuesday morning with his attorney Corbin Brewster, right, before he entered his not-guilty plea in the death of Eric Harris earlier this month . 'Mistake': The 73-year-old reserve deputy claims he mistakenly pulled out his gun instead of his Taser and shot dead the man as he fled the scene of an undercover operation on April 2 . 'Whether intended or not, Mr. Bates' vacationing in the Bahamas at this time sends a message of apathy with respect to the shooting and Eric's life,' they said. 'At a time when we are still mourning the death of a loved one that he shot down in the street, Mr. Bates will be relaxing and enjoying his wealth and privilege.' It is not clear when he is leaving for the holiday but Bates will next appear in court on July 2. Bates has previously visited the Bahamas with the sheriff, Stanley Glanz, and another reserve deputy and paid for part of Glanz's trip. Bates, a Tulsa County volunteer, shot Harris, 44, after the man was confronted during an undercover gun-sale operation and ran past him. Video of the incident shows Bates chasing after Harris. In an attempt to subdue him, Bates went to grab his Taser, but was unaware he had actually pulled out his gun instead. In the video, which was released by the sheriff's office, Bates can be heard shouting 'Taser! Taser!' When the gunshot goes off, he says: 'I shot him! I'm sorry.' The fatally-wounded man can be heard saying: 'Oh my god, he shot me! He shot me! He shot me, man' before adding: 'Oh, my god. I'm losing my breath!' In separate news conferences on Monday, the county sheriff and lawyers for Harris' family disagreed on whether the reserve officer should have been allowed to conduct police work. Sheriff Stanley Glanz said Bates, his longtime insurance agent and former campaign manager, had been properly trained and passed annual firearms certifications required by the state. Charged: Bates (left in his mug shot) shot Harris (pictured right) and faces four years in prison if convicted . Shooting: This photo shows a deputy bending down to pick up Bates's dropped gun following the accidental shooting in Tulsa earlier this month. Harris is being held down on the ground, out of shot, by other deputies . Terrified: The fatally-wounded man, who is being held by his neck and back by the deputies (pictured), says: 'Oh my god, he shot me! He shot me! He shot me, man.' He then adds: 'Oh, my god. I'm losing my breath' Dan Smolen, a lawyer for Harris' family, said the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office violated a number of its internal policies by letting Bates carry his personal handgun after training with another weapon. Smolen also said the department failed to keep a permanent record of Bates' training, in violation of local policies. Records Bates released during the weekend showed that the volunteer officer was trained on a .45, not the weapon used in Harris' death. Bates, who sold his insurance business for $6 million in 1999, was trained to be a Tulsa Police Department patrolman in 1964 but left in 1965. He was out of law enforcement for 35 years, returning for volunteer work in Florida in 2000 before joining the Tulsa County force in 2008 and making a number of donations to the agency. He also was Glanz' campaign manager during the 2012 election. During an appearance on the Today show last week, he apologized to Harris' family. Anger: Harris' son Aidan Fraley (pictured right with his uncle Andre Harris a week after his father's death), has said  the  police officers who allowed Bates to become a cop should be held accountable for his death . Confusion: An image shows a Taser and a handgun similar to the weapons Bates was carrying. He mistakenly thought he was holding a Taser, not his handgun, when he fatally shot Eric Harris . 'First and foremost let me apologize to the family of Eric Harris,' he said. 'I rate this as number one on my list of things in my life that I regret... I still can't believe it happened.' He also insisted that, despite keeping his gun and Taser on different parts of his uniform, it was easy to confuse the two. 'This has happened a number of times around the country, I have read about it in the past,' Bates said.\u00a0'I thought to myself after reading several cases, 'I don't understand how this can happen'. You must believe me - it can happen to anyone.' Harris' son responded by saying that the volunteer deputy was too old to be on the police force. 'He should have been in a retirement home, not out there on the scene killing my dad,' Aidan Fraley said, NBC reported.",

Earlier in the day, a young barrista named Jaleel working at a Starbucks coffeehouse on 8th Street in Manhattan told Daily Mail their system went down at around 7.30pm. The computer glitch prevented staff from accepting credit cards or ringing up sales, but Starbucks workers at the East Village location were still accepting cash. Some people who were standing in line at around 8.30pm had their wallets in hand. At one point, Jaleel walked up to a middle-age man waiting to get his coffee and let him know that their system was down and they were unable to take credit cards. In response, the customer flashed several folded banknotes. Starbucks released a statement on its website saying the company is aware of the point-of-sale register outage in the US and Canada.

        "article": "Supernan: Eileen Mason, 92, saved her friend from a would-be robber by ramming him with her scooter . A 92-year-old great-grandmother has told of how she saved her 75-year-old friend from a mugger - by ramming him with her mobility scooter. Eileen Mason and Margaret Seabrook had been to a lunch club meeting in Swindon, Wiltshire, when an 'evil looking' man suddenly appeared from behind a fence. According to the two pensioners, the man initially attempted to get his hands on the contents of Mrs Seabrook's scooter basket, before grabbing Mrs Mason by the arm and reaching for her carrier bag. However, the would-be robber was soon to regret his action, as Mrs Mason shouted 'Oh, no you don't,' and slammed on the accelerator of her scooter. The attacker was knocked to the ground, and the motorised pair sped off into the distance. Speaking after the robbery attempt, the great-grandmothers said they refused to let the 'weasel' bring them down. Mrs Mason said she had seen the young man's intention to take the contents of Mrs Seabrook's basket, before turning on her in an attempt to steal a brand new pair of trousers from her bag. The sprightly 92-year-old says the next few moments were 'a bit of a blur' and that all she remembers is accelerating her scooter and knocking the man to the ground. Mrs Mason, who has four children, ten grandchildren and 13 great-grandchildren, said: 'I saw him look into my basket and I said; 'Oh no you don't!', really loudly. 'I put my scooter into accelerate and turned really fast. The next thing I know he was on the floor. I thought 'my gosh'. 'I had slowed up because it looked like something was going to happen. He just looked evil, with dark, piercing eyes. 'He came from over my shoulder, caught my arm and pulled me back. 'When he came round the second time, I slammed down on the speed so the scooter went up on to the grass, and when the back end came round it knocked him down. 'He lay there for a moment and then made a quick exit. I have never seen him round here before, and I felt a bit panicky because we did not like the look of him. Heroic ladies: Mrs Mason and her friend Margaret Seabrook, 75, had been to a lunch club meeting in Swindon, Wiltshire, when an 'evil looking' man tried to rob them of the contents of their mobility scooter baskets . 'You just don't think this would happen to you on your way home from lunch club. 'We always go together, and It's a good thing we did, otherwise it would have been much easier for him. 'I might be old but I'm still quick. I think the way I shouted probably frightened him. 'The next day I was very shaken. We were lucky, because he could have hit us - if he had been able to catch us.' Mrs Seabrook, a mother-of-three, who has eight grandchildren and four great-grandchildren, added: 'We came around the corner and he was just stood there by the fence. 'He didn't look right. He had a white baseball cap on his head back to front, which isn't the right way to wear it, and black eyes. 'I heard Eileen shout so I swung around and all I saw was him on the floor. I didn't see his face after that because he ran away so fast. 'If he had got my bag he would have got everything, because all my bank cards were in my purse. We were both very shaken up by it, but we can laugh about it now. Shocking scenes: Mrs Mason shouted 'oh no, you don't' and ran over the unidentified attacker, after which he made a swift exit, leaving the two great-grandmothers to speed off on their scooters .

'I don't think it'll happen again now either, I certainly hope not. They were obviously targeting us because they thought we'd be an easy target - he was wrong. 'After, I took Eileen back to my flat, called the police, and made a cup of tea to calm.' Eileen added: 'Everyone on Facebook has been going crazy - I can't believe it. Everyone has been so supportive of us. We just can't believe it all really.' 'We go to the lunch club every week on our scooters and nothing like this has ever happened before. 'We went through the war and all the bombings. We won't let a weasel like that hold us back. 'I would stand up for myself again if I needed to, but hopefully I won't need to. We will carry on as normal though, he hasn't put us off.' Wiltshire Police are appealing for any witnesses to the incident, which took place at 1.15pm, to contact them on 101.",

        "article": "Jamelia has today responded to the furious backlash she is facing after saying that obese women 'should feel uncomfortable' about their unhealthy size, and that high street stores should not be catering for them. The Loose Women panellist said she was 'hounded on Twitter' after airing her views on the ITV show in a discussion about overweight teenagers, and now insists she was only referring to people larger than a size 20. 'Of course I don't think we should ban plus-size clothes from shops,' the 34-year-old mother-of-two said on Loose Women this afternoon. 'I was referring to extreme sizing, I was referring to health and how we should all participate in helping our youngsters to live healthier lifestyles.' Scroll down for video . The Loose Women panellist said she was 'hounded on Twitter' after airing her views on the ITV show in a discussion about overweight teenagers, and now insists she was only referring to people larger than a size 20 . Jamelia admitted she had found the anger directed towards her following her comments 'really difficult.' She said: 'Some of the things that have been printed I have actually said but not in that context... It's difficult to say your piece or to speak honestly when it kind of gets misconstrued in that way.' Jamelia's co-panellists were quick to leap to her defence. Ruth Langsford, 55, stated: 'I definitely, categorically said we're not talking about size 14, 16 or even 18.' Janet Street Porter, 68, then said: 'I was completely in agreement with Jamelia and I said you've got to ask yourself if a young girl is already size 20-25, can she run around with her children, can she enjoy life or is she storing up health problems for later? 'So I do feel like Jamelia has been somewhat unfairly picked on.' 'Of course I don't think we should ban plus-size clothes from shops,' the 34-year-old mother-of-two said on Loose Women this afternoon (pictured). 'I was referring to extreme sizing' Jamelia's co-panellists, Ruth Langford (left), Coleen Nolan (center left) and Janet Street Porter (right) were quick to leap to her defence . Earlier today, Jamelia appeared on Good Morning Britain to say that she was sorry for upsetting people. 'I didn\u2019t make it clear on the show that I was talking about extremes, I was talking about above size 20 and below size six, those sizes being available en masse,' she said. 'Knowing that I offended people really upset me. Knowing that I made people question themselves and their choices, it really did upset me. All I can do is apologise for that.' But the star added: 'I do stand by what I said. I\u2019m a real woman with real opinions. I get paid to voice my opinions. Social media users weighed in on Twitter, telling Jamelia to 'keep it shut' and accusing the singer of 'stirring up hatred' on the topic . Appearing on Good Morning Britain earlier today, Jamelia,  pictured with GMB presenters Kate Garraway and Susanna Reid, said she still stood by her remarks . Jamelia said of the reaction: 'It\u2019s been absolutely awful but this is my job. I believe we are all entitled to our opinion. 'I genuinely love people and believe everyone has the right to feel wonderful and feel beautiful and it was never my intention to make people feel any less than what they are.' Speaking on Loose Women yesterday, in the conversation which sparked the controversy, Jamelia said: 'I do not think it's right to facilitate people living an unhealthy lifestyle, in the same way I don't believe that a size zero should be available - it's not a healthy size for an average woman to be.' The star also argued that clothing shouldn't be sold in a size zero either, because that too is 'unhealthy' Jamelia first response to yesterday's Twitter backlash was a quote (pictured) Jamelia, who also claimed she was 'all for celebrating people as they are', added: 'I don't believe they [high street stores] should be providing clothes for below that range or above that range. 'Yes, have specialist shops, but you should feel uncomfortable if you are unhealthy... to be available in every High Street store, I don't think that's right.' Viewers were were enraged by her comments and vented on Twitter, with many declaring she should be 'sacked' from the show, and not a single user taking her side. 'I'm so disappointed with Jamelia's comments on Loose Women today. WE. ARE. NOT. PROMOTING. UNHEALTHY.LIFESTYLES. #PlusSizeDebate,' wrote one. On Monday, Jamelia showed her support for a new Good Morning Britain campaign dubbed #SelfieEsteem, which asks people to snap a first-take selfie and share it unfiltered (pictured) Viewers were quick to criticise the former singer's comments on Twitter . One asked Jamelia directly what 'large girls' are supposed to wear, if not clothes . Other fans said they were 'disappointed' with the singer's comments . 'Ah Jamelia. The advocate for self esteem telling people that if you're over a certain size you shouldn't shop on the high street. Idiot,' argued another. Indeed, on Monday the singer showed her support for a new Good Morning Britain campaign dubbed #SelfieEsteem, by snapping a first-take selfie and sharing it on social media unfiltered. Jamelia responded to the Twitter backlash with a quote yesterday afternoon. 'Never waste your time trying to explain, to people committed to misunderstanding you,' she tweeted to her 34,000 followers. Jamelia, pictured in London last week, says she had found the anger directed towards her following her comments 'really difficult'",

        "article": "She's just days away from giving birth but, as ever, the Duchess of Cambridge refused to let her style icon status slip during her second pregnancy. Rather than  swaddling her growing bump  under baggy dresses, the 33-year-old dressed to impress every time she stepped out. But while Mulberry coats and Alexander McQueen gowns did creep in, much of Kate's pregnancy wardrobe came from the High Street. Scroll down for video . Favourites: Hobbs, Seraphine and ASOS have all been worn repeatedly during the pregancy . From a \u00a335 ASOS polka-dot dress to  Seraphine shifts, the Duchess is proof that you don't have to splash out to look gorgeous while expecting. Leading the High Street charge to the Duchess of Cambridge's wardrobe is Hobbs, a mid-range label that has taken her through everything from glamorous evening events to international tours. So enamoured is Kate of the brand, even Zara, of which she was once a die-hard fan, has had to make way for it, although another budget favourite, L.K Bennett, \u00a0also remains a favourite. 'The Duchess of Cambridge likes to play it quite safe when it comes to her wardrobe, pre and post-baby, and Hobbs is the perfect brand for her,' explains fashion pundit Simon Glazin. Hobbs: A \u00a3160 shirt dress (left) in January and, right, in a peplum top at a Place2Be event in November . 'Not only is it uber British, with everything designed in-house in London, it also dovetails with royal fashion protocol: not too revealing, neutral colours, and affordable.' The Duchess wore a brown shirt dress from Hobbs to visit foster carers in North London in January and a delicate polka dot velvet top by the brand for a Place2Be reception at Kensington Palace in November. On that occasion, she deployed one of her favourite styling tricks and combined the budget top with a glamorous silk skirt by Jenny Packham for maximum effect. But while she championed Hobbs on several occasions during her second pregnancy, it is by no means the only high street staple in Kate's wardrobe. Spot the Duchess! Kate in a \u00a3169 Hobbs Dalmatian coat in March that was first seen in 2013, right . The brunette royal is also a huge fan of a small Anglo-French label called S\u00e9raphine, which has grown from a small shop in 2002 to the A-list favourite it is today. The Duchess is the brand's most famous fan, having repeatedly chosen the label during both her pregnancies. Along with a \u00a3195 coat worn in January and a \u00a395 blue and green floral dress sported to visit the Potteries in February, she also opted for the brand when making her d\u00e9but in New York. On that occasion, it was the glamorous \u00a3225 plum boucle Marina coat that was chosen - and true to form, the design has since sold out repeatedly. S\u00e9raphine is the brainchild of French expat Cecile Reinaud, who launched the brand in 2002 from a small shop on High Street Kensington, and is no doubt thrilled with the royal endorsement. In March, on a visit to ITV drama Downton Abbey, Kate wore a chic cream coat from high street maternity label, JoJo Maman B\u00e9b\u00e9. She has also sported a shirt dress from Jaeger and \u00a399 print dress by Alice Temperley during her pregnancy. Cosy: Kate in a \u00a3275 Seraphine Maternity Marina coat with Prince William in New York in December last year . S\u00e9raphine: Kate in a \u00a3195 coat in January and, right, wearing a \u00a359 Vanessa dress in December . Thanks to the much-marked Kate effect, everything she has worn has swiftly sold out. 'One of the reasons for her enduring sartorial popularity is the accessibility of her wardrobe,' explains Glazin. 'It's very real. Very practical. People can relate to her through her wardrobe, which is a clever move from her and her people. 'Nothing is out of reach, and she does wear a lot from the British High Street, which is great to see. It allows people to copy her head-to-toe. People want her hair, her make-up and now her wardrobe. 'People want someone to look up to when it comes to the royals. She is the new generation. 'She, more than any other royal, has made fashion achievable for the public. Diana had an amazing wardrobe but she wore a lot of made-to-measure pieces. 'She's quite safe with her wardrobe, which makes it even more accessible.' Good look: Kate wore a \u00a3250 blue Jaegar tile-print shirt dress in a video message supporting mental health .

Stoll, 32, is the longtime boyfriend of Dancing With The Stars host Erin Andrews, a former ESPN employee who now works as an NFL sideline reporter for Fox Sports. The NHL player was arrested for possession of cocaine and MDMA, also known as Molly, at the Wet Republic pool at the MGM Grand Hotel shortly before 5pm. On Monday TMZ Sports added that the athlete was trying to smuggle over three grams of cocaine and over eight grams of MDMA by hiding them in his board shorts. Scroll down for video . Jarret\u00a0Stoll, 32 (left), is the longtime boyfriend of Dancing With The Stars host Erin Andrews, 36 (right) He looked bright-eyed and alert in a mugshot taken Friday evening in Las Vegas . Stoll (seen partying at the MGM Grand in 2014 after the Kings Stanley Cup win) was arrested on Friday in Las Vegas, Nevada, on drug possession charges . He was arrested for possession of cocaine at the Wet Republic pool at the MGM Grand (above) Stoll was previously in the news for non-sports related reasons back in 2013 when he was rushed to the hospital after having a seizure at his home in Hermosa Beach, California during the offseason, with the Kings later saying they did not know what caused the incident. Stoll, who will make a cameo in the upcoming film version of the popular HBO show Entourage, was booked into the Clark County Detention Center and was listed as having a hearing on Saturday after posting $5,000 bail. The charges include possession of Class 1, 2, 3 and 4 controlled substances, including cocaine and ecstasy. Michael Pariente, a Las Vegas criminal defense lawyer, says that Stoll will likely be offered a plea deal as a first time offender. Speaking with TSN, he said; 'It's pretty much a slap on the wrist. Even if he was going to represent himself they'd make him an offer like this.' This would include a $1,000 fee, an online drug awareness course, and possibly community service. Stoll was likely at the MGM Grand to attend the\u00a0two year anniversary of their popular club Hakkasan Friday evening, an event that featured Tiesto and brought out Christina Aguilera. In both 2012 and 2014, Stoll headed to the MGM Grand to celebrate  the end of the hockey season with his Kings teammates. It seems that Stoll went on a date with Andrews on Thursday night, as she posted a photo of a romantic-looking candle that was seemingly taken at Italian restaurant La Sosta Enoteca in Manhattan Beach, California, on her Instagram page, and a fan snapped a photo with Stoll earlier in the day in the same neighborhood. The caption, which did not mention Stoll by name, read: 'Always a great date night'. Andrews posted a photo of a candle that was seemingly taken at Italian restaurant La Sosta Enoteca in Manhattan Beach, California, on her Instagram page on Thursday. That location is four hours from Vegas . Andrews sparked engagement rumors after she posted an Instagram of her wearing a large ring in March . A fan snapped this photo with Stoll on Thursday in California . Stoll had 17 points in 73 games this season and was a member of the Kings' Stanley Cup championship teams in 2012 and 2014. He has been with the team since 2008, but will become an unrestricted free agent on July 1. The Kings failed to qualify for postseason play after winning the Stanley Cup last year and in 2012. The team said in a statement following Stoll's arrest: 'We are aware of police reports out of Clark County, Nevada regarding Jarret Stoll. 'Our organization is concerned and has begun conducting a thorough internal investigation. 'While we continue to actively gather facts, we are withholding further comment at this time.' Veteran had 17 points in 73 games this season and was a member of the Kings' recent Stanley Cup teams . Andrews, 36, sparked engagement rumors after she posted an Instagram of her wearing a very large, square-cut diamond ring last month. Fans thought the picture meant Stoll had proposed, but Andrews said the ring was on loan. 'I've definitely dropped hints here and there,' the Fox broadcaster shared with\u00a0ABC News\u00a0in July. 'But we haven't looked at rings... Nothing there yet, the ball's in his court.' She added: 'But no we are fine! We've had enough on our plate for the last two years of dating and haven't really gone there yet.' He was previously engaged to actress and model Rachel Hunter, the former wife of singer Rod Stewart, and dated actress Katie Cassidy. Stoll broke off his\u00a0engagement with Hunter just seven weeks before they were supposed to be married.",

Peter Kelly, a 34-year-old volunteer high school wrestling coach, was stabbed in the chest beside the St Croix River at 9.45pm on Tuesday as he fished with a friend. The two men were on the Minnesota side of the river when they heard three men being loud and rude on the Wisconsin side and asked them to quieten down, authorities said. For the next three hours, Kelly and his friend exchanged heated words with the three other anglers. Scroll down for video . Loss: Peter Kelly, 34, was stabbed in the chest after he and a friend asked a group of rowdy fishermen to be quiet at a river on Tuesday. The argument escalated and Kelly was attacked and died at the scene . 'The group on the Minnesota side was making statements like, 'Why don't you clean up your act',' . Captain Steve Smith with the Polk County Sheriff's Office in Wisconsin told CBS Minnesota. 'The challenge was made \u2013 'why don't you come over here?''

They were traveling in two vehicles with Minnesota license plates: a blue Chevrolet S-10 pickup truck and a small passenger car. Left behind: Kelly and his wife Christie, pictured, have four sons and a daughter all under the age of nine . Authorities are also asking for help tracking down five people who were in the area at about 7.30pm as they have witnessed the argument that ultimately escalated. Now his small community in St Croix Falls, which has just 2,100 people, is mourning the loss of the family man who volunteered as a coach at the high school's football, baseball and wrestling teams. He would often go to work at 4am so he could get back in time to coach before dinner, fellow high school coach Dan Clark told the Star Tribune. His day job was at Andersen Windows in Bayport, where he worked in quality control. 'He worked 10 to 12 hours a day at Andersen Windows, and he would come home and volunteer four hours a night to our wrestling program for four or five months a year,' Clark toldFox9. 'He was one of the greatest human beings that I ever hoped to meet.' His wife, Christie, stayed at home to care for their children, who are all under nine. They have four boys, Kellen, Payton, Miles and August, and last year welcomed a baby girl, Molly. Devastated: His brother, Mike Kelly, said the man's children did not understand what had happened . Confrontation: Kelly and a friend were on the Minnesota side of the St Croix River, pictured, and told men on the Wisconsin side to stop making so much noise. Kelly was stabbed at Interstate Park . 'I don't think they fully understand the implications of what happened,' his brother, Mike Kelly, told KARE. 'His daughter will never even get to know him.' Friends and family added that they do not believe Kelly was to blame for the confrontation. 'He did good things, and did what was right all the time,' his brother added. 'And that's probably what cost him. Some knuckle heads swearing and being silly.' Anyone with information about the incident is asked to call the Sheriff's Office at 715-485-8300. A GoFundMe page has also been set up for the family.",

        "article": "The mother of a primary school pupil who told a Labour MP he supported Ukip because he wanted to get 'all the foreigners out the country' has admitted she's embarrassed by the exchange. Tristram Hunt, the shadow education secretary, was visiting the primary school in Derby where he was filmed asking the year six pupil who he would vote for in next month's election if he could. Video of the conversation shows the Labour MP was stunned by the statement, which a  Ukip spokesman claimed shows the schoolboy had been 'drinking in propaganda' from the party's rivals. The mother of the 10-year-old has said she has now sat down her son and explained 'it isn't about being foreign'.\u00a0But she added: 'I do personally support an Australian points system.' Scroll down for video . Tristram Hunt, the shadow education secretary, had asked the youngster who he would vote for in next month's election if he could take part . The mother, who wished to remain anonymous, told MailOnline she was 'embarrassed' after the video went viral online.\u00a0She added: 'I can see the funny side, but it is a but embarrassing. 'I don't really think my son understands the impact of what he said. I think he's just heard people talking. 'His dad agrees with some of UKIP's policies, but I haven't decided who I am going to vote for yet. 'When my son told me what he'd said, I sat him down and explained it isn't about being foreign. But I do personally support an Australian points system - if you have something to offer the country when you are coming in that's fair enough.' Mr Hunt, who was visiting a primary school in Derbyshire as part of the election campaign, asked the year six child: 'Do you know who you would vote for?' When the child said Ukip, Mr Hunt replied, 'Very good' and asked why. The youngster replied: 'To get all the foreigners out the country.' A Labour spokesman admitted to MailOnline that Mr Hunt had been taken aback by the schoolboy's remarks. He said: 'We at a school in Derbyshire, in a classroom. I'll admit we were a little bit surprised by the remark.' A Labour shadow minister was left gobsmacked after a primary school pupil told him he supported Ukip \u2013 because he wanted to get 'all the foreigners out the country' Mr Hunt appeared taken aback by the child's support for Ukip to get all the foreigners out the country . The exchange at Howitt Primary School at Heanor, Derbyshire, was recorded by BBC East Midlands and broadcast last night. Today the headteacher said that the unnamed boy's comments were 'not representative of the school'. The school has more than 400 pupils aged three to 11 and spent the last two years in special measures until January this year. Its latest Ofsted report says: 'Most pupils come from White British backgrounds. There are very few pupils from other heritage groups or who speak English as an additional language'. In the town of Heanor, which is 10 miles north of Derby, 98.2 per cent of the population is white. Nigel Farage yesterday insisted Ukip was not anti-immigration . In 2006 a Channel 5 documentary dubbed the town the 'skinhead capital of Britain' when the BNP came second in a council by-election and a government advisor said later that it was one of a few 'unhealthily all white' towns in the UK. The remarks come just 24 hours after Ukip claimed it was not an anti-immigrant party. A Ukip spokesman today claimed the boy had been brainwashed by the media. He said: 'Sadly I suspect the child has been drinking in all the propaganda. This is the information that people are continually being told, but it's not true. 'I thought it was rather sad that he thinks that is what Ukip is for. But it is not a surprise because that is how we are portrayed in the media.' The party's manifesto chief Suzanne Evans cast doubt on the party's promise to ban unskilled workers for five years before telling supporters that Ukip was not anti-immigration. In remarks which risk angering supporters opposed to foreigners arriving in the UK, Mrs Evans said: 'Ukip is not anti-immigration. Immigrants are not the problem. It's our current immigration system that is the problem. 'We will not pull up the drawbridge, we will simply start to control who walks over it.' However the manifesto includes a pledge to limit net migration to 50,000 and introduce a total ban on unskilled migration for five years. Yesterday it emerged Ukip has abandoned hopes of winning dozens of seats at the General Election and is now targeting just ten. The party reduced the number of constituencies where it is concentrating resources as it loses ground in the polls. A party strategist said 'something extraordinary' would now need to happen for it to win in places outside its target list. Since October, support for Ukip has tumbled from 19 to just 12 per cent as voters focus on the big choice between Labour and the Tories at the election.",

But not if you are on Nick Clegg's tour, where the Lib Dem leader has boarded his bright yellow 'fun bus' for a series of bizarre and unlikely photo\u00a0opportunities\u00a0which today saw him try his hand at ten-pin bowling. Aides say it is part of a\u00a0deliberate\u00a0strategy to get the Deputy Prime Minister out of London to meet normal people\u00a0as they go about their\u00a0daily\u00a0lives. And if that means pulling pints, sipping cocktails, hurtling down a zipwire or chatting to Joey Essex or a hedgehog with a brain injury, Mr Clegg seems only to happy to oblige. Scroll down for video . Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg appears determined to enjoy the election campaign, spending his Sunday afternoon ten-pin bowling . The visit to the bowling alley in Colchester, Essex delighted local people, and the press pack who have complained that the campaign so far has been boring . Aides say it is part of a deliberate strategy to get the Deputy Prime Minister out of London to meet normal people as they go about their daily lives . The Lib Dem leader is touring the country in a bright yellow election battlebus fitted out with a radio studio to allow him to continue his regular broadcasts designed to drum up support before May 7. While strategists admit they struggle to compete in the 'air war' as Labour and the Tories dominate the TV and radio bulletins, they\u00a0believe\u00a0Mr Clegg's enthusiasm for getting out and meeting people is paying off. On the first day of the election campaign, he rushed from a meeting with the Queen at Buckingham Palace to a wildlife sanctuary in Solihull. There he was introduced to Humpty, a hedgehog with a head injury which means he keeps walking round in circles. Mr Clegg was told the animals have a lifespan of just five years, which he might be able to relate to as his party faces the prospect of being booted out of government for the first time since 2010. Nick Clegg and Lib Dem candidate Lorely Burt were introduced to Humpty, a hedgehog with a head injury which means he keeps walking round in circles . He took a short break from campaigning to take part in Go Ape Haldon Forest Park near Exeter on Wednesday . The Deputy Prime Minister tested the water, but declined to take a dip, during a visit to Bath Spa on April 6 . Mr Clegg faced a grilling from TOWIE star Joey Essex, who seemed a little confused about the Liberal Democrats\u2019 name . Since then he has flown down a zipwire at a Go Ape park, tested the water at Bath Spa, planted flowers in\u00a0Newtown, painted a picture at a nursery in\u00a0Sheffield and watched racing wheels coming off the production in Chippenham. Food and drink has played a big part in the campaign too, from pulling pints in a Bath pub, to sipping cocktails in the sun in Southampton. He was even presented with cakes with his own face printed on them during a visit to the marginal seat of Poole and Mid Dorset. After launching the party's NHS manifesto, he was grilled by TOWIE star Joey Essex, who seemed a little confused about the Liberal Democrats\u2019 name. Mr Clegg had to patiently explain that the party was not called \u2018Demo-cats\u2019, after Essex wondered why it had such a \u2018weird\u2019 name.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019ve been Deputy Prime Minister for the last five years,\u2019 Mr Clegg added. \u2018That\u2019s sick. I sort of rule Essex. I was going to say, someone else will be Prime Minister next? Are you going to be Prime Minister?' The Lib Dem leader, currently on around 8 per cent in the polls, had to admit this was unlikely. But the pair parted amicable, but not before posing for a selfie. The Lib Dem leader is touring the country in a bright yellow election battlebus fitted out with a radio studio to allow him to continue his regular broadcasts designed to drum up support before May 7 . Food and drink has never been far from the campaign, including pulling pint at the Green Park brasserie in Bath, with Lib Dem candidate\u00a0Wera Hobhouse looking on . When Mr Clegg invited the ITV cameras into his home for a profile, he was seen glugging on white wine while wife Miriam spoke about the pressure of politics on family life . Mr Clegg has been seen drinking real lemonade in Holt, Wiltshire, a Banana Wharf Liberal Cocktail as he talks in Southampton and coffee in\u00a0Kingston and Surbiton . A cupcake featuring the faces of Mr Clegg and Vikki Slade, the Lib Dem candidate in Mid Dorset and North Poole . A source close to Mr Clegg said: 'Nick as a leader of a major political party has always tried to do things differently. This election campaign is no different. 'It's lively, it's fun. He is interacting with normal people, doing things that they do every day, whether it is ten-pint bowling or going down the pub. 'The key is to get out there and get him talking to people in their ordinary environment. 'We are lucky to have a leader in Nick who is up for doing anything. He is not afraid of a bacon sandwich.' Labour leader Ed Miliband, who famously struggled to eat a bacon sandwich for the cameras, has been criticised for appearing throughout the election campaign in front of a red Labour backdrop. It was all child's play as he tried his hand at painting at the Old School House Nursery School in Crosspool near Sheffield . He watered and tended some some plants during a visit to the mental health charity The Ponthafren Association, in Newtown . On a visit to Dymag, a specialist manufacturer of high performance racing wheels in Chippenham, Wiltshire there were inevitable jokes about the wheels coming off the Lib Dem campaign . Before setting off for an afternoon ten-pin bowling, Mr Clegg used a speech in London to warn Conservative plans to raise billions of pounds from the 'grubby hands of scroungers' will not work. The Lib Dem leader promised to 'spread the burden' of deficit reduction, with cuts to welfare and Whitehall budgets along with tax rises aimed at the very wealthy. Car tax would rise by \u00a325-a-year. But he scaled back his plans for a mansion tax, amid concern it could cost the party support in key seats in affluent parts of London. Mr Clegg set out plans for \u00a35billion in new tax rises, \u00a37billion raised from a crackdown on tax avoidance, \u00a312 billion in public spending reductions and a \u00a33 billion cut from welfare. But he mocked George Osborne's insistence that another \u00a312billion can be found from the welfare budget. Mr Clegg warned that it was 'quite simply impossible' to find savings on that scale without causing 'real pain to millions of families' and some of the most vulnerable people.",

        "article": "Sir Nick Faldo will now know for sure whether Rory McIlroy is bulking up too much after appearing to give the world No 1 a squeeze during Monday's practice round at Augusta National. After McIlroy was on the cover of Men's Health magazine and admitted he was 'obsessed with the gym', Faldo, a three-time Masters winner, voiced his concern that the 25-year-old was spending too much time on the weights. Faldo last week told the Daily Telegraph: 'Throwing 200lb and 300lb weights around is not going to be good for your golf swing. The heaviest weight I would ever lift was my body weight. You can play some pretty good golf when you have just got some decent shoulders on you and a strong neck and a strong pair of hands.' Sir Nick Faldo puts a hand on Rory McIlroy's shoulder during Monday's practice round ahead of the Masters . McIlroy and three-time Masters champion Faldo greeted each other with a handshake at Augusta National . McIlroy's fitness programme doesn't seem to be doing him too much harm. He goes into the year's first major as the bookies' favourite and looking to become just the sixth player in history to complete the career grand slam. He shook Faldo's hand on Monday and the Englishman, wearing a green jacket McIlroy would love to have in his collection, gave him a squeeze on the shoulder. As expected, McIlroy drew a huge crowd as patrons piled in to the famous Georgia course and Scottish amateur Bradley Neil had a taste of things to come as he practised with him. The patrons were also keen to get close to McIlroy as Masters week began with the Monday practice . McIlroy, preparing to tee off on the fourth, is bidding to win a fifth major and complete a career grand slam . World No 1 McIlroy made sure he put in a bit of work in the huge bunkers at the Georgia venue . Meanwhile, just 27 per cent of McIlroy's fellow professionals think he will complete the career grand slam by winning the Masters this week. But the good news for the 25-year-old is that he is far more popular than defending champion Bubba Watson, who cannot rely on too much support if he gets into a fight at Augusta National. Those were among the results gleaned by an ESPN.com survey of 103 tour professionals - 21 of whom were major champions - who anonymously answered questions on a wide range of topics. Asked if McIlroy would be wearing a green jacket on Sunday, 28 players said yes, 72 said no and three abstained. McIlroy will have caddie JP Fitzgerald on the bag to help him plot his way round the stunning course . The Northern Irishman had Scottish amateur Bradley Neil for company during Monday's practice . And McIlroy congratulated Neil after he chipped in at the second... save them for Thursday Bradley . Asked which player they would not help in a fight in the car park, Watson got double the number of responses (22.6 per cent) of second-place finisher Patrick Reed (11 per cent). Rory Sabbatini was third and Robert Allenby fourth. Other topics covered in the survey included slow play and recreational drugs - Kevin Na was judged in need of the first one-shot penalty in 20 years on the PGA Tour, narrowly ahead of Ben Crane, while 40 players felt the Tour should stop testing for marijuana. And on the subject of Tiger Woods, only seven per cent thought he would not win another major before the start of the season. However, after Woods missed the cut in Phoenix and withdrew from his next event after 11 holes, the numbers became 50/50. McIlroy walks with Scottish amateur Neil on the 12th fairway during a practice round for the Masters .

Katie Prager, 24, was diagnosed with an infection in her lungs in September 2009 and is desperately in need of a transplant as doctors predicted she would not live a year without new lungs. As her health continues to decline, her husband Dalton, 23, who has already received new lungs, is pleading for help. Her insurance company, Kentucky Medicaid, will not pay for the out-of-state treatment she needs at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, he says. Dalton pleaded: 'They are turning my wife into a number, a statistic, a dollar sign. I cannot lose her. This can\u2019t be the end of our love story. 'We are both ready to continue fighting but at this point we are running out of options and need your help. Please help me save my wife Katie.' Scroll down for video . Katie and Dalton Prager (above), who suffer from cystic fibrosis, followed their hearts and married as teens in 2011 . Katie, left, was diagnosed with an infection in her lungs called\u00a0Burkholderia Cepacia, and is desperately in need of a transplant as doctors predicted she would not live a year without new lungs . Dalton has already received new lungs, but Katie is waiting as Kentucky Medicaid will not pay for the out-of-state-treatment she needs at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center . For the couple who put everything on the line when they first met in person in 2009, her husband can not imagine losing the love of his life who he married four years ago. In December 2014, Katie was discharged from the Pittsburgh hospital after a long stay and returned to Kentucky, but began having trouble breathing three days later. The hospital would not admit her because Medicare would not pay because she had used her lifetime maximum, the couple says. She will not be covered for the expensive out-of-state medical procedure again until she spends 60 consecutive days out of the hospital. She was admitted into University of Kentucky Hospital, but it however, does not do transplants on patients with the kind of infection that Katie has. 'Sixty days out of the hospital is not an option for her anymore. Medicaid is also not an option as it will not cover her transplant due to UPMC being 'out of network',' Dalton wrote on the couple's YouCaring page. 'After explaining to Medicaid and Pittsburgh that there are only two places in the country, who would operate, due to (the bacteria) Cepacia, (UPMC and Duke Medical Center) still refused to work together to help her. 'She is struggling to attempt to negotiate her healthcare options from her hospital bed at the University of Kentucky.' Dalton said: 'They are turning my wife into a number, a statistic, a dollar sign. I cannot lose her. This can\u2019t be the end of our love story' Only three months away from their four-year anniversary, the couple has not been together since November 2014 when Dalton received new lungs, and hope they can be together to celebrate . Katie said that she feels like efforts to get transferred to Pittsburgh are at a standstill and that something needs to be done. 'It needs to happen soon. Nervous they aren't going to accept my case and that I'll have to restart this whole process at a completely different hospital,' she wrote on the couple's Facebook page. In February, Dr. Michael Anstead who is Katie's pulmonologist at the University of Kentucky, wrote a letter to Medicaid seeking for them to make an exception and pay for Katie's care in Pittsburgh, according to CNN. But Kentucky Medicaid denied the proposal saying UPMC declined to enroll as a Kentucky Medicaid provider. 'Medicaid policies allow for a simplified enrollment process for out-of-state providers in such situations,' Gwenda Bond, spokeswoman for the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services\u00a0wrote in a statement to CNN. 'Should UPMC reverse its decision and choose to enroll as a Kentucky Medicaid provider, the Department for Medicaid Services...will be happy to expedite their application.' However, the hospital claims that Medicaid told them if they wanted to treat Katie, they would be required to sign up hundreds of doctors to accept Kentucky Medicaid patients. 'UPMC wants to help Katie, and our physicians and staff have done everything possible to make that happen...It is up to Kentucky Medicaid to address this situation,' wrote\u00a0spokeswoman Wendy Zellner. So far, the couple relies on communication on phones and computers to keep in touch . UPMC said they are want to help Katie but said it is up to Kentucky Medicaid to address the situation . While Katie seems to be caught in limbo, the director of the media relations group at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said they are working to find a solution concerning her case by reaching out to the state agency. Only three months away from their four year anniversary in July, the couple have not been together since November 2014 when Dalton received his lung transplant at UPMC. Even though he also had Cepacia like Katie, which makes lung transplants more complicated, his has been a success. However, he has not been able to be near his wife in person until she receives a lung transplant because of the risk of infection. So far, they rely on communication through their phones or computers. But all they want is to be able to spend their anniversary together. 'I just want to make it to see our four year anniversary in July and be able to hold hands and just hug,' Katie told CNN. 'That's all I really want -- to be able to hug my husband on our fourth anniversary.' So far, the couple's YouCaring page has raised $43,425 in donations out of its goal of $50,000.",

In other tweets, the reporter mocked the 'these brave Anzacs' and accused Diggers of committing war crimes. 'Remembering the summary execution, widespread rape and theft committed by these 'brave' Anzacs in Egypt, Palestine and Japan,' he tweeted.

        "article": "Death: Gillian Nelson was 'delirious and spaced out' following the birth, according to her husband . A widower told an inquest today how his wife was \u2018delirious and spaced out\u2019 when she lost a large amount of blood after giving birth. James Ramirez, 37, said he has concerns over the care of his wife Gillian Nelson, 34, who died after complications arose with the birth of their son Wesley at a hospital in Bromley, Kent. He was called to the Princess Royal University Hospital at about 3.45am on January 28, 2014 after she had gone in to labour. She had given birth by the time he arrived at 4.25am. Asked about how he found his wife after birth, Mr Ramirez told London\u2019s Southwark Coroner\u2019s Court: \u2018I would say she was delirious, spaced out, obviously tired. She was pale. 'Somewhat reassuringly she had blood on her T-shirt which would suggest she had the chance to hold Wesley. She was babbling a little bit.\u2019 He stayed in the room with his wife until she was taken to theatre at about 6.30am. Mr Ramirez could recall there was \u2018a blur\u2019 of staff - but although he felt their manner was professional, there were \u2018no alarms going off\u2019. There had been blood loss and there were about nine people in the room, he said. The court was told that Miss Nelson, a businesswoman, had been admitted for an induced delivery at Princess Royal University Hospital, where she gave birth but was suffering bleeding. Baby: Wesley Ramierez (pictured), whose mother Miss Nelson died after complications arose with his birth . She had multiple cardiac arrests and was taken to theatre for a hysterectomy. Mr Ramirez told the court that it was only about 30 to 40 minutes after his wife left the room to go in to theatre that he realised how serious the situation had become. Evidence: James Ramirez (left), husband of Miss Nelson, leaves Southwark Coroner's Court today . He noted that at one point his wife was turned on her side and \u2018there was a flood of blood on the bed\u2019 which left a stain the size of a double A4-sided sheet of paper on the covers. It was \u2018clear she was bleeding heavily\u2019, he claimed, adding \u2018she was quite pale and clammy, paler than usual\u2019. She was later moved to King\u2019s College Hospital in Denmark Hill, south-east London, where the family was told she needed a liver transplant. The family were later told that they \u2018were out of options\u2019 and Miss Nelson died on February 2. Mr Ramirez, who had gone to the family home in Sydenham, south-east London, to await a call to say that his wife had gone in to labour, told the court: \u2018From my understanding of the documents and statements we have seen, it does seem there was some gaps in her monitoring which obviously does leave me with the question of what would have happened if I had stayed?\u2019 He said that he hoped the inquest would not become a \u2018forum for belittling\u2019 all of the care that his wife received. He said: \u2018Both Gillian and myself have been strong supporters of the NHS. It would be my hope that this is not a forum for belittling the intention of the care that she was provided. 'Certainly the family has seen excellent care in King\u2019s College Hospital where she was transferred, and seen a real intention to make sure that Gillian survived. We have seen some excellent support. 'But we are really concerned about understanding what happened to Gillian rather than casting blame on any particular member of staff or anything of that nature.\u2019 Place of death: Mr Ramirez was called to the Princess Royal University Hospital (above) in Bromley, Kent, at about 3.45am after his wife had gone in to labour. She had given birth by the time he arrived at 4.25am . Miss Nelson's condition went downhill between 4.25 and 5.45am. She had told a staff member that she had lost some blood while she was in a toilet, before giving birth at around 4am. Midwife Cathy Lowther told the inquest that Miss Nelson was being regularly observed. She recalled: \u2018There was a lot going on in the room with the baby. I think our team was tied up with the care of the baby to start off with.\u2019 Miss Nelson was given fluids probably to try to raise her blood pressure and it was spotted that her haemoglobin had dropped, meaning there was not enough oxygen going around her body, the inquest heard. Ms Lowther suggested \u2018you would put it down to blood loss\u2019. Then Miss Nelson later appeared to be short of breath and, from being \u2018awake and alert\u2019, she was \u2018very sleepy\u2019, according to Ms Lowther. She was \u2018very pale\u2019 and was given a blood transfusion. Ms Lowther said she did not remember Miss Nelson's skin being \u2018cold and clammy\u2019 - the description earlier given to the inquest by Mr Ramirez. Miss Nelson was taken to theatre for surgery by 6.40am. The inquest was adjourned to tomorrow at 9am.",

        "article": "London (CNN)Ever written yourself a note, stuffed it in your pocket and headed out into the world only to discover that, somewhere along your journey, the piece of paper has disappeared? If you live in the UK, there's a small chance that note has found its way into the hands of 23-year-old Daisy Bentley. For the past six years, the London-based artist has scoured the streets of cities and towns looking for those odd bits of paper that flutter to the ground when their owners aren't looking. Her quest has uncovered a fascinating, if idiosyncratic, collection of shopping lists, reminders, requests, love notes and motivational musings, all poignant pieces of others' lives. And now a gallery in London has put a selection on display for the public. \"I wasn't intending to start a collection,\" she told CNN. \"I always naturally collected things -- as many artists do -- and it got to the point that I was picking up every one I saw. Now I can barely walk down a street without picking up a scrap of paper.\" Bentley began collecting them six years ago after a note caught her eye one rainy night on a walk in her home town of Norwich, England. It's something she confesses has been a lifelong love -- keepsakes ranging from her mother's cutlery to her own dead goldfish have ended up carefully preserved in her collection for posterity. The notes project, she says, is a culmination of keeping her eyes on the sidewalk and spotting the little things that most people wouldn't notice as they walked down the street. \"I get very odd looks from strangers,\" she admits, \"but since I've made friends and families aware of the project, they get very excited when I find one while out with them.\" And while some dismiss such behavior as hoarding, Bentley feels it is part of human nature to hold on to items, no matter how small or insignificant they may seem. \"Humans want to collect and show to others,\" she says. \"They want to share and learn from the things they have found.\" She says her collecting has led to interesting anthropological insights into the human condition. One of her favorite observations is the evolution of handwriting over the past few decades, from the beautiful copperplate penmanship of the '70s to modern teen girl love notes with hearts dotting i's and multiple exclamation marks. More recently, the note collection has led to an exhibition at Stour Space gallery in London's Hackney Wick, where Bentley works as a shop and studio manager. It showcases a small part of her 1,500-strong collection. The decision to display the notes came in part from a desire to put them back into the public space. \"I always wanted to showcase them, to see what people's reactions were and if anyone would come forward,\" she said. So far two note owners -- one a colleague from the gallery and one an employee from a pub whose beer coasters she had found on her quest -- have revealed themselves as owners of notes. Bentley gave them framed prints as a thank you. And while some may find the notion of handwritten notes quaint, as social media and smartphones begin to replace handwriting, Bentley says she finds the note collection an interesting way for an artist to explore people's lives. \"Technology is useful, but sometimes the simplest ways are still the best,\" she said. \"I still usually draw a map rather than relying on technology to get to a place -- and many people are just the same.\"",

Now an Israeli team of developers has built a 'thermal protection' case that not only warns you when your phone is getting too hot, it will\u00a0automatically\u00a0cool it down. Called Amited, the case uses micro-fans to blow heat away from the device, or can heat a phone using resistance coils if it gets too cold. Scroll down for video . The Optimal case (pictured) was designed by Israel-based Amited. Sensors in the case monitor the phone's temperature and if it gets too hot, Optimal will cool the device using two built-in micro-fans. And if it gets too hot, Optimal engages its Anti-Freeze protection mode to gently heat the phone using resistance coils . The recommended storage temperature for most batteries is 15\u00b0C (59\u00b0F), while the 'extreme allowable' temperature is 40\u00b0C to 50\u00b0C (40\u00b0C to 122\u00b0F). Studies have found that a phone is most efficient when it's between 0\u00b0 and 35\u00b0C (32\u00b0F to 95\u00b0F), and keeping it as near room temperature as possible (22\u00b0 C or 72\u00b0F ) is ideal. At an average temperature of 0\u00b0C (32\u00b0F), a lithium-ion battery will lose six per cent of its maximum capacity every year. At 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F) degrees that number jumps to 20 per cent. Optimal syncs with a smartphone over Bluetooth and constantly analyses the phone's temperature when Auto mode is enabled, using built-in temperature and humidity sensors. Optimal syncs with a smartphone over Bluetooth and constantly analyses the phone's temperature when Auto mode is enabled, using built-in temperature and humidity sensors. The board and fans are pictured . Auto mode can be disabled and users can also manually track temperature changes using an app. This app shows  changes over time, but also reveals which apps in particular are having the highest thermal effect on the phone. Users can then set their own custom temperatures zones and set alarm thresholds . Inside the 0.19-inch (5mm) thick case is a pair of 'virtually silent', 0.07inch (2mm) micro-fans with air flow of 1.3 litres per minute.\u00a0These dissipate the heat and cool the phone down. Amited is also fitted with an ultra-thin heating coils attached to the back of a conductive copper plate. When Optimal notices a drop in temperature, Anti-Freeze mode will engage these coils to stop the phone from freezing, even in sub-freezing conditions. Optimal's sensors are pictured. When Optimal's air vents are blocked, for example when the phone is in a pocket or bag, it will alert the user to warn them the temperature in their phone needs to be corrected. Alternatively, the phone can use Optimal's built-in battery as a backup . Optimal is fitted with temperature sensors, resistance coils and two 2mm micro-fans.

And if the phone gets too hot, Optimal engages its Anti-Freeze protection to gently heat the phone using the resistance coils.

Alternatively, the phone can use Optimal's built-in battery as a backup. Amited is launching an Indiegogo campaign to fund production of the case (pictured) on 9 April.

Batteries exposed to hot temperatures lose their ability to store energy and the hotter the temperature, the faster they lose this ability. Extreme heatcan also cause permanent battery failure if exposed for long periods. In the cold, when the temperatures drop low enough, the phone could think its battery is empty even if it\u2019s fully charged. The colder it gets, the least amount of energy that the battery can provide. In addition, the internal resistance of the battery grows, causing the output voltage to drop. When Auto mode is enabled, these subtle temperature changes are tracked automatically, but this mode can be disabled and users can manually track these changes using the Optimal app. This app shows temperature changes over time, but also reveals which apps  are having the highest thermal effect on the phone. Users can then set custom operation modes based on their activity and location, set their own custom temperatures zones and set alarm thresholds. 'Heat is the worst enemy of your smartphone battery,' said Amited. 'Like all electronics, constant exposure to the elements will have a negative impact on your smartphone. 'Intense usage will lead to overheating, while extreme cold weather will lead to some circuits freezing inside your smartphone. 'In time, these can affect the performance of your phone\u2019s CPU, battery and GPU. And, eventually, they\u2019ll let you down completely.'

Instead, there was only one issue on the agenda, brought about by Raheem Sterling's television interview 24 hours earlier. The interview in which he suddenly seemed happy to discuss that unsigned \u00a3100,000-a-week contract, assert he is a trophy-hunter rather than a money-grabber and, perhaps most alarming of all, admit he is flattered by interest from Saturday's opponents from north London. Raheem Sterling looks relaxed during Liverpool's training session on Thursday morning . Sterling shakes hands with his manager Brendan Rodgers during the Melwood training session . Sterling appeared to give his manager a pat on the back as they talked during training . Rodgers issues instructions to Sterling as Liverpool prepare for Saturday's match with Arsenal . Instead of talking about the race for a Champions League pot of gold, Rodgers found himself again discussing the subject of Sterling's silver. The response seemed well prepared, a message of solidarity combined with a show of strength. Sterling is going nowhere was the emphatic statement. And if there were any suggestion from the 20-year-old that Liverpool need to convince him they can match his ambition, the message from Rodgers was equally clear: count yourself lucky to be here. 'Arsenal is a fantastic football club, of course, but this is Liverpool, one of the great clubs of the football world,' said the Anfield boss . 'It's an honour for Raheem to play here at a club like Liverpool in front of our great supporters and he understands that. He sees that. 'If Raheem has said his ambition is to win trophies and be successful, then it's perfectly aligned with what we're trying to do.' There was a reminder to Sterling and his representatives that his stock has risen on the back of the work Liverpool have done with him and the faith Rodgers has placed in the player. He is, Rodgers remarked, not yet the finished article. Not yet of the same calibre as Luis Suarez who eventually got his move away from Merseyside. Sterling admitted he was 'flattered' by interest from Arsenal as his contract talks are put on hold . Sterling and Daniel Sturridge share a joke on the training ground during Thursday morning's session . The players were in a relaxed mood despite the continued speculation over Sterling's future at the club . The England international cast doubt on his Liverpool future in an interview with the BBC on Wednesday . 'Now, as a 20-year-old, no he's not at that level,' said Rodgers. 'Raheem has been involved with the first team for two-and-a-half years and the player he is today \u2014 and he still has a lot of improvements to make \u2014 is because of the environment and what we've created here. 'He's still got learning and development to make on and off the pitch. We feel this is a great place for him. We'll very much focus on trying to make him the best player we can. 'He's a young player who has developed a lot and that's because of one reason, which is Liverpool. So we're quite relaxed on that and we'll concentrate on his football, hopefully. 'For us it's really about continuing to nurture the development of a young player who has made huge strides and someone who we believe we still have a lot of input into his development to come so he can be consistently a player playing at the top of his game.' There is a growing feeling that Sterling and his representatives are attempting to force Liverpool's hand here and orchestrate a move back to London, where Arsenal and Chelsea would welcome him home with open arms. Certainly the mixed messages over the contract stalemate in recent months have been confusing. Is it about money? Is it about trophies? Is it about Sterling's best position? Sterling trains alongside Brazilian Philippe Coutinho as the Liverpool team get ready for Saturday's match . Sterling and Emre Can leap during one of the training ground exercises on Thursday morning . Sterling takes his turn on the ladders as Liverpool prepare for Saturday's vital match against Arsenal . The latter, according to Rodgers, should not be an issue. Most important of all is that Sterling is a first-team regular getting the kind of opportunities that young players do not elsewhere. The manager drew comparisons with Steven Gerrard. 'Every player will have a position to play,' he said. 'I pick the best team and what is key for him \u2014 and I'm sure he understands \u2014 is that he's getting the opportunity to play. 'If you look through this league and in Europe, there aren't many playing at 17, 18, 19 or 20. 'Every player will want to play but he only needs to look at Steven Gerrard in his time here. He played in a back three, as a wing back, right back, left back, central midfield, as a No 10. 'It doesn't bother me. I pick the best team and he will probably sit back, reflect and think he is playing, which not many young kids are. 'He's a boy who genuinely loves his football. He's played all over the field for me but he understands and respects the opportunity that he's had to play all over the field. It's been great for him and his career.' Sterling denied he was a 'money-grabber' in the interview, saying he was only concerned about football . Liverpool find themselves five points behind Manchester United in the battle for the top four places . Rodgers organises the footballs during Liverpool's Thursday morning training session . There is little doubt that Sterling's interview has been unhelpful in the extreme, but there remains a determination at Anfield to keep the player onside and head off a contract crisis. To that end, Rodgers struck a conciliatory tone on Thursday. 'We speak regularly with Raheem and I just see him work and work well,' Rodgers said. 'He's been injured and there is probably a bit of frustration there because he's not been totally clear and he's a boy who just loves to play, train and be on the field. 'You have seen what can happen with players and representatives, but I can only speak openly and honestly with Raheem. He has made it clear he is happy and hopefully he can do his talking on the field. 'My concentration is on working with the player. He is a young man. He has had trauma in his life and he is a tough boy and you see that in how he plays, but he is still very young. He still needs guidance and help \u2014 that is pretty clear.'

A mother has been arrested for referring to her African-American neighbors as 'apes' during a dispute over a parking space. Eva Chapin, 34, from West Linn, Oregon, was booked into jail after she left a string of offensive post-it notes on the door of the family home. The qualified nurse referred to the residents, who are believed to have roots in Ghana, as 'n*****' but wrote: 'I am not racist'. One of the notes, seen by KATU, read: 'Apes were never meant to drive so stop.' Another said: 'I've been here 22 years and no [expletive] and now you. U made me hate [expletive] now.' 'I'm not racist,' one of the notes allegedly said, 'but I can see how someone can become [sic] hating [expletive]. You did this. There were no [expletive] in W.L. until u came.' Another, which the victims were most disturbed by, said: 'U look like a monkey and you smell like 1 too [sic].' A woman who lives next door, who only wanted to be identified as Elizabeth, told the station she is struggling to explain the content of the messages to her teenage daughter. 'She came back from school supposed to be happy,' she said. 'This is what she saw.' 'My little daughter came from school to see this note,' she added. 'I feel like I\u2019m not safe here.' She has been living in the neighborhood for 11 years but now plans to move. Mark Cogan, a friend of Elizabeth, told KPTV: 'That anybody would feel entitled to address somebody else in the community with this abusive, disgusting, foul, inappropriate language, just makes me sick.'

Kevin Franklin, of Dunstable, Bedfordshire, says he will switch his lights on every evening in April for Autism Awareness Month. Mr Franklin's 15-year-old son Bradley is autistic and the family want to use his Christmas light show to raise awareness for charities working with those with the disability. Kevin Franklin will light up his Christmas lights on the front of his home tonight for Autism Awareness Month . The 53-year-old father put the lights up on his council house last November in preparation for Christmas. But he didn't take them down in January because he wanted to switch the lights on again in April for Autism Awareness Month. The continued presence of the lights in recent weeks has angered some neighbours, prompting a poison pen letter last month. It read: 'I am fed up of seeing your grotesque tacky council house Christmas lights. It is March, for goodness sake. Your house leaves this lovely community looking a disgrace. 'It looks like a state. It sticks out like a sore thumb. I don't want to keep driving past this eyesore, every time I do, my kids scream. I know you live in a council house, but there's no need to make it look like one.' The letter finished 'Yours sincerely, a very disgruntled citizen.' The father kept them up after Christmas ahead of autism week, prompting anger from some neighbours . The continued presence of the light, prompted one local resident to write this abusive message to Mr Franklin . Mr Franklin, who has been medically retired from work after suffering two strokes and a heart attack, said today: 'I will be putting on the lights tonight when it gets dark and switch them off again around 10pm. This will happen throughout April for Autism Awareness Month. 'That was always my plan and it's why, back in January, I decided not to take them down because I knew I would be putting them up again in April. 'I would have taken the lights down after April but now I'm going to leave them on the house out of principle, but I won't be turning them on again until December 2.' The former publican added: 'It's been blown out of all proportion and has turned into a row between council house tenants and those who own their properties. 'Some people think we are scum because we rent, but my house looks a lot tidier than some of those that have been bought by the occupants. 'We are all human beings and the only difference is they have bought their pile of bricks and I rent mine.' He says his nearest neighbours support him in his idea to raise awareness of charities. He added: 'I've even heard some neighbours saying they will donate to charity and I've been told that some people around Dunstable may even put up their own Christmas lights in support.' He said he planned to take them down next month, but now will keep them up 'out of principle'",

        "article": "Jay Z launched a stream of tweets defending his premium music streaming app Tidal after the service, launched last month, was described as a flop. His social media diatribe comes as reports claim that Tidal is being sabotaged by rivals as it attempts to take business away from more-established music outlets such as Spotify and Apple. 'We may not be perfect - but we are determined,' he said while claiming that there are 'many big companies that are spending millions on a smear campaign'. 'We are here for the long haul,' the rapper and businessman tweeted in a string of 'stream of consciousness' messages. Scroll down for video . Twitter rant: Jay Z unleashed a string of 'stream of consciousness' tweets on Sunday defending his premium music streaming service Tidal and saying that it is still early days for the app . Tidal tweets: Using the hashtag #TidalFacts, the rap mogul told naysayers that 'actions will speak louder than words' as he continues to fine tune the streaming service he purchased for $56 million in January . Equality for all: The rapper and businessman insisted that Tidal is good for all artists and not just a money-maker for the big name artists like Kanye, Rihanna and Madonna who have joined him as co-founders . Feeling the need to vent: Jay Z decided to take to social media on Sunday in an aggressive push after what he saw as a 'smear campaign' from big companies against Tidal . Jay Z, who paid $56 million for TIDAL's technology in January and relaunched it in March, went on the offensive against the supposed smear campaign. Tidal has potential rivals including popular streaming service Spotify and tech giant Apple, though Jay Z did not post any details about the alleged campaign. After Tidal was criticized because of the wealth of its founders, the rapper said that other big tech companies also have huge amounts of money. 'Rich getting richer? Equity values... YouTube $390 billion. Apple $760 billion. Spotify $8 billion. Tidal $60 million,' he said. On Sunday Page Six\u00a0claimed that there's also a 'war' looming between Tidal and Apple. Citing industry sources, the New York Post's gossip site alleged that tech giant Apple is trying to impede Tidal ahead of the scheduled relaunch in June of its own Beats Music by taking a long time to approve iOS updates for the Tidal app. 'Tidal had a new app on Android on April 15, but still hasn\u2019t received approval for Apple\u2019s iOS app store,' a source said. The site claimed that after Rihanna's song American Oxygen debuted on Tidal, there were technical problems with her music on iTunes. Apple told Page Six that the allegations that Rihanna's songs were deliberately scrambled are not true. The spokesperson declined to comment on the other claims made in the article, according to Page Six. War looming: A report from Page Six on Sunday said that Apple, which is launching its own music service, is trying to stop any growth by Tidal by delaying availability of updates for its app . Big guns: Tidal charges users $19.99 a month for its premium music streaming service and aims to take on rivals such as Spotify, Pandora and Apple's iTunes. Madonna and Rihanna are among the company's backers . In the same article, Page Six also alleged that Robert Kondrk, vice president of iTunes Content, has said any artists who put out exclusive music on Tidal won't be featured artists on iTunes. The article also reported that Sony Music will not grant Tidal a license to stream from Sony artists, one of whom is, of course, Jay Z's wife Beyonce. A representative for Sony Music declined to comment to Page Six. A month ago, some of the biggest names in music joined Jay Z for the launch of Tidal but the $19.99 a month subscription service is floundering in the app downloads charts. According to Billboard.com\u00a0on Sunday, Tidal, which launched on March 30, has fallen out of Apple's top 750 apps, after a peak at No. 83 on April 7. The rapper's Twitter rant and news of tensions with other tech companies come after a week of bad press for TIDAL. The company's CEO Andy Chen also recently left the company amid a 'streamlining' of staff. Even those close to Jay-Z were seen as moving away from the potential failure. Co-founder Kanye West changed his Twitter avatar away from a logo for the service and deleted all mention of it from his account earlier this week. He later reaffirmed his support for the service in a tweet saying 'The love of music is louder than words'. Despite reports of its stuttering start, Jay-Z insisted on Twitter that Tidal is doing just fine. 'We have over 770,000 subs. We have been in business less than one month,' he tweeted, and included the hashtag #TidalFacts. Tweet of support: Canadian producer and performer Deadmaus5, who joined Jay Z on stage at the New York relaunch of Tidal on March 31, used his Twitter account Sunday to support the company . Tidal is co-owned by Jay Z, Kanye West, Beyonce, Madonna, Rihanna, Jack White, Alicia Keys and others. In his Sunday stream of tweets, Jay Z stressed that the service pays a 75 percent royalty rate to all artists and not just the high profile founders who appeared on stage at the launch. Other info he shared under the hashtag #TidalFacts included that 'iTunes Store wasn't built in a day' and 'It took Spotify 9 years to be successful.' TIDAL has attempted to differentiate away from its competitors by billing itself as having higher quality audio and being focused on rewarding those making music. Jay-Z referenced Tidal X which 'supports artists by giving them a platform to connect with their most loyal fans. Tidal is for all.' Canadian producer and performer Deadmaus5, who joined Jay Z on stage for the Tidal \u00a0launch in New York, jumped on the bandwagon Sunday. He tweeting his followers: \u00a0'despite whatever dumbs**t preconceptions you may or may not have about tidal, im still behind it. Im in it for industry growth, not PR. (sic).' Several artists have publicly criticized the roll-out, saying that Jay Z made it seem as if some of the world's biggest musicians wanted more money. 'When they say it's artist-owned, it's owned by those rich, wealthy artists,' Marcus Mumford, the frontman of Mumford & Sons, said in a recent and widely-disseminated interview with The Daily Beast website. Friction: Page Six claimed Sunday that Sony Music won't give Tidal a license to stream music by artists signed to it labels, which include Jay Z's wife Beyonce . Not all artists are fans: Marcus Mumford of Mumford & Sons has criticized Tidal saying it's just a way for wealthy artists to get richer .",

        "article": "Comments sections and social networks across the web are littered with antisocial users who repeatedly abuse and provoke people to get a reaction. These so-called 'trolls' have even been known to cause mental distress to their victims. But now a team of researchers has studied millions of such online posts to identify common traits among these users. And it has built an algorithm that can recognise a potential troll with an accuracy of 80 per cent by scanning their comments. Experts studied 40 million posts by 1.7 millions users on news site CNN.com, political news site Breitbart.com and gaming site IGN.com. \u00a0The researchers then divided users into those most likely to be banned, called Future-Banned Users (FBUs), and other users dubbed Never-Banned Users (NBUs) The research was carried out by PhD students from Stanford and Cornell University, led by Justin Chang, in a paper called Antisocial Behavior in Online Discussion Communities. The team examined three large online forums including general news site CNN.com, Breitbart.com, a political news site, and computer gaming site IGN.com. Within these communities members that repeatedly violate community guidelines can be banned, either temporarily or permanently. Over an 18-month period, the team studied the content and deletion rates of 40 million posts and 100 million votes posted by 1.7 million users across these sites. From this data they were able to divide users into two groups. Posts made by antisocial web users, or trolls, are less readable in terms of language and coherency. Trolls are more likely to veer off-topic and have fewer similarities in terms of language and content compared to posts by other users. Trolls are also less likely to use positive words than other users, they swear more, and use\u00a0less tentative or conciliatory language such as 'could', 'perhaps', or 'consider'. In terms of activity, the study found that trolls make more comments each day, and post more times on each thread. They purposefully try to create discussions, or actively respond to an on-going discussion. Trolls were also more likely to have had posts deleted than other users and over the 18 month study period, the number of deleted posts by FBUs increased. People who, over the course of the study, were subsequently banned from the sites, or were likely to be, were classified as Future-Banned Users (FBUs). Users who weren't banned during the study, and didn't exhibit signs that suggested they would be in the future, were known as Never-Banned Users (NBUs). Once these users were split up the researchers looked at four features to identify common traits among the FBUs and NBUs. The first was called 'Post features' and included studying the content of a post. 'Activity features' included how often a user posted in the forum, while 'Community features' looked at votes on individual posts that suggest a person or opinion's popularity. Lastly, 'Moderator features' looked at how many posts had been moderated or deleted. The findings suggest that posts written by FBUs are 'less readable', tend to veer off-topic and have fewer similarities in terms of language and content compared to posts by NBUs. The researchers compared the average text similarity of a user's post with the previous three posts in the same thread. 'We find that the average text similarity of posts written by FBUs is significantly lower than that of NBUs, suggesting that FBUs make less of an effort to integrate or stay on-topic,' said researchers. The team also found that while there was no consistent trend with respect to the use of words containing negative emotion among posts made by FBUs, they are less likely to use positive words. Posts made by antisocial web users, or trolls, are less readable (centre) in terms of language  and coherency and are more likely to veer off-topic and have fewer similarities than posts by other users (left). Trolls are also less likely to use positive words (right) than other users, and they swear more in posts . In terms of activity, the study found that trolls make more comments each day and post more times on each thread. They purposefully try to create discussions, or actively respond to an on-going discussion . FBUs are also more likely to swear and use less tentative or conciliatory language such as 'could', 'perhaps', or 'consider'. In terms of activity, the research also found that FBUs purposefully try to create discussions, or actively respond to an on-going discussion. As a result they spend more time in individual threads than NBUs. Previous research found that post frequency was a signal of low quality discussions. On Breitbart and IGN, trolls were more likely to reply to others' posts, but on CNN, they were more likely to start new discussions. Still, across all communities, FBUs appear to be 'effective at luring other users into potentially fruitless discussions', which is a sign of troll-like behaviour, said the study. Trolls were also more likely to have had posts deleted than other users and over the 18-month study period, the number of deleted posts by FBUs increased.\u00a0These traits are unlikely to help recognise a troll in their own right, but when combined, the researchers found they could be used to identify a troll with 80% accuracy . FBUs contribute significantly more posts per thread\u00a0they participate in, according to the results. Trolls were also more likely to have had more posts deleted than NBUs, and over 18 months, the number of deleted posts by FBUs increased. These individual identifiers and traits are unlikely to help recognise a troll or antisocial behaviours in their own right. However, when combined the researchers found they could identify a troll with an accuracy of 80 per cent. 'Understanding how antisocial users may steer individual discussions can help us better quantify their influence on other users,' concluded the researchers. 'Our initial explorations suggest that FBUs cause discussions to veer off-topic: replies to FBUs were significantly less similar to preceding posts in a thread than replies to NBUs. 'One could also investigate the effects of having multiple antisocial users participate in a discussion.' But they recognised the algorithm's accuracy rate meant that one in five antisocial users are undetected and further works needs to be done to boost this rate and work out effective ways of dealing with the trolls. The findings are published in arXiv.",

        "article": "The family of a heavily pregnant Jehovah's Witness who died along with her baby after she refused a blood transfusion, have defended the woman who they said had put her baby's life above her own. Jenny-Lee, 28, was diagnosed with leukaemia seven months into her pregnancy, and although doctors at Sydney's Prince of Wales Hospital in Randwick told her she could give birth via a caesarean section and undergo chemotherapy, she refused both options as they required her to receive a blood transfusion. However her mother Heather has told The Daily Telegraph that her daughter believed the cancer treatment would harm her unborn child, named Aroura. 'She knew chemo would kill Aroura \u2014 she put the baby first each and every time and no matter what happened, she wanted that baby alive,' Heather said. A pregnant Jehovah's Witness woman and her baby have died after she refused a blood transfusion . 'We were told she would have six weeks to live \u2014 she fought to have the baby. That's the decision she made \u2014 she gave up her life.' Instead she blamed local doctors for her daughter's unnecessary death, claiming they should have tested her for the cancer sooner, but instead only attributed her symptoms to the flu and her pregnancy. The Sydney mother's baby died in utero three days after she was offered a caesarean. She had a stillbirth and died 13 days after her diagnosis by suffering a stroke and multi-organ failure. Jenny-Lee's elder daughter Chelsie, who was only 10 when her mother died in August 2009, also defended her mother. However the 28-year-old's brother David blamed the religion for how his sister died, calling her a 'fool'. 'It was not my sister who was sad and selfish, it is this religion and any other teaching this sort of nonsense,' he said. Jenny-Lee, 28, had pregnancy complications due to her leukaemia but rejected treatment on religious grounds . Her treating haematologist at the Prince of Wales Hospital in Randwick, Dr Giselle Kidson-Gerber, said the mother understood the risks of her refusal to accept blood. 'Her refusal to receive a blood transfusion meant that we were unable to perform a caesarean section and to deliver the foetus,' Dr Kidson-Gerber told Daily Mail Australia. 'Obviously it's a very big ethical issue. Legally in Australia the mother has the right to make decisions on her behalf and her foetus's behalf. 'Most mothers would make decisions in favour of the unborn baby and this was a decision that was not in favour of the unborn baby.' Dr Kidson-Gerber added: 'If we were to give chemotherapy without blood transfusion support she surely would have died.' She was being treated at the Royal Hospital for Women and the Prince of Wale Hospital in Randwick . Hospital staff were 'distressed' over what were perceived to be two avoidable deaths, as 83 percent of pregnant leukaemia sufferers go into remission with treatment. Dr Kidson-Gerber said it was a\u00a0challenge\u00a0to respect a patient who refuses life-saving treatment. 'It was sad. I think that I did my best to help her. But ultimately I couldn't change the course of events,' she said. In a recent article published in the Internal Medicine Journal about the 2009 case, Dr Kidson-Gerber and her colleague Dr Amber\u00a0Biscoe wrote:\u00a0'Not administering blood products in this case undoubtedly contributed to the death of mother and foetus. 'Refusal of a lifesaving intervention by an informed patient is generally well respected, but the rights of a mother to refuse such interventions on behalf of her foetus is more controversial.' Sascha Callaghan, an expert in ethics and law at the University of Sydney said the current law allows the mother to make decisions that would directly affect her unborn baby, the\u00a0Sydney Morning Herald reported. She said Jehovah's Witnesses are often condemned for their beliefs, especially in relation to their stance against blood transfusions. 'This woman has a long-held commitment to the Jehovah's Witness faith and that's how she chose to die,' she told the Herald. 'When your foetus is in utero, it is inextricably tied to your life.' Jehovah's Witnesses refuse blood transfusions because they believe the Bible commands them to abstain from ingesting blood and that avoiding blood pays respect to God as the giver of life.

        "article": "(CNN)Jacob Lawrence's groundbreaking work, \"The Migration of the Negro,\" is a series of 60 small paintings with text depicting the lives of millions of pre-World War II blacks as they moved from the oppressive South to the promise of a better life in the North. One frame in particular, No. 22, shows three black men dressed in their Sunday best, handcuffed, heads bowed standing in front of a window adorned with prison bars. The caption reads: . \"Another of the social causes of the migrants' leaving was that at times they did not feel safe, or it was not the best thing to be found on the streets late at night. They were arrested on the slightest provocation.\" Lawrence painted this picture around 1940. This is important to know because there are some people who blame President Barack Obama for racial tension in America as if the March on Washington scrubbed away the lasting effects of 300 years of inequality. No. 22 was painted before hip-hop became the pi\u00f1ata for conservative talk show hosts to bash and before sagging pants became a popular fashion statement. Some of us keep looking for a new reason why this old problem continues to haunt us because to think otherwise requires effort. It's a lot easier to retweet a Dr. King meme. It is more convenient to say the violence began when rioters threw bricks at police and not when a city's Police Department began terrorizing its residents. We criticize Baltimore's mayor for not \"restoring order\" as if paying victims of police brutality nearly $6 million in a four-year span is \"order.\" Now, some people are partially blaming the 2013 movie \"The Purge\" for the uprising in Baltimore as if the 1996 riots in St. Petersburg, Florida, happened on a different planet. Or that the more than 100 cases of Baltimore police brutality that were either lost or settled out of court since 2011 provide no insight as to what the residents have been dealing with for some time. An 87-year-old grandmother had her shoulder broken by overzealous police, and Sen. Rand Paul -- God bless him -- suggested the rise in absentee fathers is the reason for this latest clash. It is true only 34% of black children live in a two-family household today, and I do believe that is a problem. Soul searching, as the President suggested, is something that needs to be had by all. But it is also true that 65% of black children lived with both parents in 1960, and yet there was still a lack of trust between the police and the minority community. Sen. Paul's rationale falls apart when you consider that John Henry Crawford III was shot and killed by police at a Walmart in Ohio while on the phone talking with the mother of his two children. Crawford's father was literally playing with his two grandchildren as his son was being gunned down. In 1971, Marvin Gaye cracked the Top 10 on the pop charts with \"Inner City Blues,\" which included the lines: . Crime is increasing . Trigger happy policing . Panic is spreading . God knows where we're heading . And yet so many look at the protests, uprisings and yes, sometimes riots, with this incredulous demeanor as if the raw emotions captured on camera are materializing out of thin air. No backdrop. No historical context. Television journalists asking questions that seem to characterize the recent developments as unexplained anger detached from any tangible issue. It is as if they believe the absence of burning crosses translated into peace and harmony. Meanwhile, Louisiana state police want people to believe Victor White III shot himself in the chest while handcuffed sitting in the back of a police car. How can there be peace when the Department of Justice found black residents in Ferguson were preyed upon for years by a corrupt Police Department? Where is the harmony when the average white household has 13 times the wealth of its black counterpart? And we know the impact wealth has on education, housing and mortality. Now there is video of police in Inkster, Michigan, celebrating the beating of a suspect as he sits nearby with broken ribs, a head injury and bleeding. The officers fist pump and laugh. One of them even appears to joyfully re-enact parts of the incident in plain view of Floyd Dent, the man in custody. And when the incident in question was under investigation, the Inkster Police Department suppressed the video. Two months would go by before the public saw what we are paying for. But at least we saw it. In Chicago, the police department has yet to release dash cam video of the fatal encounter officers had with 17-year-old Laquan McDonald last October. The report said an officer fired shots into McDonald's chest after the teen lunged at them with a knife. Witnesses said the shooting was unjustified. The autopsy shows McDonald was shot 16 times from a variety of angles by the officer. The City Council recently approved a $5 million settlement but maintains there was no wrongdoing. The video could shed some light on what really happened...which may explain why we have yet to see it. This comes on the heels of Mayor Rahm Emanuel establishing a $5.5 million reparations fund for victims of former CPD commander John Burge. For three decades Burge and his team ran a torture ring that used electric shock, burned and beat up more than 100 black men. And some look at Baltimore and the protests happening all around the country and wonder where all of this rage is coming from? This mistrust didn't come from somewhere. It's always been here. Woven in the comedic deliveries of Richard Pryor, Dick Gregory and Dave Chappelle; saturated within the prose of Lorraine Hansberry, Maya Angelou and Shonda Rhimes; heard in soulful cries of Billie Holiday's \"Strange Fruit\" to John Legend standing on an Oscar stage singing \"one day, when the glory comes it will be ours.\" For decades, the works of black artists have explicitly talked about the Baltimores of this country and though their work has been celebrated and curated, the message remains lost. Why else would someone believe sagging pants and hoodies are to blame for mass incarcerations? That President Obama is the reason why some blacks are frustrated with police and not the dynamic beautifully captured by Lawrence 75 years ago. Before President Richard Nixon started the war on drugs. Before Eric Garner started selling loose cigarettes in Staten Island. Before Baltimore became the setting of a critically acclaimed TV show. There isn't a new reason why Freddie Gray's death triggered outrage. Just new ways for people to validate apathy and explain away racism.",

        "article": "Ironing may be the Marmite of household chores. But, love it or loathe it, unless you want to look like you\u2019ve slept on a park bench, you can\u2019t avoid it. British company Swan, which sold its first iron in 1933, has just released a top-of-the-range steam generator iron, for \u00a3279.99. But does it really make things easier? Tessa Cunningham finds out. SUPER STEAMER . Swan SI9031N Steam Generator Iron, \u00a3279.99, swan-brand.co.uk . If you loathe ironing enough to splash out almost \u00a3300, then Swan\u2019s luxury model could be the one for you. It cut my ironing time by half. It\u2019s usually my least favouite chore, but when testing this one, I got to work in front of Poldark and was done within 20 minutes. Because all the water is in the separate 1,000ml generator tank, the iron itself is lightweight. The steam is forced out of the generator through a hose into the iron, shooting out at 90g per minute \u2014 twice as fast as conventional steam irons (think of the difference in power between jet-washing and using a hosepipe) \u2014 cutting through creases quicker. As well as being more powerful, it also produces twice as much steam, making shorter work of wrinkles. On the downside, despite the investment, you get only a two-year guarantee. 3/5 . PRECISION PERFECT . Philips Easy Speed Plus, \u00a329.50, amazon.co.uk . The big selling point of this pretty aqua blue iron is the precision tip, which means you can get really sharp creases flat with minimum elbow grease, making it perfect for shirts and trousers. I also love the vertical steam option, which means you can smooth creases from hanging fabrics, such as curtains, by holding the iron vertically 2 in away and pressing the steam button. Steam output is 35g per minute \u2014 with a boost function of up to 120g to blast at stubborn creases. Impressive for the price. 4/5 . BARGAIN BUY . Swan Steam Iron SI1001ON, \u00a319.99, argos.co.uk . This does an adequate job and you get a lot for your money \u2014 including a generous 350ml water tank and variable steam control, which means you can opt for continuous steam at 40g per min or a 140g per minute shot of steam. But it\u2019s so heavy, at 1.3kg, that I\u2019m in danger of developing muscles like Popeye if I keep using it. And while the dolphin-shaped nose helps me reach tricky areas, such as around shirt buttons, it makes the iron look downright ugly. I also found the soleplate scaled up quickly. 2/5 . POWER HOUSE . Braun TexStyle 7 TS755, \u00a349.99, johnlewis.com . This looks like a fighter jet, and is so heavy (1.3kg empty and 1.65kg when the water tank is full) it makes ironing even more of an effort. On the plus side, the ergonomic handle is easy to hold. I also like the way the cable is 2.5m long \u2014 useful if you can\u2019t get near a plug. It\u2019s impressively powerful. Steam shoots out at 50g per minute and the precision shot also releases steam at 170g per minute. 3/5 . LIGHTWEIGHT PRO . Russell Hobbs Autosteam Pro Iron, \u00a319.99, argos.co.uk . One of the cheapest irons I tried, this is beautifully lightweight at 1.14kg despite having a large 320ml water tank. There are lots of functions such as a non-stick soleplate and a vertical steam option. You also get a generous two-metre cord. But it falls down on the one job I\u2019m paying for \u2014 ironing. Although it is supposed to be non-drip, it leaked at low temperatures and left unsightly marks on my silk shirt. 2/5 . VALUE FOR MONEY . Philips PerfectCare Pure Steam Generator, \u00a3119.99, robertdyas.co.uk . The nearest rival to the Swan iron and less than half the price, this is fantastic value for a top-range model bursting with extras. I normally dread ironing my grandmother\u2019s thick linen table cloth, but I removed every crease in seconds with no effort. It\u2019s all thanks to the impressive 1.5-litre water reservoir which pumps out high-pressure steam at 110g per minute. And the soleplate is designed so steam is distributed evenly \u2014 meaning fewer strokes and speedy ironing. The manufacturer boasts that you never need to change the settings as it creates the perfect temperature level whether you are ironing silk PJs or kids\u2019 jeans. I tried it \u2014 and it was true. You also get a five-year guarantee. 5/5 . CORDLESS POWER . Tefal Freemove FV9970, \u00a379.99, johnlewis.com . Tefal is hugely proud of its cordless iron. And with good reason. The base recharges the iron during each rest period, which means there is no cord getting in your way, and the control panel lets you know when you need to recharge. It\u2019s powerful, too \u2014 delivering an impressive 180g per minute shot of steam. The handy steam on-demand trigger got rid of stubborn creases in my partner\u2019s shirts. It also has a vertical steam option. I used it to blast away creases in a dress that had been hanging in my wardrobe for too long \u2014 much easier than dragging out the ironing board. If you\u2019re happy to pay over the odds to dispense with a cord, this is a great option. 3/5 . TURBO STEAM . Tefal Ultimate Anti-Calc FV9603, \u00a369.99, argos.co.uk . Lots of impressive features here \u2014 such as a unit which collects all the limescale from your iron. A turbo steam function delivers a mighty 200g per minute jet of steam and an anti-drip mechanism cuts down on the chances of water leaking. But this iron is too darn heavy: a stonking 1.5kg when empty; once the 350ml tank is full, it\u2019s like lifting a brick. On the plus side, it provides the perfect excuse to hand over the ironing to my partner. 3/5 .",

        "article": "(CNN)Officer Michael Slager's five-year career with the North Charleston Police Department in South Carolina ended after he resorted to deadly force following a routine traffic stop. Slager, 33, has been fired, officials said Wednesday. His wife is eight months' pregnant and the city will continue paying for her medical insurance until the baby is born, North Charleston Mayor Keith Summey told reporters. He also has two stepchildren. His mother was interviewed by ABC News on Thursday. She told ABC her son loved being a police officer. \"I can't imagine him doing something that. ... It's not like him. That's just not his character,\" Karen Sharpe said. She told ABC she hasn't watched the video of the shooting. Slager initially told investigators that he used a Taser in a confrontation Saturday with Walter Scott, who was pulled over for a busted taillight. But Scott went for the Taser, according to Slager. A widely circulated video of the shooting death of the 50-year-old unarmed African-American man by the white police officer tells another story: Scott attempts to run. His back is to Slager, who, from a few yards away, raises his gun and fires. Slager is now charged with murder. The FBI is involved in the investigation of the slaying of the father of four. \"Shots fired and the subject is down,\" Slager said moments after the shooting, according to reports. \"He took my Taser.\" Slager was proficient with the nonlethal Taser. According to personnel records, he scored 50 out of 50 on a Taser certification exam in 2011. Before the officer starts firing at Scott, the video shows a dark object falling behind him and hitting the ground. It's not clear whether that is the Taser. Later in the video, when Slager approaches Scott's body, he drops a dark object next to the man. Again, it's not clear whether that's the Taser. It's unknown whether Scott took the officer's Taser or whether the officer picked the object up and moved it closer to the body. Slager was named in a police complaint in 2013 after he allegedly \"tased a man for no reason\" before slamming him to the ground and dragging him, according to the North Charleston Police Department. At the time, Slager was searching for a suspect who was described as being 5-feet-5-inches tall. The African-American man he confronted was 6-feet-3 inches tall. A lawyer for the man who filed the complaint, Mario Givens, said his client plans to file a lawsuit. \"The citizens of North Charleston shouldn't have to live in the fear,\" the lawyer, Eduardo Curry, told reporters Thursday. Givens said Slager came to his door, ordered him out of the house and then tased him. \"It was painful,\" he said. \"I fell. I have a couple bruises.\" Slager was later cleared in that incident. \"I was upset,\" Givens said. \"They took a real long time to even investigate the case.\" In another complaint in January, Slager was cited for failing to file a report after an African-American woman called police because her children were being harassed. Slager had worked as a waiter before joining the military, records show. He served in the U.S. Coast Guard from 2003 to 2009, according to a job application filed with the North Charleston Police Department. That application, filed in January 2009, said Slager had not been convicted of a felony in the past seven years. Personnel documents describe Slager as \"enthused\" when he joined the force and said he demonstrated \"great officer safety tactics\" in dealing with suspects. South Carolina senators, governor condemn police shooting . Slager's annual in-service mandatory training included a range of topics from first aid to firearms and Taser use. Slager passed his certifications. In August, Slager passed a firearms qualification. From 2009 to 2014, Slager qualified in the use of his Glock firearm. He received and passed yearly training in \"bias based profiling\" and \"ethics,\" the documents said. He also was certified by the S.C. Criminal Justice Academy in March 2013 as having \"met and successfully completed the in-service requirements\" as a law enforcement officer. Slager completed a separate 10-hour \"active shooter incident response training\" course in December 2013. According to the documents, Slager was involved in a \"nonpreventable\" traffic accident last year when a motorist with his car in reverse struck the officer's patrol car.  The driver fled the scene. Since graduating from the police academy in 2010, a supervisor twice noted in training reports that he \"spoke with (Slager) in reference to certain procedures in reference to conducting motor vehicle stops and citizen contacts.\" No other details were provided. Slager signed his oath of office with the police force on March 1, 2010, pledging to \"faithfully serve the citizens of this city\" and \"never abuse my authority either by words or acts.\" \"I will enforce the law courteously and appropriately without fear or favor, malice or ill will, never employing unnecessary force or violence,\" the oath said. Who was Walter Scott? CNN's John Newsome contributed to this report.",

The goose at first appeared to make it successfully through the operation at a bird and wildlife clinic Wednesday but then died a short time later, said Katie Ingram of Orange County Animal Care. 'The vet did everything that they could do,' Ingram told Los Angeles television station KNBC. 'We are unsure if it was due to the extent of the injuries or some other complication. We were all hoping for a happy ending for this little guy.' Scroll down for video . Dead goose: Goose with an arrow piercing its neck dies after surgery to remove the piercing object . Puncture wound:\u00a0The goose at first appeared to make it successfully through the arrow removal operation at a bird and wildlife clinic Wednesday but then died a short time later . Poor goose: Somehow this poor little goose ended up with an arrow through it's neck . She said the bird's skin had healed around the arrow and made the process more difficult. Animal officials had high hopes for the bird's recovery after its capture earlier Wednesday because it seemed in otherwise good health and the arrow had missed all its vital organs. A worker at the Anaheim Hills Car Wash befriended the goose several days ago by feeding it bread crumbs and was able to catch it and turn it over, Ingram said. She said the animal was shot intentionally at least a week ago. Animal control officers started getting calls on April 5 about the bird and found it after a call from Hole 5 at the Anaheim Hills Golf Course on April 8, Ingram said. The birds are not native to the area, so it was probably living near the course or was someone's pet. The cause of the birds injuries are unknown but officials believe it was the victim of animal cruelty. Animal cruelty officers planned to launch an investigation into the assault and fingerprint the arrow after it was removed from the goose's neck. The investigation still stands but sadly the goose will waddle no more. Evaded care: The duck ran from animal care workers for at least a week after it was pierced in the neck . Tragic death: Veterinarians at an area bird and wildlife clinic examined the bird and said it appeared to be in good health, except for the arrow that missed all its vital organs .

Known for its empowering campaigns and championing of real women, Dove has taken a more brutal approach in its latest advertisement. Showing the harsh criticism that women regularly heap upon themselves, Dove decided to see what would happen when somebody else said those things, to their faces. Scroll down for video . For the new One Beautiful Thought ad campaign, Dove asked a group of women to write down every thought they had about themselves. The women filled in a notebook each, and handed it back to Dove . Unbeknownst to the women, those negative remarks and self-body shaming were turned into a script . Created in France, Dove asked a group of women - all beautiful and impeccably chic - to write down every thought they had about themselves in a notebook. The beauty brand then took the notes away with them. Unbeknownst to the women, those criticisms, negative remarks and tirades of self body-shaming were turned into a script. What happened next, shocked them all. Dove recruited two undercover actresses to read the script, created using the notes each of the women made about themselves, while they were all within earshot. Their reactions were priceless . The comments featured in the actresses' scripted dialogue were harsh, cutting and bordering on bullying . Played out by two actresses, the script was read aloud as dialogue in a cafe, where the women themselves had been invited for coffee. In the experiment set up by Dove, the women heard the actresses repeat their own thoughts to each other, out loud. Making for a shocking scene, the script, which contained nothing but the original notes, was cutting to say the least. One woman felt insecure about her teeth, noting that she thought they made her look like a mouse . When the actresses repeated the insecurity out loud, while sitting on the next table, her shock was obvious . In one scenario, a customer sitting on a nearby table, not involved in the experiment, even intervenes. 'Your arms are too big, your silhouette is all squashed,' reads one remark written by a woman who looks no bigger than a size eight. 'Sit up straight otherwise your belly looks big,' the same woman continues. Several of the women's messages to themselves echo the kind of schoolyard bullying we'd all frown upon . In one scenario, a customer sitting on a nearby table, not involved in the experiment, even intervened . Several of the women's messages to themselves echo the kind of schoolyard bullying we'd all immediately frown upon. 'With your little baby teeth you look like a mouse,' says one. While another, 'your face looks like a bulldog,' when said out loud underlines the way many women effectively bully themselves every single day. Visibly shocked by the comments, the women recognise the dialogue as their own notes.'I hope my daughter never speaks to herself like that,' says one, moved to tears by the shock of the experiment . Visibly shocked by the comments, the women recognise the dialogue as their own notes. 'I hope my daughter never speaks to herself like that,' says one.

Many of the comments written in the notebooks, when said out loud, underline the way lots of women are effectively bullying themselves every single day, by focusing on their insecurities and never their beauty . If you wouldn't speak so harshly to a friend, why do it to yourself?

The charge came to light when customers sought to claim money back from travel insurers after French air-traffic strikes affected flights earlier this month. They were asked to provide an airline letter confirming the cancellation, but easyJet told its hard-hit passengers to pay a \u00a310 fee. Scroll down for video . Compensation: The charge came to light when easyJet customers sought to claim money back from travel insurers after French air-traffic strikes affected flights earlier this month. Above, file image . The Association of European Airlines confirmed last night that no other airline has attempted to charge for this and said customers should not be charged. However, a spokesman for easyJet defended the airline\u2019s position, saying: \u2018The administration charge for the letter is applied because each letter has to be individually researched and created for each passenger.\u2019 In an email seen by the Mail in response to one customer\u2019s request, easyJet\u2019s customer service team said: \u2018We can certainly send you a letter to help you claim on your insurance, that\u2019s not a problem. \u2018There is a small administration fee of 10GBP for the letter, which you should be able to claim back through your insurer.\u2019 There were delays and 1,000 flight cancellations across Europe this month following the 48-hour strike by French air-traffic controllers. EasyJet is France\u2019s second-largest airline and cancelled 588 flights over the two days. The airline launched \u2018rescue flights\u2019 to repatriate holidaymakers and children stranded abroad.

Firstly the winter weather across Europe has been worse than 2014 this particularly affected Jet2, easyJet and Monarch who suffered considerable delays on their routes to Chambery and Grenoble in France. \u2018The second cause has been the number of strikes in Europe.

        "article": "Teachers can judge the behaviour of black students more harshly than while pupils, new research has suggested. A study by researchers at Stanford University examined the reaction of secondary and primary school teachers in the United States to student race. They found that the teachers were more likely to view youngsters who they thought were black as troublemakers than those they thought were white. Teachers tend to see black pupils as more likely to cause trouble in the future if they have misbehaved in the past, according to new research that attempted to examine the impact of racial stereotypes in US schools . The researchers say this may go someway towards explaining why black children are often disciplined more at schools compared to other pupils. Professor Jennifer Eberhardt, a psychologist at Stanford University, said: 'The fact that black children are disproportionately disciplined in school is behind dispute. 'What is less clear is why. We see that stereotypes not only can be used to allow people to interpret a specific behavior in isolation, but also stereotypes can heighten our sensitivity to behavioral patterns across time. Some of the world\u2019s most troubling times, which have included periods of intense racism, have occurred during economic downturns. And now a new study has found that people really do have a tendency to become more racist during a recession. Researchers found that faces seem \u2018blacker\u2019 and have stronger racial features during an economic downturn, and this in turn increases the likelihood of discrimination. The study by New York University claims that conditions of \u2018resource scarcity\u2019 alter people\u2019s perception of race. Their work follows a study last year, which suggested racism is on the rise in the UK, fuelled by financial strife. In four experiments, involving 285 non-black Americans, scientists David Amodio and Amy Krosch found people see faces different during an economic downturn. 'This pattern sensitivity is especially relevant in the schooling context.' In their study, which is published in the journal Psychological Science, Professor Eberhardt and her colleagues presented teachers with fictional school records. These records described two instances of misbehaviour by a student. The teachers were asked about their perception of the severity, how irritated that misbehaviour would make them and how the student should be punished. They were also asked whether they saw the student as a troublemaker and if they could imagine themselves suspending that pupil in the future. The researchers randomly assigned names to the student records, in some cases suggesting the student was black with names like Deshawn or Darnell and in others suggesting they were white with names like Greg or Jake. The researchers found that racial stereotypes had little impact on the teachers' views of the pupils after one infraction. However, the second piece of misbehaviour was seen as 'more troubling' when committed by a black student rather than a white one. The researchers examined the views of both primary and secondary school teachers to see if their opinions of fictional pupils were altered by racial stereotypes and found they tended to judge black students more harshly . In the US black students are disproportionately punished for misbehaviour compared to white students . The teachers also tended to want to discipline black students more harshly as they were more likely to see the misbehaviour as part of a pattern. The race of the teachers who took part in the study was not immediately clear, but Mail Online has contacted the researchers for more information. Jason Okonofua, who also took part in the study, said the findings had implications beyond the school system. He said: 'Most social relationships entail repeated encounters. 'Interactions between police officers and civilians, between employers and employees, between prison guards and prisoners all may be subject to the sort of stereotype escalation effect we have identified in our research.' The researchers suggest that psychological interventions could be used to help change the stereotypes of black students influencing the way teachers treat pupils. In 2005 Trevor Phillips, then the chairman of the Commission For Racial Equality in the UK, suggested that black boys should be taught in separate classes in order to improve their educational achievements as a group. His controversial idea was met with opposition from some who said ghetto culture was to blame for the poor classroom performance of black boys, not just racism.",

        "article": "It is one of the most dangerous sports in the world and one in every 15 bull rides ends in an injury of some sort. But that isn't enough to stop hundreds of child riders, some as young as seven, from taking the hot seat each year. Among them is Lance Lara, 10, from Fort Worth in Texas, who has proved so successful that he was crowned world champion in his age group last year. Bouncing around: A young bull rider takes on a bullock (steer) at a rodeo in Fort Worth, Texas . But each time he gets on a bullock, a castrated male, he risks life and limb, and has already been trampled on several times. That, however, is not enough to stop his father TJ, himself a former bull rider, from entering Lance, his older brother Joe, 15, and his sister Jayden, seven, into competitions all over the US. 'It\u2019s about taking chances and these kids, that\u2019s what they\u2019re doing,' he explains in an interview with Channel 4's Unreported World. 'They\u2019re taking chances and as parents we\u2019re taking a chance. This is a very dangerous sport and you can\u2019t take it kiddish and [be] playing around because that\u2019s when you can get hurt.' Bull riding is a multi-billion dollar industry in the US and events staged by the PBR, the professional bull riders' association, are watched by up to half a billion people around the world each year. Ouch! Most bull riders are speedily thrown off - a good result is eight seconds . Hitting the deck: An estimated one in 15 bull rides across all age groups ends in injury of some sort . Starting small: The youngest children hone their skills on sheep before graduating to calves . But as the stakes get higher, pressure to breed bulls that are more athletic, more vicious and bigger than ever before has increased - including in the junior division. For Cody Custer, a former bull riding world champion, it is becoming too dangerous. 'You take a young teenage boy and put him on a bull that\u2019s got a massive pedigree,' he explains. 'It would be kind of like putting a young 13, 14 year old footballer against an NFL player. It\u2019s just not even.' Another young bull-rider, 16-year-old Trey, who has been knocked out several times by oversized bulls, agrees. 'The breeding system nowadays is getting so intense and so hard-core, it\u2019s not even realistic. 'The more stuff they breed and the more stuff they do, it\u2019s making bucking harder and harder. It\u2019s crazy.' That, however, isn't enough to quell the Lara family's enthusiasm. All three children started when they were barely more than toddlers, honing their skills on sheep in a sport known colloquially as 'mutton throwing'. Not happy: Even the calves, such as the one pictured, can pack a hefty punch if enraged . Moving on: The next step is to ride bullocks (castrated young males) before culminating in big bulls . Tough task: Bullocks, who are often approaching the size of a full-grown female, are no easy ride . Now seven, Jayden, the youngest, has graduated onto calves while Lance takes on bullocks and Joe wrangles bulls. But of all the Lara children, it is Lance who takes the sport most seriously, training for two hours a day, every day, in a bid to achieve his ambition of becoming a PBR rider. He has also suffered several injuries. 'I was hanging upside down and next thing you know I was on the ground,' he recalls. 'Stepped on.' Determined not to show his family up, the 10-year-old says he managed to hold back his tears until he left the arena. 'Most of all the things that daddy says is: don\u2019t cry in the arena,' he explains. 'I cried in the back pen.' Despite the hard work and the injuries, Lance's fledgling career has proved lucrative, with the boy earning an impressive $5,000 last year. Big guns: Teenagers begin with small bulls but, should they make professional, graduate onto big ones . Aggressive: Bulls bred for rodeo are becoming increasingly large and athletic . This money is being put towards paying for college and TJ couldn't be more proud. 'I think he feels the pressure he puts on himself,' he says. 'You know the pressure of wanting to win, wanting to be number one. I always tell him I\u2019m going to throw you to the wolves, you either come back leading the pack or you get eaten. 'He\u2019s always been one of the smaller guys. It\u2019s something to kind of motivate him, pump him up.' He does, however, worry about the increasingly large bulls involved.

The 33-year-old, who presents Speed with Guy Martin on Channel 4, wrote a review of the Vanquish Carbon Edition supercar, which costs \u00a3203,000, after test driving it on the Isle of Man's TT course. He wrote of how he pressed the accelerator 'flat to the floor' before seeing the speedometer reach 180mph as he entered the village of Sulby, which is part of the TT race and has a speed limit of 40mph. TV presenter and motorcycle racer Guy Martin, who is facing a police probe after boasting he drove an Aston Martin at 180mph in a 40mph zone during a review . In the review published in the Sunday Times Driving magazine, he wrote: 'I saw 180mph down Sulby Straight, one of the fastest sections of the course, and the car wasn't even in top gear.' He also added of how he roared around the course at 6am in the morning and that he probably completed the course only two minutes shy of the record for a car, which is 19 minutes and 26 seconds. Mr Martin also wrote: 'As soon as I passed Union Mills, on to a section with no speed limit, I thought: \u201cRight, let\u2019s have it.\u201d 'I was revving with excitement. I hadn't been trying to set a time; I just wanted to see what the car would do an a road I knew well and it was something like a 22-minute lap.'

        "article": "Students, parents and staff at a Melbourne high school are horrified after the discovery students have been drinking treated sewage water from a bubbler on campus for more than a year. In a letter sent to all parents during the school holidays, the principal of St Peter\u2019s College in Cranbourne East, Tim Hogan admitted that \u2018Class A\u2019 recycled water had been inadvertently connected to an outdoor drinking fountain. The bubbler had been dispensing recycled water for 16 months\u2013 from December 17 2013 until April 1 2015. \u2018The cross-connection came to our attention through the maintenance staff of the College on the 30th of March, 2015,\u2019 Mr Hogan wrote in the letter, issued on April 14. Unfortunately for students, \u2018Class A\u2019 recycled water is sewage that has been treated to a standard that\u2019s safe for watering gardens, washing clothes and flushing toilets. Students at Melbourne high school St Peter's College were drinking from a bubbling dispensing recycled water for more than a year . Although it is the highest quality of recycled water, the water that the students had been consuming is not considered acceptable for consumption. Whilst drinking the water, the students would have been at a greater risk of contracting gastroenteritis or diarrhoea due to the possible presence of a parasite, Cryptosporidium. An investigation has been launched by the Department of Health and Human Services to assess the extent of the possible health impact on the students. The principal assured students, parents and staff that the drinking fountain was shut down on April 1 and is no longer in use. The other 20 bubblers at the school have been tested and none show traces of recycled water. The ongoing investigation will determine the number of students who have drunk from the water foundation since it became contaminated. Although it is the highest quality of recycled water, the water that the students had been consuming is not considered acceptable for consumption . \u2018The Department has advised that drinking the Class A recycled water may have led to a slightly increased risk of gastro,\u2019 the principal warned. However, preliminary testing of the chemicals present in the drinking water from the bubbler found that \u2018the vast majority were at very low concentrations\u2019, meaning the student were unlikely to have been harmed from consuming the water. Daily Mail Australia spoke with a number of parents of St Peter's students. All the parents were unaware of any cases of gastro or anyone who believed they'd been adversely affected by the bubbler. A Health Department official will be on site at the school on Thursday April 16 to respond to concerns the parents may have. \u2018If anyone is suffering from a gastrointestinal illness and experiencing symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pain, they should seek advice from their GP,\u2019 Mr Hogan advised. Families and staff are being encouraged to contact the Department of Health & Human Services on 1300 761 874. Whilst drinking the water, the students would have been at a greater risk of contracting gastroenteritis or diarrhoea due to the possible presence of a parasite, Cryptosporidium .",

At the launch of their manifesto today, the Liberal Democrats will vow to protect the entire education budget in the next parliament \u2018from cradle to college\u2019. Unlike Tory and Labour plans, spending would rise per pupil \u2013 with an extra 460,000 schoolchildren expected in the next five years \u2013 and also in line with inflation from 2018. Scroll down for video . Nick Clegg (left)\u00a0will today promise the highest education spending of any party with a \u00a35billion flagship offer to undecided voters. His wife Miriam is pictured in Marple, Greater Manchester yesterday . It is understood that Mr Clegg will say this is a deal-breaker in any future coalition talks after May 7, in order to win over \u2018centre-ground\u2019 Conservative voters worried about funding cuts for schools. Education is a sore point for many who backed the Lib Dems in 2010 on the promise that the party would scrap tuition fees and then saw them trebled to \u00a39,000 per year. But Mr Clegg will claim the Lib Dems are now \u2018the party of education\u2019 and the school funding commitment is firm because it will be on the front page of today\u2019s manifesto of pledges. The tuition fees pledge was not on the front page in 2010, and the Lib Dem leader said those which were, such as increasing the income tax allowance, he had stuck \u2018doggedly, religiously\u2019 to. Protecting the education budget in real terms for children aged two to 19, will cost an additional \u00a35billion a year more than the Conservatives plan to spend, and \u00a32.5billion a year more than Labour. It would kick in from 2018-19, after the deficit has been cleared under Lib Dem plans and be funded by the proceeds of economic growth. Mr Clegg will claim the Lib Dems are now \u2018the party of education\u2019 and the school funding commitment is firm because it will be on the front page of today\u2019s manifesto of pledges . In a pitch to Tory voters in battleground areas such as the South West, Mr Clegg will say people \u2018are right to distrust the Conservatives on education\u2019. \u2018Our manifesto has one simple ambition and word at its heart, opportunity\u2019, he said last night. \u2018It\u2019s the very old liberal idea that every should be able to live out their life to the full regardless of the circumstances of the circumstances of their birth, of the income of his or her parents or where they come from. \u2018Education is the great liberator of people\u2019s potential so we need to make sure we support the education system in the next Parliament. \u2018The great challenge is we have more and more young people coming into our education system, so we need to make sure that the money is there to educate every single pupil even as their numbers increase. \u2018We are determined to make sure that every child in Britain has a world class education.\u2019 The money would be spent on qualified teachers in every classroom, training more teachers, more classes in small groups or one to one and expanding early years education. Speaking on the campaign trail in Lewes in East Sussex, Mr Clegg said he had noticed voters in seats fought between the Tories and Lib Dems were expressing concern about spending on public services. The Tories have matched Lib Dem plans to offer \u00a38billion a year in extra health spending to meet a request from the head of NHS England. By Jack Doyle, Political Correspondent for the Daily Mail . The Green Party would abolish new road building and increase public spending by a fifth to pay for a vast wish-list of commitments, its manifesto revealed yesterday. Leader Natalie Bennett pledged to raise tens of billions in new taxes, including a wealth tax, a 60p higher rate of income tax and imposing VAT and fuel duty on aviation. Launching the 84-page manifesto in trendy Dalston, East London, she said it amounted to a \u2018peaceful political revolution\u2019. Proposed policies include protections for the \u2018nomadic lifestyle\u2019, a promise to \u2018ensure respect for everyone\u2019, and adopting an approach of \u2018defensive defence\u2019 while abolishing the Trident nuclear deterrent. The age of criminal responsibility would be raised from ten to 14, cannabis and other drugs legalised, and there would be an amnesty for illegal immigrants here for three years or more. Leader Natalie Bennett pledged to raise tens of billions in new taxes, including a wealth tax, a 60p higher rate of income tax and imposing VAT and fuel duty on aviation . But questions were raised over whether the hikes in taxes on the richest would raise anything like the billions promised. Even manifesto author Brian Heatley admitted the plans were based on \u2018a lot of estimation and judgment\u2019. The proposals would see public spending go up by \u00a3177billion a year by the end of the Parliament. A new tax would charge anyone with \u00a33million 2 per cent of their wealth, and top earners would pay 60p in the pound. Corporation tax would go up to 30 per cent from 20 per cent, the fuel duty escalator would be restored and capital gains tax allowances abolished. The party promises to scrap the \u00a315billion major roads spending programme, bring in a \u2018Citizen\u2019s Pension\u2019 of \u00a3180 a week for single OAPs and \u00a3310 for a couple, and hugely increase spending on health, social care and social housing. Foreign aid spending would rise by another \u00a36billion a year, child benefit would double, tuition fees would be abolished and pupils would get organic school dinners. Other policies include a promise to end the use of nuclear and coal power stations and ban fracking. Railways would be renationalised, there would be a ban on fur imports, and cages for rabbits and hens in farming would be outlawed.",

The man, who is seen unsteady on his feet and swaying after the day at the races in Aintree, barges into the 63-year-old who then stumbles backwards and falls to the floor in the middle of the road. The 34-year-old man, dressed in a suit, then walks off as people gasp and try to help the victim who was left lying on the floor. Scroll down for video . An Aintree racegoer is seen staggering towards an elderly man, before he barges into him and knocks him onto the floor into a road, leaving the man injured and lying on the floor as he walks off . He was later taken to hospital and treated for bruising on his face. Merseyside Police said the 34-year-old from Formby in Sefton came forward to police late last night and he was interviewed under caution about the alleged assault. He was released this morning pending further inquiries. The man was named on social media as a manager called Terry. Philip Dears, who took the video, posted on Facebook today: 'I have a 2 minute long video of my mate Terry drunk walking home from the races on Thursday, during which he staggers and accidentally bumps into an old man. The man falls and I'm filming the whole situation trying not to laugh. 'When I realise the seriousness of the situation the phone goes off, the laughing stops and I check on the old man, he is hurt on the floor but is being seen to by stewards awaiting medical attention. I turned my attention to Terry and wanted to make sure he gets home safety.' In the post Mr Dears said he and his wife phoned the hospital to check on the elderly man's condition. He also claims the video, which appears on YouTube, has been edited to make it appear the old man was deliberately targeted when this was not the case. The man stumbles backwards and falls, as the video is filmed by a sniggering friend of the alleged perpetrator . He added: 'When you see the video you will see this is a total accidental collision, it's important people get this truth because a lot of people are very upset and I can see why because it looks like a malicious, cowardly attack but this is far from the reality of the situation. ' The footage was brought to the attention of officers by members of the public who had shared it online. Police established the mobile phone footage, shot by a friend of the 34-year-old, was taken outside the racecourse on Thursday evening at about 7pm. He shouts to him 'text bomb' and 'is there any need?' moments before the incident happens as he sniggers uncontrollably from behind his phone. In the video, onlookers can be heard gasping in shock and seen rushing to the man's aid before calling for an ambulance. Officers said the man who was knocked to the floor is from Skelmersdale in West Lancashire. People have expressed their shock at the video. The 63-year-old man is seen standing on the pavement before the other man barges into him and knocks him . He becomes unsteady on his feet from the impact and begins to stumble, before he tumbles backwards . Gasps can be heard on the mobile phone footage as members of the public rush to help the injured man . Paul Hardman wrote: 'That video of the old man at Aintree\u00a0makes me sick to the stomach. Some absolute scum in this world.' Others labelled his behaviour 'disgusting' and 'vile.' Hayley Wills added: 'Hope that horrible man that knocked over the old chap at Aintree gets what he deserves, as well as the sick person that filmed it.' Merseyside Police earlier thanked visitors for making the annual race 'such a safe and enjoyable occasion' and said no arrests were made inside the ground over the three days. An online crowdfunding page has been set up to help the injured man.Concerned wellwishers have already raised \u00a3345 to help the pensioner with his recovery after Joanne Dickson saw Gary's response and launched the fundraising campaign. Page owner Joanne said: 'Most of us tonight have watched the horrible video of the gentleman being knocked to the ground. 'I'm hoping we can raise enough to maybe help him replace his teeth and his phone. 'I don't know the gentleman, I would just like him to know that most decent people are disgusted that, even if the knock was an accident, that no remorse was shown.'",

Confessing himself as a 'chief witness' of football it's no surprise, then, that when asked to pick a favourite he is able to pluck one game in particular from his encyclopaedic memory. 'I've been very lucky to cover so many great games but I do usually plump for this same one,' Tyler reminisced with Sky Sports. 'Liverpool 4, Newcastle 3.' Stan Collymore (third left) smashes home Liverpool's fourth past Newcastle goalkeeper Pavel Srnicek . He is of course referring to the seven goal thriller at Anfield on April , 1996, which saw the two Premier League hopefuls slug it out in order to close the gap between themselves and leaders Manchester United. 'Everybody remembers Newcastle going for [the league title] but Liverpool were in the mix as well; and maybe they looked too much at each other because neither of them won it in the end.' Despite Sir Alex Ferguson's Manchester United finishing top of the pile at the end of the season, the game still firmly holds a place in Tyler's personal archive. Robbie Fowler (second right) rises above John Beresford to head home the opener for Liverpool . Fowler's early goal began the seven goal spectacle that Martin Tyler classed as his favourite game . David Ginola (right) keeps calm under the pressure of Jason McAteer to slot home Newcastle's second . Les Ferdinand (left) scored the Magpies' first goal and congratulates Ginola after putting them ahead . 'I think if you take all the elements of why we all love football they all happened in this particular game.' With Liverpool's potent striker Robbie Fowler breaking the deadlock on the bobbly Anfield pitch after just two minutes, the outlook looked bleak for Newcastle that evening. However, when Magpies striker Les Ferdinand levelled on ten minutes it began a ferocious exchange between the two sides that few could forget. Strikes from Newcastle's David Ginola and Faustino Asprilla either side of another from Fowler continued the goalfest and when Liverpool's Stan Collymore drew both sides level with just over 20 minutes remaining the game was balanced on a knife edge. Faustino Asprilla (left) salutes the crowd after scoring Newcastle's third in the classic match at Anfield . Stan Collymore (second right) is mobbed by his team-mates after all but sealing the win for the home side . Collymore celebrates the win after scoring twice against Newcastle on that memorable afternoon . In the dying embers of the match, Collymore latched on to a ball from John Barnes two minutes into injury time to score the seventh goal of the game; and Tyler still remembers the moment the Kop went wild. 'I get goosebumps every time I hear it because it was such a special time. 'Poor Kevin Keegan slumped over the advertising hoardings at the end is one of the iconic shots of the game, perhaps the iconic shot. 'Whatever makes us so addicted to football it was the drug.'",

Taken somewhere in the forests of north-eastern Nigeria, the images show the jihadis casually posing in front of the terror group's sinister black and white flag while brandishing assault rifles. The slick photographs carry all the logos and artwork typically seen in official ISIS releases, suggesting the Middle East-based militants have taken full control of Boko Haram propaganda. The release came as Nigerian soldiers backed by warplanes invaded the Islamist's final stronghold in the country - the Sambisa forest - in an effort to finally defeat the six-year-old insurgency. Legion of death: Taken somewhere in the forests of north eastern Nigeria, the images show the Boko Haram jihadis casually posing with assault rifles . Pledged allegiance: A Boko Haram militant\u00a0casually poses in front of the Islamic State terror group's sinister black and white flag while brandishing an assault rifle . Over the last six years, Boko Haram have killed thousands and kidnapped hundreds in a battle to establish an Islamic caliphate in Nigeria. Earlier this year the group's leader, Abubakar Shekau, released a video saying the group had pledged allegiance to ISIS and would be dropping the name Boko Haram. Instead they now refer to themselves as Wilayat al Sudan al Gharbi, which is commonly translated into English as the 'West African Province' of the Islamic State. Since their ISIS allegiance video earlier in the year, Boko Haram has not released any official propaganda photographs or video footage. Typically ISIS and their affiliates release shocking images of mass executions or the brutal enforcement of Sharia law after similar periods of silence. The fact Boko Haram have returned with little more than a series of group shots and pastoral scenes is perhaps symptomatic of the group's rapid decline in influence over the past months. Influence: The slick photographs carry all the logos and artwork typically seen in official ISIS releases, suggesting the Middle East-based militants have taken full control of Boko Haram propaganda . Preparing for war: The fact Boko Haram have returned with little more than a series of group shots with amateur weapons is perhaps symptomatic of the group's rapid decline in influence over the past months . This morning Nigerian soldiers retreated from Boko Haram's last known stronghold in the country amid concerns the militants had\u00a0booby-trapped the area before fleeing. Three pro-government vigilantes were killed in the area by a landmine this morning. A vigilante and a security source both confirmed the pullback from the Sambisa forest, a day after an offensive aimed at rooting out the insurgents. A spokesman for the military was not immediately available for comment. 'The soldiers have retreated to Bama because of mines. They had been on the road but that made them vulnerable, so they moved to the bush but there are mines planted there (too),' one soldier, who did not want to be named, revealed. The Sambisa forest, a former colonial game reserve, is about 60 miles from the village of Chibok, from where Boko Haram abducted more than 200 secondary school girls a year ago. 'Three of our boys were killed by a landmine as we progressed into Sambisa. We've suspended going farther,' Muhammad Mungonu, a member of a pro-government vigilante, told Reuters. Boko Haram - which means 'Western education is sinful' - forced the girls to convert to Islam and marry . Horrified: Michelle Obama, holds a piece of paper with the simple message #BringBackOurGirls following Boko Haram's kidnapping of\u00a0more than 200 secondary school girls in Chibok, Nigeria last year . Protestors marched through Abuja with red tape over their mouths, carrying a poster with pictures of some of the missing girls. It is now a year since more than 200 schoolgirls were kidnapped by Boko Haram militants . Muhammadu Buhari said his government will do 'everything in their power' to find and return around 220 missing schoolgirls to their families, as young girl joins the rally outside the Nigerian ministry of education . Intelligence officials believed the girls kidnapped in Chibok are being held in the Sambisa forest, but U.S. reconnaissance drones have so far failed to locate them. Boko Haram controlled an area the size of Belgium at the start of the year, but have since lost much of that ground after a concerted push by militaries from Nigeria and neighbours Chad, Niger and Cameroon in the past two months. Yet they remain a deadly threat to civilians, as illustrated on Friday when they slit the throats of 12 people in northeast Nigeria as the army was trying to evacuate the area around the former Boko Haram headquarters of Gwoza. Failure to crush Boko Haram or protect civilians was one reason President Goodluck Jonathan lost an election on March 28 to Muhammadu Buhari, who has pledged to spare no effort in battling the militants after he is sworn in on May 29. Chadian military source said a joint military operation involving armies from Niger and Cameroon was expected to begin to encircle the Sambisa forest next week. Chadians will go in from the Cameroonian border where they have been massing troops.",

After teasing fans with some pre-release pieces, the Big Brother star and glamour model has unveiled her collection with Honeyz.com in full. Casey's new line is full of boho frocks, paisley prints and flowing maxi dresses perfect for the summer season. Scroll down for video . Big Brother star and glamour model Casey Batchelor has unveiled her summer collection with Honeyz.com in full - and models all of the clothes herself, of course . Speaking about her new drop, which was inspired by the seventies influence spotted on the SS15 catwalks, Casey told FEMAIL: 'I'm very excited about the launch of my first range. Every girl has a clothes obsession - and I am to the extreme!'. 'I have so many clothes it's ridiculous but looking good and feeling good in our clothes is a big deal. Wearing the right clothes can make you go from feeling just OK to feeling great, which was the feeling behind my collection.' Casey, who has her own  walk-in-wardrobe at home, says that launching her own range of clothes and accessories is a 'dream come true'. Casey teased her fans with some pre-release pieces and now she's released the collection with Honeyz.com in all its glory . The glamour model's new drop was inspired by the seventies influence spotted on the SS15 catwalks . Casey has also designed accessories to complement her outfits, which she says is a 'dream come true' The reality TV star, who recently appeared on Celebrity Dinner Date, made sure to include lots of mix-and-match pieces in the range to ensure her fans could shake up their style depending on their mood. 'It's always good to have a variety of styles and and looks to hand,' she said. 'But remember to always keep it classy!'. Casey certainly shows her fans how to work the looks - and showcases her trim figure in the campaign shots. 'My figure has changed since I've had my breast reduction,' she explained. 'It's allowed me to wear different types of clothing, which has been really nice to experiment with different styles. 'Before I would always have to wear a bra, whereas now I can get away with not wearing one with certain items. Also having smaller boobs doesn't make me so top heavy anymore, which is more flattering in clothes.' Casey shows her fans how to work the looks - and showcases her trim figure in the campaign shots . Casey loved creating her own fashion range so much that she already has her sights set on designing a shoe collection. 'Shoes are my weakness,' she said.

I am definitely a shoe-a-holic.' The star isn't limited to just fashion design and has been busy shooting a film called Bonded By Blood, which is out later this year. 'I'm very excited for you all to see this because people don't know that I am a trained actress. This is going to be a great way for people to see me in a different light as it's a very serious role - it's actually based on a true story,' she said.

        "article": "In the search for meaning and importance, the FA Cup might have found its saviour. Enter Liverpool and Brendan Rodgers, a club and manager not just popping into the party to say a polite hello and a quick goodbye. Tonight, against Blackburn at Ewood Park, Rodgers faces one of those defining moments in a season that has not lacked them. His only hope must be that this time it doesn't go so horribly wrong. So far it has been a theme of the campaign that when the need was greatest, so too have been the disappointments. He loaded for duck on a bear hunt in the Champions League against Real Madrid and lost. He wanted to save his best resources for Chelsea and lost that game, too. Kolo Toure found the net in Liverpool's FA Cup clash with Blackburn but his effort was ruled out . Blackburn salute their fans at Anfield after earning a Sixth Round replay at home to the Premier League side . When the European portion of their season fizzled out, first in the big show and then in the Europa League, the Premier League offered an opportunity. Getting into the top-four without Luis Suarez and often in the absence of Daniel Sturridge would be an immense achievement. Having started the season so badly and recovered so impressively, it became a real possibility. Then two huge games - Manchester United and Arsenal. A chance. Steven Gerrard lost his mind, the defence lost the plot and Liverpool lost by a combined total of 6-2 across the two games. A top-four place is virtually gone, unless anyone can conceivably see them making up seven points and a massive goal difference on Manchester City. Suddenly, the romance of the FA Cup is a little more two-sided. They need it badly. Steven Gerrard's birthday falls on May 30, the same day as the FA Cup final at Wembley . The FA Cup represents Liverpool's last chance of silverware after a disappointing season . 'I don't want to go down the route of saying that it saves our season,' said Rodgers before the replay of their quarter-final against Blackburn. 'Our objective at the start, though, was to win a trophy. 'So I think if we didn't get in the top four and we didn't have a trophy this year, we would be disappointed. I think certainly the FA Cup would give us a great boost as a team with lots of young players and players coming into the club. 'That's the expectancy we want. We want to be able to be challenging every year. 'That was the key thing for me, to get the group challenging at the top end of the league and for trophies. The FA Cup would mark a good step forward for us.' The need for trophies has been a dominant theme since Rodgers took over at Liverpool and made them contenders again. There is no denying the steps he has taken with the club and very little to suggest he is anything other than one of the sharpest managerial minds working in this country. Daniel Sturridge will be crucial to Liverpool's chances of reaching the FA Cup semi-final . Glen Johnson is in good spirits in training ahead of Liverpool's trip to Ewood Park on Wednesday . But how he will be tested if this season ends without either a top-four place or a trophy. Raheem Sterling rather helpfully alluded to the need for the latter recently. That tricky contract situation has not gone away and it is less likely to have a happy ending for Liverpool if they can't present a silver argument to Sterling in the summer. The same goes for potential new arrivals. Rodgers can talk magnificently and persuasively but his sales pitches to leading players would be enhanced immeasurably if he could talk about current achievements. Something shiny and tangible and recently acquired would help. It's a tough ask. They face Blackburn with a defence looking as woefully shaky as it did at the start of the season. Without Martin Skrtel and Emre Can tonight that defence could be vulnerable again. Steven Gerrard is also missing. Not ideal, though not necessarily a tremendous setback against a Championship side. In any case, Liverpool and Rodgers need to find a way through. It has been three years since they last won a trophy \u2013 under Kenny Dalglish - and the FA Cup is a chance to stop the clock. It's a defining moment that must not end in another failure. Liverpool have not won a trophy since they beat Cardiff to win the Carling Cup three years ago . Real Madrid 1-0 Liverpool, November 4 . Finally back on the grandest stage, but Rodgers opted for a watered down XI. Dejan Lovren, Steven Gerrard, Raheem Stirling, Jordan Henderson, Philippe Coutinho and Mario Balotelli played all previous Champions League matches but none of them started. The aim, it appeared, was to prioritise the following league game. Karim Benzema celebrates scoring for Real Madrid against Liverpool at the Bernabeu . Liverpool 1-2 Chelsea, November 8 . It was time to vindicate the gamble in Madrid, which was widely criticised. Rodgers made seven changes to the side that lost in the Champions League and Emre Can put them ahead. But Chelsea won 2-1, leaving Liverpool eighth in the Premier League. Having rested a host of players in Madrid, Brendan Rodgers' side then lost a crunch league game to Chelsea . Chelsea 1-0 Liverpool, January 27 . After drawing the first leg of their Capital One Cup semi-final, Liverpool blew a host of chances and fell to a stoppage-time winner. A big opportunity missed. The Stamford Bridge also knocked Liverpool out of the Capital One Cup following a 1-0 win at home . Besiktas 1-0 Liverpool, February 26 . Ten years after their Champions League miracle in Istanbul, Liverpool returned to face Besiktas in the Europa League last 32. They held a 1-0 first-leg lead. It went horribly wrong and they lost on penalties. 'Unfortunately, on this occasion, Istanbul is not a happy place,' said Rodgers . Demba Ba celebrates after Dejan Lovren missed the crucial penalty in the shoot-out against Besiktas . Arsenal 4-1 Liverpool, April 4 . Liverpool's last real shot at getting into the top four and it fell apart spectacularly. Raheem Sterling's unauthorised interview hardly helped matters in the build-up and the game was a disaster. They were 3-0 down at half-time and ultimately repeated the kind of defensive inadequacies that hurt them earlier in the campaign. A huge anti-climax. Mesut Ozil curls home Arsenal's second in their 4-1 win over Liverpool in the Premier League last weekend .",

The revelation follows widespread public anger at Indonesia's executions of Australian nationals Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan despite the pleas of the Federal government. It also comes as one of the few Australians known to be facing death row in China - Sydney man Peter Gardner - had his case pushed forward by six months. 'The number and seriousness of current cases of Australians potentially facing the death penalty in China is unprecedented,' said the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade document, which was dated December 2, 2014. Chinese authorities have said that eleven Australians were apprehended on suspected drug smuggling charges in Guangzhou alone in 2014 - a crime punishable by death. Scroll down for video . Australian citizen Ibrahim Jalloh (pictured) is reportedly facing drugs charges in Guangzhou province . Peter Gardner (left) and Kalynda Davis (right) were apprehended in Guangzhou. Davis was allowed to go free when charges were withdrawn but Gardner's case has been brought forward by six months . Jockey Anthony Roger Bannister (pictured) was charged with importing 3kg of methamphetamine . The exact number facing possible death sentences was redacted in the briefing, obtained under freedom of information laws, which added: 'None of those detained was born in China or is a former Chinese national. 'All were arrested for drug-related offences'. The document said consular assistance was provided to the Australians, including monitoring developments, prisoner welfare visits, and keeping in contact with family or nominated contacts. Other possible steps appeared to be redacted. Chinese prosecutors are reportedly seeking the death penalty against jockey Anthony Roger Bannister, 43, from Adelaide, who was charged with allegedly attempting to smuggle 3kg of methamphetamine from Guangzhou to Australia. Another citizen, Ibrahim Jalloh and his friend Bengali Sherrif were arrested at Guangzhou Airport in July over alleged drug crimes. Sherrif is reported to have been granted a suspended death sentence and Jalloh has not yet faced trial, according to the ABC.\u00a0Other names have not been released. Do you know more? Daniel.Piotrowski@mailonline.com . Drug ring? Many of those facing death row were trying to import or export the drug 'ice' into or out of Guangzhou. Pictured above is Guangzhou International Airport . The confidential DFAT briefing concerned Gardner and his then-girlfriend, Penrith woman Kalynda Davis. Ms Davis was freed without charge following a traumatic month in a Chinese prison last year where she was forced to crop her hair short. The pair had met on Tinder. Ms Davis's friends realised something was wrong when she failed to appear as a bridesmaid at a friend's wedding in early November. The file also revealed the importance the government placed in not speaking publicly about her case at the time of her imprisonment. 'Given the timing of the investigative period and the possible death penalty involved,' DFAT asked that 'no information about this case be disclosed.' Authorities alleged Gardner tried to smuggle 30kg of methamphetamine out of China to Australia. When Ms Davis returned to Sydney, her father revealed she was cleared by Chinese authorities because she had carry-on luggage only . Rose Kulak, death penalty campaigner for Amnesty International, told Daily Mail Australia: 'China executes more people than the rest of the world combined.' 'With a 99 per cent conviction rate in China, once you are sentences to death, it is a very precarious situation you are in,' Ms Kulak said. Approximately 8 per cent of all recorded executions in China last year were carried out for drug-related crimes, Amnesty said. The Gardner family has requested privacy and won't comment to the media while the case proceeds. A spokeswoman for the Foreign Minister was approached for comment but was unavailable to respond by Daily Mail Australia's deadline. A spokesman for Opposition foreign affairs spokeswoman Tanya Plibersek said Australia should lead efforts against the death penalty, 'in particular working with the United Nations'.

        "article": "A sheep farmer has won an apology from supermarket giant Asda after a leg of lamb she bought from them labelled as British turned out to be imported from the other side of the world. Sue Sharp was shocked to find a stamp on the \u00a311 joint saying it had come from New Zealand despite Asda's packaging claiming it was born, reared and slaughtered in the UK. Mrs Sharp, who runs a 1,600-acre sheep farm with her husband Robert, had purposely sought out British produce in support of her fellow farmers. Misleading: The leg of lamb Sue Sharp bought from Asda in Midlothian, Scotland, claims on the packaging that it is from the UK. But a stamp on the meat (pictured) is from the New Zealand health inspector . But she was horrified when she got home and found the 'home-grown' leg of lamb had actually been flown halfway round the world to the store in Midlothian, Scotland. Asda said the mislabelled lamb was a one-off and that the gaffe was the result of human error. But Mrs Sharp has questioned the claim and is now warning other shoppers to be extra vigilant when choosing their joints of meat. The label on the Asda Butcher's Selection leg states it is 'Born in the UK. Reared in the UK. Slaughtered in the UK. Cut in the UK' but a stamp branded onto the animal's skin carries the stamp of the New Zealand health inspector. The error has been called 'unacceptable' by farming unions who are now demanding to meet with bosses at the supermarket chain to discuss their future plans for selling British lamb. Asda says it has carried out an investigation into the mistake which revealed Mrs Sharp's leg of lamb was the only one mislabelled at the Galashiels store she shopped at. Sue Sharp, 57, has refused to accept Asda's explanation that the mistake was a one-off . Mrs Sharp, 57, whose farm has 1,300 sheep, said: 'As a sheep farmer I'm very interested in making sure I buy British meat. 'The lamb I bought from Asda was clearly labelled UK born, UK raised, UK slaughtered. 'It wasn't until I got home and looked at it more closely that I realised the stamp actually on the meat itself said New Zealand. 'It was a bit of a shock and something I feel rather strongly about as a sheep farmer - the last thing I want to do is buy New Zealand lamb. 'I was completely baffled so I wrote to Asda and they came back apologising but saying it was an isolated incident. 'I just don't believe that. I'm sure it was a mistake but I bet there were more, I can't see how just one could have been wrongly labelled.' She added: 'They've held their hands up but is that enough? A big company like Asda should have procedures in place to make that sort of error pretty much impossible to make. 'As farmers we have to deal with traceability. The form-filling is really onerous, and that needs to apply right the way through the chain. 'We are doing our part so you would have thought big companies should be able to do their part. 'I think British meat is a better product, it tastes better, but it's also much better for the environment than shipping it round the world. You couldn't get much farther away than New Zealand.' Mrs Sharp has now advised other people to check their meat thoroughly to make sure it is from where it says it is. John Armour from NFU Scotland said: 'For a sheep farmer like Mrs Sharp to have bought a product she thought would support her fellow British farmers only to discover that it was imported is unacceptable and Asda has acknowledged that. An Asda spokesman said: 'This was an isolated incident where a leg of lamb was accidentally mislabelled' It is estimated that more than 70 per cent of the New Zealand lamb sold in Britain comes from halal slaughterhouses without the fact being declared on the label. All the slaughtermen in these establishments must be Muslim and say a prayer when making the cut across the animal\u2019s throat which kills it. The New Zealand meat industry has taken the step to ensure its lamb can be sold in Muslim markets round the world. In conventional slaughterhouses, animals are stunned before they are killed by having their throats cut. However, in most Muslim countries, halal means the animals must not be stunned first. 'Asda's planned review of practices at the Galashiels store is a sensible step and it would be prudent for guidance to be re-issued to its suppliers and all Asda stores across the country to avoid fresh meat being incorrectly labelled in the future. 'Shoppers who want to support British farmers need to be able to trust the labels used in every supermarket.' He added: 'Thankfully incidents of this kind are rare but the vigilance of Mrs Sharp has provided an excellent reminder to all retailers of the need for best practice and accurate labelling at all times. 'If it says Scottish or British on the label, it must be Scottish or British in the packet.' An Asda spokesman said: 'This was an isolated incident where a leg of lamb was accidentally mislabelled. 'We pride ourselves on product traceability and transparency and are committed to sourcing British products first when in season. 'This was a genuine colleague error for which we apologise and was not meant to mislead any of our customers in any way. 'We've briefed our colleagues at the Galashiels store to make sure this doesn't happen again.'",

Now experts fear millions of them could be heading for Britain\u00a0\u2013 and the threats they pose are to be discussed at a summit meeting by beekeepers. This is because the two-inch-long Asian hornets pose a terrible danger to our honeybees. They pick off bees as they leave their hive until the colony is so exhausted the hornets can move in and ransack it. Scroll down for video . Sting in the tail? Experts fear millions of two-inch-long Asian hornets (above) could be heading to Britain after leaving six people dead and terrorising wildlife in France . The hornet is thought to have travelled to France on some Chinese pot plants in 2004. It has colonised huge swathes of the country and, with a few hornets capable of destroying 30,000 bees in just a couple of hours, honey production has plummeted. The Norfolk Beekeepers' Association will hold its Bee Health Seminar at Easton and Otley College on May 23, organised in conjunction with the National Bee Unit, which delivers the Bee Health Programmes on behalf of Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). Topics under discussion will also highly infectious diseases which threaten bee colonies such as European and American foulbrood. Carolyne Liston, chairman of the Norfolk Beekeepers' Association, warned Asian hornets are a 'very, very aggressive predator' and said they could 'come here on the wind'. She said: 'They can absolutely decimate colonies and we are concerned that it is going to come in on someone's caravan who has been travelling in France.' UK beekeepers have been sent email alerts by Defra asking them to be on the look-out for the menaces. Danger: The threats posed by Asian hornets are to be discussed at a summit meeting by beekeepers, while\u00a0UK beekeepers have been sent email alerts by Defra asking them to be on the look-out . The Asian hornet can measure up to  2in long with a 3in wingspan\u00a0\u2013\u00a0slightly smaller than the European hornet but much more aggressive. One Asian hornet can kill 40 bees in a minute, while a handful can destroy a hive of 30,000 bees in a couple of hours. They build rugby ball-shaped nests in trees, housing some 500 hornets. They scare off intruders by sending a lone worker hornet to 'warn' them\u00a0\u2013 if that fails, the workers attack en masse. Worker hornets have lifespans of 30-55 days. Asian hornets have a black head with an orange-yellow face and bright yellow leg tips, while the European hornet has a copper coloured head with a bright-yellow face and entirely reddish-brown legs. They have been urged not to approach nests, which they say hornets make in tall trees or in garages and sheds. If Asian hornets are spotted here, the National Bee Unit will send out experts from the Animal Health Veterinary Laboratories Agency to kill them using special chemicals. Ministers drew up battle plans in case killer Asian hornets are discovered in Britain last year. A law announced in the Queen's Speech gave officials powers to enter private land and destroy new invasive species within days. Groups of Asian hornets hover in front of a beehive, picking off single honeybees, decapitating them and stripping off their wings and legs before making off with the 'meat ball' to feed their young. In Asia, honeybees have learned to encircle an intruder hornet and, by flapping their wings, cause it to overheat and die. But the French bees have not had enough time to evolve an effective tactic. The hornet sting can be extremely painful to humans but, like bee stings, it is likely to kill only if the victim has a severe allergic reaction. The victims in France died from anaphylactic shock after being stung. Last night, a Defra spokesman confirmed there had been no sightings of Asian hornets in the UK so far.",

Wendell Steiner, his wife, and their four children were stopped by police in Akron, Ohio during their 300-mile journey from Nova, Ohio to Pennsylvania. Although Mitt Romney was governor of Massachusetts and not the Buckeye State, the former presidential candidate famously came under fire during his 2012 run for the White House after it was revealed he once drove for 12 hours with his Irish Setter Seamus on top of his car in a carrier. Scroll down for video . Four very terrified puppies strapped in a cage to the roof of a van moving on the freeway were rescued after dozens of concerned drivers called 911 and police pulled over the car . Wendell Steiner, his wife, and their four children were stopped by police in Akron, Ohio during their 300-mile journey from Nova, Ohio to Pennsylvania . Mitt Romney (left)  came under fire when it was revealed he once drove for 12 hours with his dog on his car . Steiner's mixed-breed puppies were wind-battered and huddled together in the cage when they were rescued, but had no injuries, according to Sgt. Kris Beitzel. 'I didn't see any injuries. They would not leave each other,' she told WKYC. 'They had urinated all over the inside of the cage. When I tried to get them out, they were trying to crawl back in.' The cage was covered on three sides with a blanket but its rear was left exposed. Beitzel said that when she asked the father why the dogs were not riding in the car as well, he responded that there wasn't room because he had 'far more important things to put in the car, meaning his children'. Steiner told police the puppies belong to his father, according to the Akron Beacon Journal. He said they were transporting the dogs to his wife's family in Pennsylvania because his father could no longer keep them. Akron Police Sgt Kris Beitzel (left) tended to the four dogs in the cage while the two sisters closely kept watch . Beitzel said the Mennonite family 'had no idea what they were doing was wrong'. 'They couldn't understand what all the tension was about,' she told Buzzfeed. 'In that culture they just look at puppies as livestock. They don't look at them as pets the way we do.' The family, who said they had no idea it was illegal to transport animals on top of a moving vehicle, were let go with a warning. 'If I had known, I'd never agree to it,' Steiner told the Akon Beacon Journal. 'I would have kept them in Nova.' The family handed the puppies over to the police, and Beitzel said she believes the 'traumatized' puppies will come around 'with a little love and attention'. He said they were transporting the dogs to his wife's family in Pennsylvania because his father could no longer keep them . During the lead up to the election, a Dogs Against Romney Facebook group was created and he was mocked . The mixed-breed puppies were wind-battered and huddled together in the cage when they were rescued, but had no injuries . The puppies were taken to a local veterinarian hospital to be examined and will be placed with the Human Society of Great Akron to be put up for adoption. Romney's revelation about his 1983 vacation was an issue during his 2008 presidential campaign as well, but it was a much bigger issue for him in 2012. During the lead up to the election, a\u00a0Dogs Against Romney Facebook group was created, 'Dogs Aren't Luggage' T-shirts were sold and Romney was lampooned by late-night hosts about the story on a nightly basis. Democratic strategist Chris Lehane told the Washington Post in 2012: '\u201cIt\u2019s a signifier. 'There are certain events that happen over the course of someone\u2019s life that play into a larger story line and feed into a caricature. 'Seamus the dog story just plays into a negative story line about a guy who you may not completely trust.\u201d Akron police didn't charge Steiner, but they did educate him about the proper transportation of animals .

Stubbs is currently embroiled in a tough promotion battle with the Easter Road side, but is believed to be among Wigan's top targets as they battle to avoid relegation from the Championship \u2014 they are currently second bottom. Stubbs' No2, John Doolan, formed part of Uwe Rosler's backroom staff at the DW Stadium before the German was sacked in November. Hibs boss Alan Stubbs has emerged as a candidate to succeed Malky Mackay after he was sacked by Wigan . Malky Mackay was sensationally sacked by Wigan Athletic following a dismal run of results since November . Doolan joined Stubbs in Edinburgh in July last year and both men \u2014 who also worked together at Everton's youth academy \u2014 are highly regarded by new Wigan chairman David Sharpe. Former Celtic defender Stubbs who is on a two-year contract in Leith, has steered Hibs into the play-off positions in Scotland's second tier, albeit they have stumbled of late after three successive defeats. However, he would face an altogether different challenge with Wigan. They are eight points from safety after the 2-0 home defeat by Derby spelled the end for Mackay, and must win their next two games against Fulham and Millwall to stand any chance of survival. Former Scotland defender Gary Caldwell is expected to be handed the job on a temporary basis, while ex-Wigan player Danny Wilson is also under consideration. Former Wigan defender Gary Caldwell looks set to be handed the manager's role on a temporary basis . Meanwhile, Mackay's bid to rescue his managerial career was left in tatters after his dismissal. The 43-year-old was told of the decision during a brief meeting with Sharpe after losing to Derby. Mackay was handed the job by former owner Dave Whelan back in November against a backdrop of an FA investigation into a shocking series of text messages, exposed by Sportsmail. Cardiff City manager at the time, Mackay is accused of sending racist, sexist and homophobic messages in an exchange with former head of recruitment Iain Moody. The Scot remains under investigation by the FA and Monday's developments will not alter the speed with which his case is dealt. Sharpe, just a month into his new role as chairman, looked forlorn after Monday's game and made a snap decision to axe the Scot. Mackay won only five of his 25 fixtures in charge and picked up just three home points \u2014 damning statistics referenced in the club's official statement. Sharpe said: 'This is a very difficult decision to make but I feel that, for the long-term future of the club, there must be a change now.' Sportsmail understands Mackay was close to suffering the sack in February but victory at Reading granted him a stay of execution. Wigan were content with keeping him until at least the end of the season and kept faith with the divisive figure. Sources at the DW Stadium also indicated that Mackay was ready to build a similar recruitment structure to that at Cardiff and had been sanctioned to do so. He remained defiant they could stay in the division immediately after losing against Derby. 'It's still mathematically possible,' he said. 'It's fine lines between winning and losing in this league.' Wigan chairman David Sharpe has said that it was a 'very difficult' decision to sack Mackay on Monday .",

        "article": "Prince Harry will go on tough bush patrols and take part in 'indigenous engagement' programmes during his four-week secondment with Australian Defence Force, Kensington Palace has revealed. The prince is due to arrive in Australia on the 6th April and will split his time between capital Canberra, Sydney, Darwin and Perth. On arrival, Harry will be taken straight to the Australian War Memorial on arrival before heading to barracks to report for duty. On his way: Harry will deploy to Australia next week and will begin with a visit to the Australian War Memorial . Last trip: Harry last headed Down Under in 2013 when he took part in Navy celebrations . First though, he will pay his respects at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, where he will be joined by Governor General Sir Peter Cosgrove. Afterwards, the 30-year-old will tour the World War I and Afghanistan galleries before meeting members of the public. Harry will then report to Australia's defence chief, Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin, and army boss Lieutenant General David Morrison for duty. 'Prince Harry is tremendously looking forward to starting his four week attachment with the ADF,' said a source. 'It has been an opportunity he has been keen to explore for a couple of years now and is delighted to be able to do it before completing his military service with the British Armed Forces later this year.' News of Harry's deployment Down Under emerged two weeks ago, when Kensington Palace announced that the prince would be ending his army career after a decade of service. This month's secondment to Australia will be one of the final acts of his military life, which will come to an end this summer. Afterwards, the prince will travel to Africa to work on charitable projects before returning to the UK to take part in the Walk of Britain with injured veterans to support Walking With the Wounded. During his Australian military career, Captain Wales, as he is known in the Army, will take part in urban training exercises, regional bush patrols and joint fire exercises, and will also spend time meeting the local Aboriginal population. He will also briefly travel back in order to visit Turkey with the Prince of Wales later this month in order to take part in a memorial service for the men who fought and died at Gallipoli. The World War I battle, which pitted British forces against the Ottoman Empire, claimed the lives of 34,000 British soldiers, 8,700 Australians and 2,721 New Zealanders. Making friends: On that occasion, Harry met some of the locals and even pulled faces for a little boy . Warm welcome: Prince Harry was met by crowds of well-wishers during his last visit in October 2013 . Harry has visited Australia twice before, most recently in 2013 when he took part in the International Fleet Review in Sydney. Harry has served with the Australian Armed Forces in the past, most notably during his two tours of Afghanistan. 'He has met [Australian troops] during the Invictus Games and even trekked to the South Pole with a couple of Australian soldiers,' added the spokesman. 'Those experiences reinforced the huge admiration and respect he already had for Australian servicemen and women and has stoked his enthusiasm even more to build on those relationships in the next four weeks. Entertainer: Harry also met Prime Minister Tony Abbott, his wife and two daughters Bridget and Frances . 'He knows he will learn a huge amount from his Australian colleagues during this attachment and he is grateful to the ADF for producing such a varied and interesting programme for him. 'He is also looking forward to learning how wounded, injured and ill servicemen and women are supported here in Australia and hopes to pass on some of his experience from his current role in the UK. 'Prince Harry has been to Australia twice before, so he knows he is in for a great experience. He particularly appreciates the opportunity to pay his respects to the fallen by traveling straight to the Australian War Memorial in Canberra upon arrival into the country on Monday, and fully appreciates the significance of commemoration in this centenary year of the Gallipoli campaign.'",

The wing is able to morph itself like that of a bird to provide the same functionality as normal flaps, but with much less weight. It can also reportedly be used to increase fuel efficiency and even reduce noise on take-off and landing. Scroll down for videos . Nasa has been testing a flexible wing on a plane in California (shown). The wing can bend from -2 degrees up to 30 degrees. It means that regular flaps aren't needed - and it is much lighter. In this image, the technology is visible at the flat 'flap at the base of the wing . The latest test of the technology took place above Nasa\u2019s Armstrong Flight Research Center in Edwards, California. Over the past six months, 22 research flights of the Adaptive Compliant Trailing Edge (ACTE) flight control surface has taken place. The project is a collaboration between Nasa, the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and FlexSys from Ann Arbor Michigan. The wing is able to \u2018bend\u2019 through angles from -2 degrees up to 30 degrees. Test pilots have described it as being \u2018very smooth\u2019, while it can also deal with hard banking manoeuvres and extreme temperatures. For all the flights so far, the wing has flown in a fixed position on a Gulfstream III jet between these two extremes, to ensure risk is minimal. But for future flights, the wings will be able to change angles while in the air. The breakthrough could also increase fuel efficiency up to 12 per cent, and reduce noise at take-off and landing up to 40 per cent. The wing is shown above bending through its two extremes.\u00a0The project is a collaboration between Nasa, the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and FlexSys Inc from Ann Arbor Michigan. Credit: FlexSys . Figures suggest the breakthrough could increase fuel efficiency up to 12 per cent, and reduce noise at take-off and landing up to 40 per cent, compared to traditional wing flaps (one shown on a Boeing 737) A Transformer-style \u2018flying car\u2019 being developed by an Arizona company could soon spell the end of runways. The company\u2019s vision is to build a vehicle with four rotors that allow it to take to the air anywhere like a helicopter - and then switch to fly like a normal plane. While this \u2018SkyCruiser\u2019 vehicle is still some way from development, the technology could soon become a reality in a functioning prototype dubbed the \u2018SkyProwler\u2019. The SkyProwler has four horizontal propellers that allow it to perform vertical take-offs and landings, and to hover in mid-air. \u2018We are thrilled to have accomplished all of our flight test goals without encountering any significant technical issues,\u2019 said AFRL Program Manager Pete Flick, from Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio. \u2018These flights cap 17 years of technology maturation, beginning with AFRL\u2019s initial Phase 1 SBIR contract with FlexSys, and the technology now is ready to dramatically improve aircraft efficiency for the Air Force and the commercial aviation industry.\u2019 The technology can be fitted to existing airplane wings, so it does not require a complete redesign of current aircraft wings. \u2018The completion of this flight test campaign at Armstrong is a big step for Nasa's Environmentally Responsible Aviation Project,\u2019 said ERA project manager Fay Collier. \u2018This is the first of eight large-scale integrated technology demonstrations ERA is finishing up this year that are designed to reduce the impact of aviation on the environment.\u2019 It will take years for such a technology to be approved for commercial aircraft, though, so it\u2019s unlikely to be used on planes any time soon. But the cost and fuel economy benefits will be appealing to many if testing continues smoothly.",

        "article": "Memories of drunken escapades may make us blush, but now a computer can use similar facial flushes to recognise people who have had one drink too many. Greek researchers created the algorithm, which determines a person\u2019s state of intoxication by looking at the temperature of their face - especially the forehead and nose. And they say the technology could one day be installed in cars to spot drink drivers and stop them starting the ignition. Researchers from the University of Patras took thermal infrared photographs of 41 volunteers\u2019 faces, before and after drinking four glasses of wine. The scientists then used artificial neural networks to compare the sober (left) and drunken images (right) pixel-by-pixel (a single pixel is shown above the left eyebrow) Researchers from the University of Patras took thermal infrared photographs of 41 volunteers\u2019 faces, before and after drinking four glasses of wine. Thermographic cameras detect radiation in the infrared range of the spectrum and create images of the radiation, where warm areas are shown red and cooler areas, blue, for example. Many people feel warmer and have hot flushes after drinking alcohol, caused by the drug affecting brain chemistry and the circulatory system. When alcohol is absorbed into the blood stream it increases heart rate and blood pressure and blood vessels open wide to allow for more rapid flow, which causes some people to flush. Alcohol also affects the hypothalamus, which regulates the body's temperature. Thermographic cameras detect radiation in the infrared range of the spectrum and create images of the radiation, where warm areas are shown red and cooler areas, blue, for example. In the study, the researchers found that the temperature of the forehead and to a lesser extent, the nose, is the best indication of a person\u2019s drunken state and built an algorithm to recognise intoxication with 90% accuracy. While the alcohol got some volunteers more tipsy than others, they all had a blood alcohol content of at least 50 milligrams of alcohol in every 100 millilitres of blood. This figure is the drink driving limit in Scotland as well as most European countries \u2013 but slightly below the English and Welsh limit of 80 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood. The scientists then used artificial neural networks to compare the sober and drunken images pixel-by-pixel. They found that the temperature of the forehead, and to a lesser extent the nose, is the best indication of a person\u2019s drunken state and built an algorithm to recognise intoxication with 90 per cent accuracy. The scientists wrote in the study, published in the journal Forensic Journal International: \u2018It was found that it was mainly the face forehead that changed thermal behaviour with alcohol consumption.' The algorithm worked even on faces that it hadn\u2019t been trained on, and without comparing them to images of people when they were sober.

They found the temperature of the forehead and the nose is the best indication of a person\u2019s drunken state, and built an algorithm to recognise intoxication with 90% accuracy.

Alcohol also affects the hypothalamus, which regulates the body's temperature. Just three hours behind the wheel at night can make motorists drive as badly as if they were drunk, scientists claim. Driver tiredness after a few hours has the same effect as being over the drink-driving limit, a 2011 study revealed. Even two hours of motorway driving in the dark can affect performance so severely it is the same as having a couple of drinks. It's estimated that one-fifth of all traffic accidents are due to sleepiness behind the wheel and one in three people admit to nodding off while driving at night. The researchers hope their technology could be used by the police to spot intoxicated people who might start trouble at football matches, for example and say it could be installed in cars and lorries to spot potential drink drivers. It could perhaps work in tandem with other technology to stop a car from being able to be driven. Scientists in Germany are already working on a way to stop drink drivers getting behind the wheel by analysing their speechm for example. They announced in December they have created the first library of drunk speech patterns, which could be used to predict drunkenness by listening for vocal cues. Called the Alcohol Language Corpus, the database was made by researchers from Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and the Institute of Legal Medicine between 2007 and 2009 by giving people too much alcohol to drink, before recording conversations conducted in a stopped car, where the drunk person was sitting in the passenger seat. There are currently conversations from 162 German men and women in the publicly-available audio database. While the alcohol got some more tipsy than others, all the volunteers in the study had a blood alcohol content of 50 milligrams of alcohol in every 100 millilitres of blood, which is the\u00a0drink driving limit in Scotland as well as most European countries. A stock image illustrating drink driving is shown . The researchers hope their technology could be used by the police to spot intoxicated people who might start trouble at football matches, for example and say it could be installed in cars and lorries to spot potential drink drivers. Currently, breathalyzers (pictured) are used to measure alcohol content . From this, an algorithm capable of detecting whether someone is drunk by listening in on slurring speech patterns, was created by computer scientists at Queens College and Columbia University. They found they could detect drunken speech patterns much like identifying an accent. Drunken speech hallmarks include stammering and stuttering. Voices also tend to rise in pitch and words begin to slur, they said. It is hoped that the software could be used alongside devices such as locks and immobilisers to make it impossible for people to drive when drunk \u2013 perhaps by asking them a few questions while analysing the driver\u2019s voice. \u2018The cars themselves could listen to the driver, detect that the potential driver is intoxicated, and prevent the car from starting,\u2019 the researchers explained.",

        "article": "A Mexican . archaeologist hunting for a royal tomb in a tunnel . beneath a towering pre-Aztec pyramid has made a discovery that . may have brought him a step closer: liquid mercury. In the bowels of Teotihuacan, a mysterious ancient city that . was once the largest in the Americas, earlier this month Sergio Gomez found 'large quantities' of the silvery metal in a chamber at . the end of a sacred tunnel sealed for nearly 1,800 years. And because of the potential supernatural significance of liquid mercury in ritual ends, deeper into the complex Gomez hopes to find the elusive last resting place of a king. Scroll down for video . Hope: Mexican archaeologist Sergio Gomez has been excavating a pre-Aztec pyramid in Teotihuacan, Mexico, for six years and came across 'large quantities' of liquid mercury earlier this month . Underground: Gomez announced on Friday that he found the liquid mercury in a chamber at the end of a tunnel (pictured) that had been sealed off for more than 1,800 years . 'It's something that completely surprised us,' Gomez said at . the entrance to the tunnel below Teotihuacan's Pyramid of the . Plumed Serpent, about 30 miles  northeast of Mexico City. If Gomez is right, it could help settle a debate over how power was wielded in Teotihuacan, a city boasting massive stone pyramids that was home to as many as 200,000 people and the heart of ancient empire that flourished between 100 and 700 A.D. Some archaeologists believe the toxic element could herald . what would be the first ruler's tomb ever found in Teotihuacan, . a contemporary of several ancient Maya cities, but so shrouded . in mystery that its inhabitants still have no name. Unsure why the mercury was put there, Gomez says the metal . may have been used to symbolize an underworld river or lake. Though mercury has previously been uncovered in small amounts at a few Maya sites much . further south, it had never been found in Teotihuacan. Mercury was rare in ancient Mexico, as it was difficult to mine and prized for its reflective properties. Archaeologists believe it may . have had a supernatural significance for ritual ends. Teotihuacan, or 'abode of the gods' in the Aztec language of . Nahuatl, was distinct from the Mayan civilization. Royalty: Gomez said that he is unsure as to why the mercury was in the tunnel (pictured), but he hopes that it will lead him to the tomb of the city's king . Digging: National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) archaeologists work at a tunnel that may lead to a royal tombs discovered at the ancient city of Teotihuacan in 2011. Gomez said their findings could lead to settling the debate as to how power was distributed in the city . Its . inhabitants left behind no written record, abandoning the city . long before the Aztecs came to power in the 14th Century. Spaniards dug at Teotihuacan in the 1670s, but rigorous . scientific excavation of the site did not begin until the 1950s. Gomez's six-year slog in the tunnel has already yielded tens . of thousands of artifacts including stone sculptures, fine . jewelry and giant seashells leading to the three chambers. The . painstaking excavation has slowed due to extreme humidity, mud, . and now, the need for protective gear to avoid mercury . poisoning. George Cowgill, a U.S. archaeologist who has spent more than . four decades excavating Teotihuacan, says the mercury find . increases the odds of finding a tomb. 'But it's still very uncertain, and that is what keeps . everybody in suspense,' he added.

        "article": "Tom Lineham scored two interception tries in an eye-catching hat-trick as Hull FC beat Widnes 22-8 to make it back-to-back wins for the first time since last June. Lineham scored a treble in a losing cause at Castleford last month but his efforts on Friday night settled a drab contest at the KC Stadium. The 22-year-old winger showed good opportunism and no little speed on two occasions to pluck passes out of the air and race over 90 metres to add to his early opener. The hat-trick puts him out in front as Super League's most prolific finisher in 2015. Tom Lineham scored two interception tries in an eye-catching hat-trick as Hull FC beat Widnes 22-8 . Jamie Shaul went over late on to make sure of the two competition points for Hull, with tries from Kevin Brown and Patrick Ah Van unable to prevent Widnes from falling to a fifth away defeat out of five. It was a third match in nine days for both sides, although Widnes had reason to feel more hard done by after their Easter Monday trip to Catalans. Ah Van had an early opportunity to give the Vikings an extra spring in their step but a foot in touch saw his effort ruled out, although Rhys Hanbury's pass was forward in any case. There was no doubt when Lineham slid over in the corner at the other end after Shaul had spun out of a tackle and found his winger with a nice cut-out pass. The Vikings were defending doggedly near their own line to prevent a second Hull try when Stefan Marsh and Chris Dean were both forced off following a sickening clash of heads. Lineham had a good chance to lay the platform for another Hull raid following a break down the right but his pass was intercepted by former Black and Whites hooker Aaron Heremaia. Widnes worked their way downfield and were back level when Brown, whose high kick in the build-up appeared to have gone forward off Ah Van, forced the ball down from dummy half. The Vikings lost a third player as Lloyd White hobbled off, but they thought they had edged in front when Joe Mellor touched down his own dab through, only for the video referee to correctly rule a knock-on. What might have been a half-time lead turned into a six-point deficit as Lineham intercepted Brown's pass and raced 95 metres for a try which took him level with Castleford's Justin Carney on nine for the season. And he was out on his own as leading try scorer when he repeated the trick just after the break, Hanbury the victim on this occasion as he tried to find Ah Van 10 metres from the Hull line. Lineham almost turned provider on the hour mark but his wild pass could not be taken in by Shaul. Jordan Rankin was then wide with a 40-metre penalty attempt after play had been brought back for a shoulder charge by Eamon O'Carroll. But Hull did not have to wait too much longer for their next points as Rankin's grubber kick hit a post and sat up perfectly for Shaul to slide over. Widnes, who saw Gil Dudson held up over the line earlier in the half, gave themselves some hope when Ah Van finished spectacularly in the corner, but it proved no more than a consolation.",

        "article": "A Philadelphia woman was arrested Friday on charges she tried to join and martyr herself for the Islamic State group, a day after two women in New York were charged with plotting to wage jihad by building a bomb and using it for a Boston Marathon-type attack. Keonna Thomas, 30, was preparing to travel overseas to fight with the terror group, authorities said, but instead was arrested at her home. Authorities said that she communicated with an Islamic State group fighter in Syria who asked if she wanted to be part of a martyrdom operation and that she told the fighter that the opportunity 'would be amazing,' according to the documents. 'I can make that wish come true,' the fighter reportedly replied. She appeared in court this afternoon dressed entirely in black, with just her eyes showing, and will remain in custody until her next appearance on April 8. Scroll down for video . Keonna Thomas was arrested in Philadelphia (above) Friday as she tried to join ISIS . Thomas' home (above), which had been under surveillance by FBI for the past week, had American flags lined up outside . She also actively spoke of her desires on a Twitter account that has since been removed. 'I see why the mujahideen [violent jihadi fighters] Sacrifice Dunya [life on earth] for Akhirah [the afterlife] there's no comparison,' read one tweet according to NBC 4. Another said; 'Only thing I'm jealous of is when I see the smiles of shuhadaa [martyrs].' Her home, which had been under surveillance by FBI for the past week, had American flags lined up outside. In one exchange with the fighter, they discussed how he would shoot or behead his wife if she turned out to be a spy. 'Cutting head is more personal,' Thomas replied. It's unclear if she has a lawyer who could comment on the charges. She is due to make an initial appearance in federal court Friday afternoon. Thomas' arrest comes a day after two women were arrested in New York in another home-grown terror case. They are accused of plotting to wage violent jihad by building a homemade bomb and using it for an attack like the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings. The women were ordered held without bail after a brief court appearance Thursday. The lawyer for one of them said his client will plead not guilty. Thomas is charged with providing material aid to terrorists, one of the same charges filed in 2010 against another Pennsylvania woman, Colleen LaRose, known as Jihad Jane, and two co-defendants in a terror plot that prosecutors say also involved online messages and recruitment for overseas terror suspects. Thomas' posts in support of the Islamic State started in August 2013, when she reposted a Twitter photograph of a boy holding weapons, authorities charged. She called herself Fatayat Al Khilafah and YoungLioness and tweeted posts such as \"When you're a mujahid, your death becomes a wedding,\" according to the FBI affidavit filed in the case. A mujahid is one who engages in jihad. She soon began trying to raise money for the cause online and told a Somalia-based jihadi fighter from Minnesota that she soon hoped to have enough money to travel, authorities said. She applied for a passport in February and bought a ticket to travel to Barcelona on March 29, the affidavit said. Authorities would not immediately say why she had not made the trip. She is facing up to 15 years in prison. In the Jihadi Jane case, LaRose got a 10-year term in January for agreeing to kill Swedish artist Lars Vilks, who drew a cartoon that had offended Muslims, while another American woman, Jamie Paulin-Ramirez, got eight years. An immigrant teen from Pakistan got five years.",

Brian Cassidy was picking up trash outside the store in Bangor, Maine on Thursday when he discovered the wet stack of money beneath a large piece of paper in the parking lot. He immediately contacted store security to tell them what he had found and, realizing it was a sizable sum, they then contacted the police department, Sergeant Tim Cotton said. Officer Dustin Dow went to the store to take the report and learned that a man had visited the security office last winter to claim he had lost about $4,000 in the parking lot. Great work: Brian Cassidy, right, is pictured being presented with a Bangor Police Department Challenge coin by an officer after he found $4,400 cash in a Walmart parking lot and alerted security . The man, who was later identified as Ou Chen, said at the time that he had put the money in an envelope in his pocket after leaving work at a nearby restaurant. He had intended to send the money home to his family, Cotton said. But after clearing snow off his car and driving home, he realized that his pocket was empty. Chen went to the security office to ask if the money had been turned in or if surveillance footage had revealed what could have happened to it, but nothing emerged. When Dow heard of the story, he went to the nearby restaurant, Kobe Steakhouse, and asked for the man, and Chen confirmed he had misplaced the cash. After counting the money at the station, the officer returned to the restaurant to give it back to him - and to take a picture showing him gladly accepting it. Returned: The money belonged to Ou Chen, who lost the $4,000 as he cleared snow off his car last winter after leaving his job at a nearby restaurant. He told Walmart about it at the time but they could not find it . Stash: Cassidy found the money, pictured, while picking up trash near the Walmart parking lot last Thursday . Cotton applauded Brian for his honesty, particularly because the Walmart employee found the money while working at a job that does not pay much. 'Brian is not getting rich doing this and has dealt with other issues over the past year,' Cotton explained in a lengthy Facebook post. 'Brian, like many people, has even had to sleep in his car for a time when things were rough.' In recognition of his honesty, Cassidy was presented with a Bangor Police Department Challenge coin 'for being honest and having great integrity in doing his job', the department said. 'Brian Cassidy personifies what we hope is in all of us,' Cotton wrote. 'Thanks Brian, the men and women of the Bangor Police Department salute you.'

Jeanetta Riley, 35, a mother-of-three daughters was killed last July after she brandished a knife at two cops outside of a hospital in Sandpoint on the evening of July 8, 2014. The troubled Native American woman, who was addicted to meth and alcohol, had been taken to the hospital by her husband, 44-year-old Shane, following threats she made to kill herself, according to the\u00a0Guardian. While parked outside of the emergency room of Bonner General Hospital, she pulled a knife from under the car seat featuring a three-and-a-half-inch blade, and was confronted by police before she was shot and killed. In the video, Jeanetta is heard in an exchange with officers as they repeatedly tell her to put the knife down but she refuses before a commotion is heard and they shoot her. Jeanetta Riley (pictured left with her husband Shane), 35, a mother-of-three daughters was killed last July after she brandished a knife at two cops outside of a hospital in Sandpoint on the evening of July 8, 2014 . She was taken to hospital by her husband, Shane, after he heard her fiddling with blades and talked about killing herself and stabbing people (Jeanetta pictured above with her daughters\u00a0Dayna, top, Dolly, left, and Hannah, right) Officers Michael Valenzuela, 27 and Skyler Ziegler, 29 were cleared of any wrongdoing following the incident and the case was closed in November. In the footage, Valenzuela, Ziegler and a third officer, Garrett Johnson, 23 arrived at the scene where Jeanetta was sitting in the car holding the bottle of vodka and the knife. She then walked towards them with the knife at her side, according to the Guardian. In the footage, Ziegler is heard shouting\u00a0'walk over here' and 'show me your hands' before she responds 'f*** you. no.' She is told again to put down the knife and continues to refuse and shouts 'bring it on, no.' Jeanetta then steps off the curb and into the road towards the two officers when gun fired is heard, with three bullets striking her torso and one striking her heart. Jeanetta took the knife from under the car seat and was confronted by officers who repeatedly told her to put the knife down but she refused (above scenes from the incident) After she stepped off the curb and walked towards them, they fired their guns and she was killed (above the moment she was shot) The events leading to the incident unfolded when the couple, who was homeless and living out of a 1996 Chevrolet van parked next to a lake, had spent the day with Jeanetta's daughter, 13-year-old Hannah. Jeanetta and Shane had arguments earlier in the day that were escalating when she began mentioning harming herself. The pair dropped Hannah off at her stepfather's house, and after drinking half a bottle of vodka while back at their camp, Jeanetta spoke about killing herself and stabbing people, Shane said. When he heard her fiddling with blades he decided to take her to the hospital. The Native American woman, who was addicted to alcohol and meth, and drank half a bottle of vodka before she was taken to the hospital on the day she died . In the summer of 2012, Jeanetta married Shane and two years later the couple gave up their newborn baby for adoption . Shane said he told Jeanetta at the time: 'This isn't a joke. It's not a game.' While parked outside of the emergency room, Jeanetta took out the knife and Shane ran inside and told a staff member behind the desk to call the police. Following the exchange with police, Jeanetta was shot and killed. Valenzuela told detectives he thought she was 'absolutely gonna thrust at me' when he pulled the trigger, while Ziegler said the knife looked 'huge in her hands', according to the Guardian. In November, the officers were cleared of wrongdoing by a local prosecutor. Fourteen hours after Jeanetta was shot and killed, a dog called Arfee was fatally shot by police in nearby Coeur d\u2019Alene, in a killing that was ruled unjustified. His owner received an $80,000 payout two weeks ago as well as an apology from the mayor. Shane and Riley's three daughters so far have not even received an apology. The officers involved in the incident were cleared of any wrongdoing by a local prosecutor in November. Jeanetta and her husband were homeless and living out of their van which was parked next to a lake . On the day of the incident, Shane ran into the hospital (above) and alerted staff to call the police . Peter Reedy, an FBI-trained hostage negotiator and former sergeant, said the officers should not have gone so quickly into a tense stand-off with their guns drawn, he told the Guardian. He said: 'First of all, do nothing. Keep your distance, try to talk to her, don't even take your gun out of your holster, try to calm things down and work out what you're up against.' Reedy added: 'If they had not responded to the call they way she did, I truly believe she would be alive right now.' There are close to 1,000 people killed by police on average each year, according to a recent U.S. government study, and reportedly at least half of those fatally shot by police in the U.S. have mental health issues, another\u00a0study reported.",

Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester City were eliminated at the Champions League last 16 stage, and Everton were dumped out of the Europa League in the same round. Simeone, who takes Atletico to rivals Real Madrid for a Champions League quarter-final second leg on Wednesday night, thinks this season\u2019s failure should spark a response from the Premier League\u2019s top clubs.

The fact that there is no English team left in the last eight of the Champions League or in the Europa League is a wake-up call for the Premier League to look at why it is that, despite their great economic power and with all the many great footballers playing in England, Chelsea are so far ahead of everyone else and why they have no teams left in Europe.\u2019 Simeone believes that Spain is still home to the two best teams in Europe - Wednesday night\u2019s opponents Real Madrid, who have home advantage after a 0-0 draw at the Vicente Calderon last week, and Barcelona. \u2018For us at Atletico, we are competing against two teams with the obligation of winning the Champions League,\u2019 he said. \u2018At the very least, Madrid and Barcelona are among the last eight in Europe every season and usually the last four, so for Atletico to win La Liga last season was a tremendous achievement.\u2019 Diego Godin (left) and Raul Garcia (centre) smile as Fernando Torres makes a point during training on Tuesday .

        "article": "(CNN)It lays claim to being the most isolated human settlement on earth, a volcanic archipelago in the South Atlantic Ocean, home to just under 270 people. Now, the tiny settlement of Tristan da Cunha is seeking the help of architects and designers the world over to secure its future well into the 21st century. With the help of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), the UK overseas territory is holding an international competition to improve aging infrastructure and make the island self-sustainable as it approaches the 200th anniversary of its settlement. As a sign of just how removed Tristan da Cunha is from the rest of the world, there are only seven family names on the islands. Those who live there are mainly the descendants of Dutch, American and Italian sailors as well as 19th century British explorers. There are also a handful of expatriate Brits. But watching hit TV series \"Lost\"or reading up on William Golding's \"Lord of the Flies\" won't be required research for competition entrants. Instead, those with experience of renewable energy in remote regions, modern housing and developing cost-effective agrarian systems are encouraged to apply. \"The competition is looking at enhancing the built environment on the island (and) making all structures more energy efficient,\" the island's administrator, Alex Mitcham told CNN when visiting the UK recently. Mitcham explained that most existing homes and public buildings on Tristan da Cunha are small, bungalow-type structures made from made from a mix of concrete and local volcanic rock. Few have simple insulation that can lead to energy savings while the infrastructure for things like renewable power generation and internet provision remain limited. The island is also only accessible by sea 60-days-a-year through a small port in its only town, Edinburgh of the Seven Seas. According to James Porter of RIBA Competitions, contestants will have to factor in irregular design questions such as \"how can we get the material ashore and how can we actually think of ways that we can put things together once there?\" \"There are limitations on the amount of cargo that can be trans-shipped,\" he added. In total, Tristan da Cunha is made up of four islands. Tristan is the largest land mass and the only one to house people. Two more unpopulated islands, Nightingale and Inaccessible, lie close by. A third, Gough, is situated roughly 230 miles away. Both Gough and Inaccessible are UNESCO World Heritage sites. The closest mainland port is Cape Town, South Africa, some seven days sailing time and 1,750 miles north-east. Tristan already has a pub, shop, cafe, dance hall, museum, catholic church and swimming pool. There are also two expatriate doctors, two Tristanian nurses and school teachers with some 30 students of varying ages. The island's main industry is lobster fishing, with exports reaching as far afield as the U.S., Australia, Japan and the EU thanks to a fishing company that has exclusive rights to fish in the surrounding waters. Tristan earns additional income from the sale of unique stamps, coins and handicraft souvenirs, Mitcham explained. Modest revenue also flows from tourism and visitor accommodation. \"As it is the remotest inhabited island in the world, the Tristanians are already very self sufficient, being able to produce many of their own foodstuffs (like fish, livestock and potatoes),\" Mitcham said. However, the cost of living has increased in recent years, he added. With limited transport and communication links, the islanders are also keen to see how they can reduce their reliance on fossil fuels, improve the energy efficiency of properties and reduce imports. \"We are slowly updating 40-year old infrastructure,\" Mitcham said of the last time the island experienced a major redesign. That modernization happened roughly a decade after the island was evacuated temporarily due to ongoing volcanic activity. Before that period, the main way for the islanders to communicate with the outside world was by Morse code. Things have already changed a lot since then, however. \"A new water system, electrical system and waste water system have just been completed,\" Mitcham said. \"And with the 200th Anniversary of the founding of Tristan (2016) almost upon us it is an appropriate time to look at new initiatives that may be able to help the future viability of the community.\" Interested architects have until mid-June to submit their initial ideas. The best will be whittled down to an initial 20 and then five after further analysis between June and September. Porter and Mitcham say the islanders will have to apply to the UK and possibly the EU for grants to fund the project. The winner is penciled in to be announced in June 2016. The most important aspect for applicants is to \"identify cost-effective and practical solutions to improve the energy efficiency (through renewable energy sources) of properties,\" Mitcham said \"as well as modernizing ... government structures.\"",

        "article": "We are all guilty of taking the odd cheesy tourist photo, be it trying to push the Leaning Tower of Pisa, or 'touch' the top of a pyramid. One traveller in particular knows how wrong a holiday snap can go, after he posted a picture online of him 'missing' the top of the Eiffel Tower and asked users to help improve his photo. On a recent trip to Paris, Belgian food blogger Yves Van De Ven enjoyed poking fun at those tourist clich\u00e9s and took a couple of pictures deliberately missing some of the more famous monuments. Little did he know he would become an internet sensation, after his photo with the Eiffel Tower captioned 'nailed it' was uploaded to photosharing website 4chan. Since then over 100 photoshopped pictures have sprung up comically connecting his finger with the tip of the famous attraction, and it didn't stop there... Nailed it!\u00a0Yves Van De Ven, 37, uploaded this photograph on social media in a bid to poke fun of the typical tourist pictures . Going viral! An upload on photo-sharing site 4chan requested users connect his finger with the top of the tower, as many tourist pictures aim to achieve . The 37-year-old said he thought it would be hilarious to deliberately make fun of the typical pictures with famous landmarks. 'The original pictures in which me and my friends 'nailed it' were an instant hit with my friends as soon as I posted them on Facebook,' Van De Ven said. 'There were people that thought we just took poor pictures but luckily most of my friends know better.' Obviously the internet had something to say about the pictures and after someone uploaded the pictures to 4chan, users from all over the globe submitted their own 'improved' versions of Van De Ven's pictures. Created images ranged from the comical, with the 301m tower bent over to touch his outstretched finger, to the absurd, with Van De Ven imposed into Michaelango's Creation of Adam, reaching out towards the Eiffel Tower. The wondrous offerings demonstrate what a brilliant place the internet is, and how no one's holiday pictures are safe. Bendy tower! The tower appears to have flopped over in the summer heat, making a connection with the food blogger's finger . Cut out! Despite covering the 37-year-old, his finger is clearly in contact in this picture! Expert photoshopping creates a miniature tower touching his finger, never mind about the gaping white hole left behind! Close enough! Tilting the tower 45 degrees, and extending his arm in an octopus fashion were methods used to 'improve' the picture . Super hero! In a Hulk-like fashion, not only has\u00a0Van De Ven knocked over the Eiffel Tower, but also has it grasped in two fingers . Van De Ven is shocked but highly entertained at the widespread response to his holiday pictures. 'I can honestly say that we have had as much fun taking these silly pictures as we have had the week after overviewing the hilarious aftermath. 'Some of the photoshopped pictures are just brilliant.' Eiffel Tower touches\u00a0Van De Ven! This photo plays on role reversal with the tower spectacularly missing touching him . Basically there! A longer arm is all it takes to recreate the popular tourist pose . If in doubt, enlarge the poser (left), or do as most people do and stand closer to the camera! Or why not create more failed fingers (right) to add to the picture? Why not just duplicate the offending failed finger all over the Eiffel Tower? (Still without it making contact!) See double! That works! Not only does he touch the top, he does it twice in this picture . A portal has allowed the tip of the tower to protrude near the blogger's feet so he can touch the tip . Why not ignore the failed hand all together, and just reposition it on top? Job done! (left) Or why not reverse the original photograph? (right) So elegant! The original pose has been imposed on a ballerina dancing on a studio . Another wondrous offering from the internet shows him expertly defending a basketball hoop . The internet wins again!\u00a0Van De Ven (as God) reaching out for the Eiffel Tower (as man) in Michelangelo's famous painting,\u00a0The Creation of Adam . Bullrilliant!\u00a0Van De Ven becomes a matador unperturbed by a bull with horns consisting of the Eiffel Tower .",

        "article": "(CNN)Kanye West has settled a lawsuit with a paparazzi photographer he assaulted -- and the two have shaken on it. The photographer, Daniel Ramos, had filed the civil suit against West  after the hip-hop star attacked him and tried to wrestle his camera from him in July 2013 at Los Angeles International Airport. West pleaded no contest last year to a misdemeanor count of battery over the scuffle. A judge sentenced him to two years' probation, as well as anger management sessions and community service. Ramos and his lawyer, Gloria Allred, sought general and punitive damages in the civil suit, saying that West had interfered with the photographer's rights to pursue a lawful occupation. The case had been set for trial next week, but Allred issued a statement Tuesday night saying Ramos' side had filed a dismissal \"because the case was settled to the satisfaction of the parties.\" She didn't disclose the details of the settlement other than saying that \"one important aspect of it was an apology by Kanye West to our client, Daniel Ramos.\" Her statement included a picture of West and Ramos shaking hands, which she said happened after the apology. The original incident was caught on video, including the following exchange. \"Kanye! Kanye! Talk to me, Kanye!\" Ramos shouts outside a terminal at the Los Angeles airport on the night of July 19, 2013. \"What's' going on? Why can't we talk to you?  I mean, why?\" he asks as West moves through a group of paparazzi. \"Now come on, Kanye, I don't want to fight with you,\" he says as West advances toward him. \"I told you, don't talk to me, right,\" West says. \"You're trying to get me in trouble so I step off and have to pay you like $250,000.\" West is then seen rushing the photographer and attempting to wrestle his camera from his hands. West retreats after about 15 seconds of scuffling with the photographer. \"We believe that this case sent an important message,\" Allred said. \"Celebrities are not above the law, and they have no right to physically attack someone simply because they were asked a question.\" Beverly Hills Police investigated an incident in January 2014 in which West was accused of assaulting a man at a Beverly Hills chiropractor's office. West avoided criminal charges by reaching a civil settlement with the man. Kanye West apologizes to Beck, Bruno Mars . CNN's Sonya Hamasaki contributed to this report.",

        "article": "(CNN)I've visited Nepal at least half a dozen times over the last decade, and of the more than 100 countries that Save the Children serves, it is undoubtedly one of my favorites. There are the usual things that are said about it -- the stunning landscape, which includes Mount Everest, and the amazing food. But Nepal has also made some of the most remarkable progress on maternal and child health in the last few years. In fact, I remember a time just last May when I sat with a group of mothers and their tiny babies as they told me how proud they were that they now understood how important it was to make sure they prioritized breastfeeding and nutritious foods. They spoke of the wonderful future they were now expecting for their children, and they shared with me the big dreams that they had. So you can imagine the indescribable sadness I experienced waking up this morning and seeing the news reports that Nepal had been hit by its worst earthquake since 1934, when more than 10,000 people were killed. While casualty accounts following the magnitude-7.8 quake Saturday are still difficult to confirm -- hardly surprising considering that communication lines have been severely disrupted -- estimates we are hearing from the ground are already placing the number lost in the thousands, with the official toll now at around 1,500 expected to keep growing as the hours and days pass. The fact that the epicenter of this quake was so close to the capital of Kathmandu, where the majority of Nepal's citizens reside, makes the situation even more dire. Many of these people live in cramped conditions and have never lived outside the city. As a result, it is unlikely they even have a home village to go to temporarily for shelter. Housing the scores of newly homeless will be a tall order. It is still quite cold at night in Nepal, so getting these people into shelters quickly will be of the utmost importance. Compounding this very serious problem will be the difficulty in ensuring that those affected have access to clean water in the coming days; Nepal already had one of the lowest standards of sanitation in the world before the quake. In fact, even getting food to people will be a logistical nightmare, given that the entire country -- which is about the size of Tennessee -- is served by only two main roads, which have likely been badly damaged, if not destroyed. We have been in situations like this before, and know what to do. But time is not on our side -- we have only a few short weeks before the rainy season begins, which will make an already difficult job close to impossible. With that in mind, we have set up a fund to help address the immediate needs of children, who are always the most vulnerable in an emergency. We and other relief organizations will be doing everything we can to help get Nepal back on its feet without having to wait for more people to die from diseases that will inevitably come from contaminated water and the like. Only the oldest Nepalese will remember the last major earthquake, so the psychological toll for the majority of the country will be a significant and ongoing concerning for us as we and other agencies launch our response. And while we can rebuild Nepal after this tragedy, it will take time and help. I hope that we can all play a role in making sure that the tremendous gains that have been made in this country that I love so dearly will not have been in vain.",

'Africa is comfortable having you. Africa stays with you,' Hayatou said, according to a transcript of his comments provided by CAF. Sepp Blatter (left) has received the full backing of African football's president Issa Hayatou (right) Blatter was also present, and made a speech to the African football leaders in his role as FIFA president. Although the individual countries don't have to follow Hayatou's directive, Africa is expected to be a strong base of support for Blatter. With 54 of the 209 FIFA member countries eligible to vote in the presidential election in Zurich on May 29, Africa is the largest of the six continental confederations. The praise Blatter received in Egypt contrasted to his uncomfortable reception at the UEFA congress last month, when his presidency was criticized by the three candidates standing against him, and some European officials. Luis Figo (left) and Michael van Pragg (right) are opposing Blatter and have chosen to run for presidency . Hayatou, a FIFA vice president and now an ally of Blatter after failing to unseat him in 2002, made an apparent reference to that UEFA congress on Tuesday. 'Dear Sepp,' he said. 'I want to reiterate that here in Africa you are never on some strange or hostile territory. You shall always be at home here, on this continent.' Blatter is seeking a fifth term in office to extend a reign that began in 1998. FIFA vice president Prince Ali bin al-Hussein of Jordan, Dutch FA head Michael van Praag, and former Portugal international Luis Figo are standing against him. Prince Ali bin al-Hussein is the third challenger and the FIFA vice-president was in attendance in Zimbabwe . Those three challengers won't be addressing CAF delegates like they did at UEFA's congress. CAF said the three were attending merely as 'observers.' In his speech, Blatter reflected on Africa's achievements during his time as FIFA president, including the continent's first World Cup in South Africa in 2010. He said Cameroon's Hayatou, who has led CAF for 27 years despite allegations of corruption and an official reprimand by the IOC, was a 'pillar' of African football, according to CAF.",

A senior doctor facing sexual assault allegations from two separate nurses is accused of groping the breast of one of them and saying 'you bad girl' after smacking her on the bottom. A&E consultant Dr Ram Manohar, 38, is alleged to have inappropriately touched the nurses in 2013, while working at Wirral's Arrowe Park Hospital. David McLachlan, prosecuting, said Manohar offered to help Nurse A with her training on December 23, 2013,\u00a0Liverpool Crown Court heard. He said she knew Manohar and, while in his room, asked for his help to learn about matters including chest X-rays. Mr McLachlan said: 'Without any warning Ram Manohar put his hand down her nurse's dress and he put his hands into her bra.' She said he moved his hand around but she had not asked for a demonstration. Nurse A said he later asked her a question about the heart, which she got wrong. She said: 'He smacked me on the bottom quite hard and said to me, \"you bad girl\".' Mr McLachlan said Manohar squeezed her left breast to indicate where her left ventricle was and while discussing breast lumps asked to see her nipple, but she refused. She said the conversation moved onto the femoral pulse. Mr McLachlan said: 'Without any word of warning he put his hand up her dress and down her tights.' Manohar then allegedly touched her inappropriately. Nurse A said he told her 'this type of teaching is only for you' before she left the room 'feeling disgusted with herself'. She later told friends she felt 'violated' before contacting police. Manohar told officers he had known her since working with her at the Royal Liverpool Hospital. He said after a night out she had asked him back to her house, but he had refused. He said she had also asked him on December 12 'to find her a single and smart man because she was desperate'. Manohar said on December 23 she unzipped her top, making him uncomfortable, and followed him around 'like a puppy'. The doctor denied touching her inappropriately and said his office door had been open. He said she had been pointing to different parts of her body and 'if anybody had grounds to complain it would have been him,' adding 'he did not find her particularly attractive'. Manohar is alleged to have inappropriately touched the nurses in 2013, while working at Wirral's Arrowe Park Hospital (pictured). Nurse A said he groped her breast after she asked him about chest X-rays . Nurse B alleged that Manohar touched her inappropriately on July 10 and October 31, 2013. She said the first time she went to A&E because she had pins and needles in her hands and feet. Nurse B said he examined and touched her genital area. However, she said she thought he had been professional and thanked him before he gave her a hug. She said on October 31 she saw him about a 'very bad headache' and he treated her in a dark room, checking her reflexes before touching her genital area. The A&E consultant claims he had been pointing to different parts of Nurse A's body and 'if anybody had grounds to complain it would have been him,' adding 'he did not find her particularly attractive' Nurse B again thought he had acted professionally and went to the hospital to drop off a thank you card. She said he invited her to meet him for coffee and she went to the hospital for 'a coffee type date' because she did not know he was married. Nurse B alleged Manohar invited her into his office, kissed her, told her how beautiful she was and suddenly without warning put his hand into her knickers. Mr McLachlan said: 'She stopped him straightaway. He told her that he was married with children.' Nurse B also reported him to the police. Manohar told officers he did not inappropriately touch her during either examination. He said she told him she had feelings for him but he said he was married and she started crying. Manohar admitted he then kissed her but said he did not think he had put his hand into her knickers. He said: 'I think she caught my hand and put it on top of her trousers or something.'

The UN's rights chief has urged Britain to crack down on tabloid newspapers inciting racial hatred after a columnist for The Sun called migrants 'cockroaches'. In a hard-hitting statement, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Husein said Katie Hopkins had used language similar to that employed by some Rwandan media outlets in the run-up to the 1994 genocide, and by the Nazis in the 1930s. He said the April 17 article in the newspaper was reflective of a 'nasty underbelly of racism that is characterising the migration debate in an increasing number of EU countries'. This was also 'sapping compassion for the thousands of people fleeing conflict, human rights violations and economic deprivation who are drowning in the Mediterranean,' he said. The article came as migrant boat tragedies in the Mediterranean escalated. Already, more than 1,750 people have died this year making the perilous sea crossing to try to reach Europe - 30 times higher than the same period in 2014. Zeid asked British authorities, media, and regulatory bodies to take immediate steps to stop racial and inflammatory articles. 'This vicious verbal assault on migrants and asylum seekers in the UK tabloid press has continued unchallenged under the law for far too long,' he said. 'The Sun's editors took an editorial decision to publish this article, and - if it is found in breach of the law - should be held responsible along with the author.' The high commissioner said the Hopkins piece was 'simply one of the more extreme examples of thousands of anti-foreigner articles that have appeared in UK tabloids over the past two decades.' He also asked all European countries to take a firmer line on racism and xenophobia. Eritrean migrant Wegasi Nebiat is saved by rescuers after the wooden boat carrying her crashed off the popular Greek island of Rhodes . Death of a child: More than 1,750 people have already died this year making the perilous sea crossing to try to reach Europe - 30 times higher than the same period in 2014 . Clinging on: Migrants trying to reach Greece are seen onboard a capsizing sailboat off the coast of Rhodes . 'Make no mistake, these migrants are like cockroaches,' she wrote. 'They might look like 'Bob Geldof's Ethiopia circa 1984' but they are built to survive a nuclear bomb.' 'It is extraordinary and deeply shameful to see these types of tactics being used in a variety of countries, simply because racism and xenophobia are so easy to arouse in order to win votes or sell newspapers.' The columnist also said Europe should adopt a hardline approach to clandestine immigration like Australia by using navy ships to turn back boats carrying asylum seekers. 'Britain is not El Dorado,' Hopkins said. 'Some of our towns are festering sores, plagued by swarms of migrants and asylum seekers, shelling out benefits like Monopoly money.' Zeid said provocative articles could trigger dangerous reactions. 'It is extraordinary and deeply shameful to see these types of tactics being used in a variety of countries, simply because racism and xenophobia are so easy to arouse in order to win votes or sell newspapers.' Chaos: Debris from the wooden ship in the Mediterranean. Coastguards in Rhodes say the migrant crisis is a problem not just for Greece and Italy, but for all of Europe . Desperate: Migrants who were trying to reach Greece hold onto the wreckage of a sailboat near the coast of the southeastern island of Rhodes earlier this week . Joy: Rescued migrants disembark an Italian Coast Guard vessel in the Sicilian harbour of Catania earlier this week, throwing their hands in the air in celebration at surviving the perillous journey . Ed Miliband has been accused of stooping to a 'shameful' new low by blaming David Cameron for the Mediterranean refugee crisis. The Labour leader  used a keynote campaign speech today to suggest the deaths of hundreds of refugees fleeing North Africa could have been avoided if the Prime Minister had done more following his intervention in Libya to remove the former dictator Colonel Gaddafi. In a briefing note sent out before the speech, Labour went further - claiming the crisis was 'in part a direct result' of Mr Cameron's foreign policy. Anger: Ed Miliband, speaking at Chatham House in central London this morning, has been accused of stooping to a 'shameful' new low by blaming David Cameron for the Mediterranean refugee crisis . The provocative allegation has provoked a furious response from the Tories who this morning demanded that Mr Miliband apologise for the 'outrageous and disgraceful' remarks. It comes after Mr Cameron held emergency talks with EU leaders in Brussels yesterday over how to tackle the growing humanitarian crisis. The Prime Minister announced the deployment of one of Britain's biggest warships - HMS Bulwark - as part of beefed-up efforts to prevent more refugees packing onto tiny boats. Up to 1,750 refugees have lost their lives trying to reach Europe this year - out of around 35,000 who have tried to make the crossing. The vast majority of the migrant boats set off from the Libya, which has descended into chaos in the aftermath of the 2011 revolution which saw Colonel Gaddafi swept from power with the support of France and Britain.",

        "article": "A teenager who allegedly racially abused a security guard on a train has been dubbed 'public enemy number one' as a magistrate warned him to pull his head in following his release on bail. Abdel-Kader Russell-Boumzar was granted bail in Brisbane's Magistrate Court on Thursday after a 69 day stint behind bars for a string of alleged offences. The 17-year-old\u00a0shot to notoriety last October when footage of him  apparently spitting on 56-year-old Josphat Mkhwananzi while racially abusing him on a Brisbane train went viral. Scroll down for video . Abdel-Kader Russell-Boumzar was granted bail in Brisbane's Magistrate Court on Thursday after a 69 day stint behind bars for a string of alleged offences . He was charged with numerous offences, including serious assault, creating a disturbance and racial vilification. Since then he's been accused of repeatedly breaching his bail by flashing his backside at a young boy, being drunk in public during Schoolies' week on the Gold Coast, being a public nuisance and becoming involved in a brawl at a skate park. Russell-Boumzar was jailed in January after the skate park incident but will now walk free after 69 days behind bars with  Magistrate Deborah Vasta deciding  he had learned his lesson. 'You need to pull your head in,' she told the teenager. Russell-Boumzar first came into the spotlight when a video of him allegeldy spitting on and racially abusing 56-year-old train guard\u00a0Josphat Mkhwananzi went viral . Magistrate Vasta said it seemed he'd 'gone off the rails' with a 'stupid meltdown' on the train. She said Russell-Boumzar was currently 'public enemy number one' and warned him he would be targeted once released on bail. 'The ball's in your court,' she told him. 'Running around being a big man in town does not cut it when you're in a detention centre.' Russell-Boumzar replied: 'I really understand'. The teen must abide by strict bail conditions, including a curfew, a ban on entering train stations, and no contact with certain associates including the friend who filmed the racist rant. The decision to release Russell-Boumzar came despite a warning by crown prosecutor Megan Fowke. In the viral video, Russell-Boumzar allegedly refers to the train guard as 'n*****' and a 'black c***' repeatedly before he continues to explode into a racist rant during the five-minute video . The 17-year-old has re-appeared in court a number of times since last October after being accused of repeatedly breaching his bail . 'He is a risk, not only to himself but to the community ... he has shown disdain for not only his bail conditions but also this court and its orders,' she argued. Russell-Boumzar is back in Brisbane Magistrates Court on May 4 for charges relating to the train incident. In the viral video, Russell-Boumzar allegedly refers to the train guard as 'n*****' and a 'black c***' repeatedly before he continues to\u00a0explode into a racist rant during the five-minute video. 'Do you want to come to Australia to learn some proper English?' the teenager said in the video. Shocking footage of an intoxicated young man hurling a tirade of racist abuse on a Brisbane train at a security guard went viral. The guard 'Joe' has been commended for his calm actions during the incident . The teen must abide by strict bail conditions, including a curfew, a ban on entering train stations, and no contact with certain associates including the friend who filmed the racist rant . 'That is the issue c*** - learn some f*****g English 'cause this is Australia c*** because I can't understand you.' 'No, look my n****r brother... I got my feet off the f*****g seat.' 'Don't touch me, I don't want to speak to you, I don't understand you,' the 17-year-old said. 'Bro, if you want to be a security guard, learn some English first.' An attendant is heard telling the young man to 'get off' at the next stop. Another security guard, wearing a blue top, is seen walking towards the teenager as he continues to drunkenly slur his words to another train worker. Train passengers are seen looking outraged as the teenager utters racial insults before his friend grabs his top and tries to drag him off the train. 'Joe' the security guard remained poised and professional . Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.",

        "article": "Shops are full of red dresses this year, so should you be tempted to trade in your LBD for an LRD? It\u2019s a colour that radiates energy and sexiness, but that can all be wrecked if the style doesn\u2019t suit you. We asked Kate Battersby to try six looks to see which work \u2014 and which absolutely don\u2019t. Scroll down for video . I LOOK SO OLD IN THIS! Dress, \u00a3270, Gina Bacconi at johnlewis.com . Shoes, \u00a3485, biondacastana.com . Lace may be back in fashion, but to me it\u2019s unfailingly ageing. The unattractive shade of orangey-red is made worse by the colour of the underslip \u2014 a queasy pale peach. Its weight suggests that it\u2019s reinforced concrete and while thick fabric can smooth problem areas, here it bulges at the waist. The shallow V-neck doesn\u2019t enhance my bust, the sash creates matronliness and the asymmetric lace around the neckline looks torn. 0/5 . IT COULD BE DESIGNER . Dress, \u00a3150, Adrianna Papell at\u00a0johnlewis.com . Sandals, \u00a3255,\u00a0lucychoilondon.com . The lipstick red shade complements pale and deeper skin tones. The ruched style is reminiscent of Herve Leger\u2019s famous bandage dresses, insofar as the fabric stretches to flatter just where it\u2019s needed. My 36DD bust means that a bateau neckline usually creates a gigantic shelf of bosom, but the sheer panel on this stylish dress is an ingenious solution. 4/5 . FIGURE-HUGGING FAILSAFE . Dress, \u00a389,\u00a0divacatwalk.com . Sandals, \u00a3395,\u00a0carlopazolini.com . Several celebs turn to this British brand\u2019s curve-hugging designs, with Nigella Lawson a devotee. This dress looks great on the hanger and I can\u2019t wait to try it on. The fit is divine and the dress feels marvellous. The hourglass silhouette has me embracing my inner Joan Holloway from Mad Men. 4/5 . TOTAL KNOCKOUT . Dress, \u00a3265,\u00a0thefoldlondon.com . Shoes, \u00a3575,\u00a0biondacastana.com . It is difficult to overstate how utterly horrible this looks on the hanger \u2014 a drearily shapeless, nondescript sack. Imagine my amazement at the transformation once it\u2019s on. The fit is great, with a length that does wonders for your legs, and the cowl neck provides just enough detail to prevent my bust from creating a vista of bare chest. 4/5 . ONE-SHOULDER SUPERSTAR . Dress, \u00a3189,\u00a0gorgeouscouture.com . A floor-length gown is not top of my must-haves. But it\u2019s always good to have a dress in the wardrobe that makes you feel a knockout. One-shoulder designs create glamour, and in this case the broader band of fabric at the shoulder flatters the exposed arm. Draping and ruching will flatter any figure, and the dress is helped by a body- hugging underslip. \u2018Very Michelle Obama,\u2019 said an onlooker. 5/5 . CRIMSON NIGHTMARE . Dress, \u00a348,\u00a0asos.com . Heels, \u00a3195,\u00a0lkbennett.com . First the good news: this crimson colour scores highly for drama, no matter what your skin tone or hair colour. Next, the fit, which is fabulous over my hips and waist, but less so in the bodice. In my case another reason to fear the ultra-plunge neckline is that sensitive skins can become blotchy in the decolletage area when we are too hot. In any case, there is so much going on it\u2019s easy to be drowned in all the detail. 2/5 .",

        "article": "It really is tough to think of a previous Premier League game of such importance being undercut by this depth of friendship between dugouts. Tim Sherwood and Chris Ramsey know each other inside out. They also know how their careers could be shaped by 90 minutes of football at Villa Park. From living 10 minutes apart in Buckinghamshire and Bedfordshire, the pair will be 10 metres away from each other on a touchline in Birmingham, relishing the pressure. The careers of Tim Sherwood (above) and Chris Ramsey (below) could be shaped by 90 minutes on Tuesday . Ramsey's QPR go to the home of Sherwood's Villa for a match that could see them out of the bottom three . A match of this magnitude is what these two English coaches craved during years working together at Tottenham Hotspur, probably believing they would be united in battle. A quirky sequence of events has pitted them on opposite sides instead. Sherwood came close to the QPR job when Harry Redknapp resigned, but Paul Lambert was sacked in the same period and Aston Villa placed the call. Ramsey looked the unlikely choice at Loftus Road but guided QPR to their first away Premier League victory this season at Sunderland, earning the reins until the summer. A second win on the road at West Bromwich Albion on Saturday means QPR can go above Villa with three points on Tuesday night, plunging Sherwood\u2019s team into the relegation zone. The reverse result would take Villa to the precipice of safety, leaving QPR with a fainter glimmer of hope. QPR come into the match with confidence after a convincing 4-1 victory over Villa's neighbours West Brom . Christian Benteke celebrates his goal in Villa's 3-1 defeat by Manchester United on Saturday . It is a sliding doors match, the kind to be looked back upon in months to come as the moment futures were directed, both for clubs and managers. Lose and suffer relegation? Sherwood\u2019s position would come under considerable question, his trajectory as the bright thing of English coaching skewered. Ramsey would likely be shuffled back to a role behind the curtain. Win and survive? Reputation enhanced, the opportunity to lay foundations would be presented. Either way, this pair will share pints again, unpicking the evening when their top-flight statuses came under enormous scrutiny. Neither Sherwood nor Ramsey has been trying to underplay this match, even if one offered a little more bombast than the other. \u2018I think this is the biggest game that a lot of these players have ever played for this football club,\u2019 said Sherwood. \u2018If I could hype up the pressure even more I would.\u2019 \u2018A win would be a fantastic boost for us because it would see us above the line,\u2019 said Ramsey. \u2018It would give the fans a lot of hope that we have a chance of staying up.\u2019 Neighbours within 10 minutes and friends, Ramsey (centre) and Sherwood (right) know each other inside out . The pair worked together at Spurs with Les Ferdinand (second right), now QPR's director of football . Under the floodlights, this promises to be a thrilling night of action. Villa Park has already enjoyed that with back-to-back matches in darkness against West Brom. The second victory, in the FA Cup, sparked a pitch invasion. The atmosphere against QPR will be tense and frenetic again. Sherwood will live every moment on the sidelines, Ramsey will be more considered. There are likely to be some telling looks either direction. Both would be inclined to work with each other again. \u2018He\u2019s a good pal of mine and a very loyal friend, but it\u2019s been put to one side,\u2019 insisted Sherwood. \u2018Considering we worked together for four-five years before, there is going to be some sort of strange feeling,\u2019 said Ramsey. Once the whistle blows it is down to the players, of course. QPR\u2019s will bounce into action off the back of one of their finest performances this season. Villa underwhelmed in defeat at Old Trafford. The Hyatt hotel just off Broad Street brought comfort for Ramsey\u2019s squad during their trip to the Second City three days ago, but Eduardo Vargas, scorer of two in two, will be missing through injury this time. Bobby Zamora, who claimed a wonderful strike at the Hawthorns, has been wrapped in cotton wool over the weekend. QPR will be without Eduardo Vargas, who scored his second in two games against West Brom . Alan Hutton, Ashley Westwood and Scott Sinclair are out for Villa, Tom Cleverley, Aly Cissokho and Kieran Richardson major doubts. Sherwood wants attacking football with a gritty underbelly, Ramsey is likely to map out a plan to threaten on the break. Twice Villa have been beaten late at home under Sherwood, as Ramsey will be aware. Quality may suffer in the circumstances, but excitement should still course through the encounter. High drama awaits. Christian Benteke . Struggled on return form Achilles injury and looked disinterested at times under Lambert, seems to have found his mojo for Sherwood as four goals in four games testifies. Should strike terror into QPR at his best. Fabian Delph . The beating heart of Aston Villa, a demanding, driving bundle of energy in midfield to whom others turn. Scored the breakthrough goal in the Cup tie against West Brom and needs a similar impact here. Fabian Delph is the beating heart of Villa . Ciaran Clark . The 25-year-old has grown in stature this season for Villa, a vocal presence at the back and thoroughly committed. He will be the defender to put in a tackle of substance to get the fans cheering. Charlie Austin . Has now scored 16 Premier League goals this season, a remarkable tally in his debut campaign. Will look to get on the end of any opportunities in the area and has movement to trouble. Joey Barton . Was at his snarling best against West Brom, tackling and passing to dominate midfield. Picked up his eighth booking in ten games but is available against Villa. Much depends on how much he imposes himself. Joey Barton's midfield menace is key for QPR . Bobby Zamora . Produced probably the best goal of his career aged 34 at the Hawthorns and has rested up since. His aching limbs mean training is minimal. But on the pitch he can provide a focal point to attacks and win plenty in the air.",

An 86-year-old nun was reportedly gang-raped before being murdered in her bedroom at a South African missionary. Gertrud Tiefenbacher's hands had been tied with a typewriter cord and a towel placed over a face, say local police. Her body was found by other nuns at the Sacred Heart Missionary in Ixopo, a small town 85 miles south-west of Durban. Police in KwaZulu-Natal are waiting for the results of forensic tests to confirm that Sister Gertrud was sexually assaulted. They say she was suffocated but they are unsure how many men attacked her. A small sum of money - thought to be in euros - had been stolen from her room. The victim's friend Betty Firmstone, 85, told South Africa's\u00a0Daily News: 'I met Sister in 1952 when I started teaching at a school attached to the mission.\u00a0We worked very closely together. She loved her work with children. 'This really was an act of savagery against a gentle, caring soul.' Sister Gertrud had lived at the missionary for 60 years after moving to South Africa from her native Austria. Police spokesman Major Thulani Zwane said there were no signs of forced entry into the room - and the number of intruders was 'unclear'. 'It is alleged that the victim was at her residence when she was approached by a suspect who allegedly tied her hands with a typewriter cord,' he added. 'She was also covered with a towel over her face, causing the victim to suffocate. Rape is also suspected in this matter. 'We are following all leads. We are also appealing to the community to come forward with any information.' Nuns at the mission where the murdered sister lived have been serving the local community since 1923 . The attack at the weekend is the first to be reported at the mission, which opened in 1923 for nuns wanting to serve the local community. It is also a home for young women who are considering becoming nuns. Sister Gerald, who lives at the mission, said Sister Gertrud had dedicated her life to helping impoverished children and adolescents. Despite her advanced age, she was working for the mission's educational outreach programme at the time of her murder. 'She had a very kind heart and was loved by everyone,' said Sister Gerald.",

Johnson, 27, has been bailed to appear before Peterlee magistrates on May 20 \u2014 the same day Sunderland travel to Arsenal \u2014 where it is expected the case will be sent to the Crown Court. If found guilty, Johnson faces a lengthy prison term. Sunderland chiefs held talks on Thursday to decide Johnson\u2019s future, knowing that if they suspend their top scorer he would miss the club\u2019s remaining six games. They are just a point above the Barclays Premier League drop zone and travel to Stoke tomorrow. Adam Johnson leaves Peterlee police station after being charged with three offences of sexual activity . Johnson leaves the Peterlee police station after learning of the charges against him . The 27-year-old looks on during Sunderland's 1-0 Premier League win against Newcastle earlier this month . Johnson was suspended by the club after his arrest on March 2 but that was lifted when his bail was extended by five weeks a fortnight later. He returned to training under new boss Dick Advocaat and has featured as a substitute in Sunderland\u2019s last three matches, including the 1-0 derby win over Newcastle. The suspension could now be reimposed. Johnson is accused of three offences of sexual activity with a child, contrary to\u00a0Section 9 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003. The offences are alleged to have taken place between December 30 last year and February 26. Johnson has also been charged with meeting a child following sexual grooming under Section 15 of the same Act. Gerry Wareham, CPS chief Crown prosecutor for the North East, said: \u2018Following an investigation by Durham Police, I have today authorised police to charge Adam Johnson, aged 27, with four offences under the Sexual Offences Act 2003.

        "article": "The couple that models designer clothes together stays together\u00a0\u2014 or at least that's what one New York-based duo hope, having just inked a deal as the first openly gay couple with Fusion Models. John Tuite, 22, and Carlos\u00a0Santolalla, 25, go by the Brangelina-like portmanteau\u00a0Jarlos, and have already earned a following in the modeling world and on New York City's party scene. But while the male model It Couple have starred in a campaign together for DKNY and posed for big brands like Edun and DSquared2, they say it hasn't always been easy for them to work in the industry and be true to themselves. Model couple: Carlos Santolalla, 25, left, and John Tuite, 22, right, are the first openly gay couple to be signed together to a modeling agency . Though the fashion industry seems very accepting of gay people, the couple explains that models are still expected to appear masculine or androgynous. Both John and Carlos had to drop their old agencies after they were told to act straight and delete the Instagram account they share, where they often post loving images of themselves kissing and hugging. 'After coming out, I didn\u2019t want to be weird about it again and act straight at castings,' John told\u00a0The Cut\u00a0in December. 'The weird thing about models \u2014 something that nobody really realizes \u2014 is that they\u2019re all straight,' Carlos recently told\u00a0Out magazine. Growing fan base: On Instagram, the couple goes by the joint nickname Jarlos, and they have over 22,500 followers . Facing obstacles: John and Carlos were told by their previous modeling agencies to act more 'butch' and delete their joint Instagram account, where they often pose kissing and holding hands . 'There is an unspoken rule of modeling, at least in NYC \u2014 even if you get signed as an out model \u2014 the first thing any agent tells you to do is to dress butch and talk about girls so no one \"finds out\",' John added. In fact, when the couple first got together over three years after meeting at a casting call, it was because\u00a0Carlos became interested in John when he realized he might be gay\u00a0\u2014 which he says was unusual. Soon the pair became well-known on the New York City party scene, getting snapped with celebrities like model Gigi Hadid and Paris Hilton, DJing at trendy clubs, and even curating art shows. 'We used to sneak into parties we weren\u2019t invited to at all and try to take pictures of famous people,' John said. 'Now we\u2019re invited and covering it and DJing.' Looking good: The couple explained that though the modeling industry is filled with well-groomed, well-dressed men, most male models are straight . Party hard: Jarlos is well known on the New York party circuit and has been pictured with Gigi Hadid, Paris Hilton, and Harry Styles . The fact that the pair has become so widely known as a couple made them even more appealing to Fusion Models. 'We signed them as a duo because they are both models and they DJ as a duo, under the name Jarlos,' Fusion's Alexandra Phipps told\u00a0Dazed. 'They\u2019ve made a name for themselves as a team, so we decided to run with it.' As for John and Carlos, they are as excited to be making strides for gay models as they are to have signed this new deal. 'Finally being represented as an openly gay man, let alone a couple, is a huge milestone for the industry, and the whole gay community,' John said. 'We hope that this will send a message to younger generations that it's possible to succeed without compromising who you are.'",

        "article": "A bedlington lurcher named Twiglet suffered a 'serious hallucinogenic episode' after accidentally eating a stash of drugs he found at a village bus stop. Vet Nick Fisher, 31, from Leintwardine, Shropshire, said  Twiglet was left behaving strangely after swallowing the unidentified substance while on a walk near their home last Monday. The four-year-old hound seemed to think he was being chased and had dilated pupils and bloodshot eyes after eating the drugs near the village bus stop. Vet Nick Fisher, 31, from Leintwardine, Shropshire, said his bedlington lurcher Twiglet (pictured) was left behaving strangely after eating the drugs he found at a bus stop while on a walk near their home last Monday . Twiglet seemed to think he was being chased and had dilated pupils and bloodshot eyes after eating the drug . But after 45 minutes of drooling at the mouth uncontrollably, shaking and walking into walls Twiglet seemed back to normal following his 'trip'. Today Mr Fisher, a veterinary surgeon, said: 'We had been taking Twiglet out for a walk as we normally do. 'We went past the bus stop which is just like a seat around an oak tree. 'A few people often hang out there and drop things like food and so on, so the dogs like to go scavenging around that area. 'He came back in the house and lay down and was tired as you might expect. 'But then he got up and started running around, doing laps of the room as if he was being chased. The bus stop in\u00a0Leintwardine, Shorpshire, where Twiglet found and consumed the unidentified narcotics . After  drooling at the mouth uncontrollably, shaking and walking into walls he seems to be back to normal . 'He had his tail between his legs and his head down, which he only does when he is being chased around by our other dogs. 'When I got hold of him he started shaking uncontrollably, producing huge quantities of saliva and panting excessively. 'He then lost his balance on the laminate flooring and fell onto his side. 'My wife was obviously quite upset. She's never seen a dog go through anything neurological before. Let alone tripping on drugs. 'I just reacted instinctively and had to treat him like any client's dog. I took step back and tried to remain calm.' Because of Twiglet's symptoms Mr Fisher believes his dog may have ingested something hallucinogenic . The father-of-one said he phoned the nurse at his surgery in Ludlow, Shropshire, to come and take a blood sample and made Twiglet vomit. The blood test did not show any obvious medical cause but a veterinary neurologist believed the illness to have been caused by narcotics. He added: 'The next day he was completely back to normal - although his eyes were very red. 'I've got a friend who is a neurologist so I asked them what they thought it was. 'Because of the circumstances and symptoms they suggested it sounded like he'd ingested something hallucinogenic. 'For a dog with no history of having any neurological issues to behave like this for a short period is usually related to drugs. Twiglet's scavenging days would appear to be over following the unfortunate incident last week . 'He would have been quite an unlucky dog to have had all those symptoms and for it to be anything else. 'It's not a common diagnosis around our village but there is a bit of a hippie commune up the road. Maybe something was dropped or had fallen out of someone's pocket. 'I have only seen one similar case in which we found a dog had swallowed a bag of marijuana - we just want other owners to be careful in future.' Wife Karen, 33, a farm consultant, added: 'It led to a 45 minute episode in which Twiglet showed symptoms of being under the influence of narcotics. 'Symptoms include hallucinating, partial seizures, tremors, hyper salivating, in-coordination and collapsing. 'We want to make other owners aware to be vigilant when walking their dogs in the area.' The vet is urging dog owners to be vigilant while walking pets in the area in case a similar incident occurs .",

        "article": "A bill that would make Hawaii the first state to raise the legal smoking age to 21 cleared the Legislature on Friday and is headed to the governor. The bill would prevent adolescents from smoking, buying or possessing both traditional and electronic cigarettes. Governor David Ige hasn't yet decided whether he will sign the bill and said he will not review it until it is vetted by his staff for any legal issues, as is the case with all bills. 'The departments will be doing their review and then we'll have the opportunity to look at it,' Ige said. Jessica Yamauchi, executive director of the Coalition for a Tobacco-Free Hawaii, called the legislation 'groundbreaking'. Jessica Yamauchi, executive director of the Coalition for a Tobacco Free Hawaii, called the legislation that could raise Hawaii's smoking age to 21 'groundbreaking'. The bill was recently passed by the state legislature . 'It's amazing to be the first state in something. That's very exciting for us.' The bill includes a $10 fine for first-time offenders. Subsequent violations would lead to a $50 fine or mandatory community service. Dozens of local governments have similar bans, including Hawaii County and New York City. According to the state Department of Heath, 5,600 kids in Hawaii try smoking each year, and 90 percent of daily smokers begin the habit before age 19. Meanwhile, 1,400 people die from tobacco use or exposure in Hawaii every year, according to the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. 'Today we have the opportunity to change the paradigm,' said Democratic state Sen. Rosalyn Baker, who introduced the bill. The new bill will apply to both traditional cigarettes and electronic cigarettes (file photo) Smoking prevalence would fall an estimated 12 percent if the minimum smoking age was raised to 21, according to a report by the Institute of Medicine, which is part of the National Academy of Sciences. The favorite flavors among teens who use electronic cigarettes are sweet tart and 'unicorn puke, which is described as a combination of every flavor of Skittle in one,' Baker said. 'While the industry is not allowed to directly market to children, it is still developing packaging and advertising products in ways that appeal to children,' she said. Sabrina Olaes, 17, got involved in promoting the legislation after finding herself in restrooms full of electronic cigarette fumes when her classmates vaped at her high school. 'You feel like you want to hold your breath because you don't want to smell what they're smoking,' Olaes said. 'It's pretty sad to know that they've fallen under the addiction.' Opponents say it's unfair that a military veteran returning from service could be prevented from smoking. 'It is not right because you are deemed an adult when you turn 18,' said Michelle Johnston, owner of Sub Ohm Vapes in Kailua-Kona, on Hawaii's Big Island. 'You can sign up and be in the military and basically give your life for your country. You can vote,' she said. 'Why shouldn't you be able to choose if you want to buy tobacco products or vaping products, when you're considered a legal adult?' Democratic Senator Gil Riviere, who voted against the bill in the 19-4 vote, said if the state wants to eliminate smoking, it should ban it for everyone. 'You can sign contracts, you can get married, you can go to war and lose an arm or lose an eye... you come back and you're 20 years old and you can't have a cigarette,' Riviere said.

        "article": "More than 2,000 families have fled the Iraqi city of Ramadi after ISIS forces intensified their offensive on the Iraqi city. According to Iraqi officials, ISIS fighters have nearly surrounded the capital of western Anbar province, despite the best efforts of the Iraqi army and arriving Shiite paramilitary reinforcements. The advance is widely seen as an ISIS's attempt at an counteroffensive after being forced to abandon the important Iraqi city of Tikrit, earlier this month. American troops previously fought some of their bloodiest battles against al-Qaida insurgents in Ramadi during the eight-year U.S. intervention. Prior to the current bout of fighting, some 400,000 Iraqis were already displaced, including 60,000 in Ramadi district, according to the International Organization for Migration. Hundreds of U.S. troops have been training Iraqi forces at Ain al-Asad military base, situated west of Ramadi. Iraqi government forces still control the city center but appear to be struggling after months of ISIS pressure from the suburbs of the city. Video obtained by The Associated Press showed plumes of thick, black smoke billowing above the city as fighter jets pounded militant targets.  On the city outskirts, displaced residents frantically tried to make their way out amid the heavy bombardment. Officials confirmed that US led coalition air strikes had targeted the three villages recently taken by ISIS on Wednesday. More than 2,000 families have fled the Iraqi city of Ramadi with little more than the clothes on their backs, turning the city into a ghost town. Hundreds of U.S. troops have reportedly been training units of Iraqi forces at a military base, located west of Ramadi. Supplies including tents and food has already been dispatched to the terrified families, now living in difficult conditions in the suburbs of Baghdad. Fleeing residents now in Baghdad said that Ramadi resembled an ghost town. Anbar's deputy governor, Faleh al-Issawi, described the situation in Ramadi as \"catastrophic\" and urged the central government to send in reinforcements. \"We urge the Baghdad government to supply us immediately with troops and weapons in order to help us prevent the city from falling into the hands of the IS group,\" he told the Associated Press in a telephone interview. Ramadi was once the battlefield for US forces eight year battle against insurgents during the 2003 Iraq war. Since ISIS captured Fallujah over a year ago, it has been targeting Ramadi. Shiite paramilitary groups and further Iraqi army reinforcements are expected to arrive in the coming days to try and prevent ISIS from taking Ramadi. Iraqi forces have been assisted by US led coalition air strikes, which targeted three villages recently captured by ISIS. Stephane Dujarric,spokesman for the U.N. secretary-general, said access to the city was limited but humanitarian workers were trying to verify the reports of fleeing residents. Prior to the current bout of fighting, some 400,000 Iraqis were already displaced, including 60,000 in Ramadi district, according to the International Organization for Migration. Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, who was visiting Washington on Wednesday, did not mention fears surrounding Ramadi. Instead he praised the 5,000 Sunni tribal fighters who have reportedly enlisted to help defend Ramadi and other strategic towns in Anbar province. If Ramadi does fall to ISIS, it would be the first major Iraqi city to be taken by the extremist group since militants seized Mosul in June 2014.

The Scottish First Minister, whose party is on course for a landslide north of the border, said the Labour leader would soon \u2018change his tune\u2019. Mr Miliband yesterday insisted he would not agree to a \u2018confidence and supply\u2019 deal with the SNP, who look set to deprive his party of an outright win and could hold the balance of power. Scroll down for video . Could hold the balance of power: Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon (left), whose party is on course for a landslide north of the border, said Labour leader Ed Miliband (right) would soon \u2018change his tune\u2019 Religious visit: Mr Miliband and his wife Justine meet Hindu devotees at the Shree Swaminarayan Temple in Willesden Green, north-west London, yesterday . But he again refused to rule out relying on SNP votes to pass key legislation. Critics said that would mean a weak Labour government having to negotiate day in, day out with SNP MPs. Miss Sturgeon has previously ruled out a formal coalition, but said she will seek to put Mr Miliband in No 10 even if Labour finishes 40 seats behind the Conservatives in a hung Parliament. Yesterday a YouGov/Sunday Times poll suggested the SNP could win 46 of Scotland\u2019s 59 seats \u2013 up from just six at present. Miss Sturgeon told LBC Radio: \u2018What Ed Miliband has got to recognise [is that] in a minority parliament, he won\u2019t have the votes simply to say that he is going to do what he likes come what may. Balancing act: Miss Sturgeon visits Jump Gymnastics community club in Cumbernauld, North Lanarkshire . 'Economic risk': London Mayor Boris Johnson (left) told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show that there is 'no way Miliband (right) could conceivably govern except with the help of the SNP' \u2018He is trying to continue to pretend that he is going to have a majority, and he is in danger, I think, of giving the impression that he doesn\u2019t have very much respect for democracy, or for the votes of the Scottish people. Ramped up warnings:\u00a0Home Secretary Theresa May . \u2018If the verdict of the people is to give neither of the big parties a majority ... my message to Ed Miliband remains as it has always been \u2013 if we have got an anti-Tory majority, if we work together, we can lock the Tories out.\u2019 The Conservatives yesterday ramped up their warnings over a Labour-SNP deal. Home Secretary Theresa May said Britain would face its gravest constitutional crisis since the 1936 abdication of Edward VIII. She added that English voters would not accept Scottish MPs having power over crucial issues in their lives. And London Mayor Boris Johnson told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show: \u2018There is no way Miliband could conceivably govern except with the help of the SNP \u2013 they\u2019d be crouching on his back like a monkey. 'The SNP pushing him even further to the Left would be a real economic risk for this country.\u2019 Asked on the Andrew Marr Show if he thought he could win the election in Scotland, despite polls putting Labour more than 20 points behind, Mr Miliband said: \u2018I think we can.\u2019 He said he had \u2018made it clear we\u2019re not interested\u2019 in deals, such as a \u2018confidence and supply\u2019 arrangement where the SNP would agree to back Labour on important votes such as the Budget. But he refused to rule out relying on SNP votes for key legislation. David Cameron yesterday rejected criticism of the Tories\u2019 warnings over a Labour-SNP pact, telling Sky News: \u2018It is the right and responsible thing to point out the dangers of that.\u2019 Nicola Sturgeon's party: SNP candidates have issued blood-curdling threats in recent weeks . SNP candidates have vowed to produce the British Establishment\u2019s \u2018worst nightmare\u2019 if they get into power with Labour. In a series of campaign videos and speeches, a string of SNP candidates have issued blood-curdling threats in recent weeks \u2013 and warned that they will push Ed Miliband even further to the Left. Tommy Sheppard, the party\u2019s candidate in Edinburgh East, boasted that last year\u2019s independence referendum \u2018sent the British Establishment a message and gave them a shock\u2019, adding: \u2018On May 7 we can visit on them their worst nightmare.\u2019 Mr Sheppard said the SNP would force Westminster to \u2018march to the rhythm of the people of Scotland\u2019. He also praised Labour\u2019s notorious 1983 manifesto, dubbed the \u2018longest suicide note in history\u2019, saying it contained \u2018a lot of good thinking\u2019. Martin Docherty, SNP candidate for West Dunbartonshire, suggested the party would use power to take revenge for the way Scotland has been \u2018treated\u2019 by England over centuries. John Nicolson, the party\u2019s candidate in East Dunbartonshire, confirmed the SNP would use its influence to force Labour to scrap the replacement of Britain\u2019s Trident nuclear deterrent. And Chris Law, SNP candidate for Dundee West, said: \u2018My neighbour\u2019s house was burned down by the Suffragettes, so we know how to take radical action. I\u2019m not suggesting that you send me to London\u2026 we\u2019ve been there before with Guy Fawkes. 'But if I\u2019m elected to Westminster I\u2019m going to make sure there\u2019s fire in my belly, a loud voice and a strong fight to hold their feet to the fire for a roasting.\u2019 Conservative vice-chairman Bob Neill said the \u2018dangerous\u2019 comments underlined the threat posed by allowing the SNP to share power at Westminster. Mr Neill said: \u2018Their demands would never end and we would all pay for their economic chaos.

The sight of Liam Plunkett and Mark Wood impressing in the nets here on Sunday, and Moeen Ali bowling apparently without discomfort after joining the squad, was a reminder that England have options for the second Test which starts on Tuesday. It would be harsh to blame the bowlers for their inability to take the eight wickets they needed on the final day of the Antigua Test because they threw everything at West Indies on a pitch that refused to deteriorate. Liam Plunkett, pictured with Chris Jordan, is pushing for a place in England's attack for the second Test . Mark Wood (pictured) and Plunkett impressed in the nets on Sunday ahead of the second match of the series . Yet there is no doubting that they were missing an X-factor, with strike bowlers Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad down on pace and England refusing to gamble on the inconsistent leg-spin of Adil Rashid. Chris Jordan was the fastest bowler in the first Test, clocked at 91mph, and while it would be a huge surprise if England dropped either Anderson or Broad, there is a case for Plunkett or the impressive Wood to feature. \u2018Over the next 12 months we are going to need a squad of bowlers who can win us Test matches,\u2019 said vice-captain Ian Bell after England\u2019s first look at the National Stadium here. \u2018Both Wood and Plunkett are bowling with really good pace and that\u2019s important with so many Test matches to come.\u2019 Moeen Ali has joined up with the England squad after missing the first Test in Antigua through injury . Moeen provides an option for the England selectors while Jonathan Trott appeared in good spirits on Sunday . If Moeen convinces England he is fully fit after recovering from a side injury he will probably replace James Tredwell, who took five wickets in the first Test but is now nursing a shoulder injury. That would add even more depth to an England middle order who all contributed in Antigua, with either Moeen, Ben Stokes or Jos Buttler batting as low as eight on the spice island.

Fifteen years ago, Jennifer Lopez' shimmering, navel-baring Versace gown captivated the world. So much so that, long before Kim Kardashian was breaking the internet, J Lo's 2000 red carpet appearance set the web ablaze. It even caught the attention of Google executive, Eric Schmidt, who has revealed that the plunging dress was his inspiration for creating Google Images. 'When Google was launched, people were amazed that they were able to find out about almost anything by typing just a few words into a computer,' he told project-syndicate.com. Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin \u2013 like all other successful inventors \u2013 kept iterating, said Schmidt. They started with images, because people wanted more than just text. 'This first became apparent after the 2000 Grammy Awards, where Jennifer Lopez wore a green dress that, well, caught the world's attention,' added Schmidt. 'At the time, it was the most popular search query we had ever seen. 'But we had no surefire way of getting users exactly what they wanted: J Lo wearing that dress. Google Image Search was born.' Before Google Image Search, web surfers could only search through a page of text divided by 10 blue links. This meant they first had to click on these links before finding out if J Lo's dress was featured. When Google Images was launched in July 2001, the site offered access to 250 million images. Just ten year later, that figure reached more than 10 billion. The dress is one of the few articles of specific clothing to be honoured its own Wikipedia page. After hearing the news, the 45-year-old singer shared an old picture of her in that dress on Instagram. She added: 'WHO KNEW!! #onepersoncanchangetheworld #onedresscanchangetheworld #jlo+versace=history #positivechange #funfacts LOL' The dress caught the attention of Google executive, Eric Schmidt (pictured), who recently revealed that it was his inspiration for creating Google Images . Google has big plans for its image search.\u00a0A team of Google researchers recently developed an advanced image classification and detection algorithm called GoogLeNet, which is twice as effective than previous programs. It is so accurate it can locate and distinguish between a range of object sizes within a single image, and it can also determine an object within, or on top of, an object, within the photo. The software recently placed first in the ImageNet large-scale visual recognition challenge (ILSVRC). Google has made the software open to other developers, to help increase its accuracy, and in the future, the technology could be used to improve Google Image searches. It could also scour YouTube videos for specific objects or shapes. He may have helped to build the internet, but Dr Vinton \u2018Vint\u2019 Cerf has urged computer users to print out their most treasured photographs, or risk losing them. The Google vice president warned that as operating systems and software become more sophisticated, documents and images stored using older technology will become increasingly inaccessible. He went on to say that our dependence on technology could lead to the 21st century being a new dark age in history, with any evidence of our culture lost in a digital 'black hole'. In centuries to come, future historians looking back on the current era could be confronted by a digital desert comparable with the dark ages - the post-Roman period in Western Europe about which relatively little is known because of the scarcity of written records. Dr Cerf, who also has the title of Chief Internet Evangelist at Google, said: \u2018If we\u2019re thinking 1,000 years, 3,000 years ahead in the future, we have to ask ourselves, how do we preserve all the bits that we need in order to correctly interpret the digital objects we create? \u2018We are nonchalantly throwing all of our data into what could become an information black hole without realising it.'",

Schoolchildren from Belgium sit on a tank as an Israeli soldier gives a brief history of the country's wars, near the Armored Corps memorial . In recent years the remembrance day has been expanded beyond commemorating those soldiers killed defending Israel, but also security personnel who died protecting the state from terrorist attacks. According to the Israeli ministry of defence, 116 security force personnel have been killed in the line of duty, over the past year alone. In total, Israel remembers 23,320 fallen since 1860 in fighting for the national cause. On television, one of the state channels screens the names of all the deceased in chronological order over the course of the day. That year, 1860, is when Israel considers to be the start of the conflict with the Palestinians when Jews founded the first neighbourhood outside the walls of Jerusalem's Old City. In addition, 2,538 civilians have been killed in political violence since 1950, including 122 foreign visitors, according to National Insurance Institute figures. Remembrance ceremonies began at sunset on Tuesday and continue until nightfall on Wednesday when the sombre mood gives way to raucous celebrations marking 67 years since the declaration of the Israeli state on May 14, 1948.

New figures released ahead of Independence Day by the Central Bureau of Statistics showed Israel's population now stands at 8,345,000. Of that number, 6,251,000 or 74.9 percent are Jews and 1,730,000 or 20.7 percent are Arabs. The remaining 340,000 listed as 'other' comprise non-Arab Christians, members of other religions and those unclassified in the population register. The figures include around 310,000 Palestinian residents of east Jerusalem, which Israel captured in the Six-Day War of 1967 and later annexed in a move not recognised by the international community.

Five children were questioned by police after 623 fires ravaged 600 acres of fields and woodland this month alone. Fire crews in South Wales say they have been stretched to breaking point by the \u2018unprecedented\u2019 scale of destruction, which is mainly being blamed on gangs of youngsters. Five children have been questioned after 623 fires ravaged 600 acres of fields and woodland in one month . Officers yesterday called on parents to report their children if they suspect them of lighting fires. Deputy Chief Constable Matt Jukes, of South Wales Police, said: \u2018It is only a matter of time before somebody gets seriously injured or even killed. \u2018What is most concerning is that we believe that many of these grass fires are being caused by children. This must be addressed and everybody can do their bit.\u2019 \u2018Teachers, neighbours, shop owners, but most importantly parents or carers have a role to play and can make a stand against this recurring problem.\u2019 DCC Jukes added: \u2018The sad reality is that because of the na\u00efve and reckless actions of some of the youngest members of the community, the lives of those who need the emergency services most are being put at serious risk.\u2019 From Friday morning to Monday evening, emergency services took more than 1,600 calls for grass fires. Gordon Shumack, of Crimestoppers Wales, said: \u2018The valleys are turning black again as a result of these fires being deliberately started.\u2019 The cost of fighting the blazes, which devastated wildlife, has risen close to \u00a3500,000 since the month began. Fire chief Stephen Rossiter said: \u2018The natural terrain of mountains is very dangerous underfoot, and more so when we are fighting grass fires \u2013 even for our best-trained people.\u2019 South Wales: Gordon Shumack said the valleys were turning black as a result of the deliberately started fires . \u2018It is quite possible a house will catch fire if the incidents continue. People lighting them need to understand the danger they can cause.\u2019 The arrested 11-year-old was given \u2018stern\u2019 advice by police. Four suspects aged 12 to 14 were released on bail. It comes as the dry and sunny weather has left heathlands especially vulnerable to fast spreading fire. Meanwhile a blaze which ravaged the Pirbright Army ranges in Surrey was yesterday still smouldering nearly a week after it began. Conservation experts say that the area could take ten years to recover. A man, 33, has been arrested and released on bail over the fire.",

This weekend brings with it arguably Saints' biggest match of the season, with the visit of Tottenham likely to be key in the fight for European qualification. Mauricio Pochettino's first return to St Mary's adds extra spice to a match, ahead of which his successor felt the need to hold a team meeting to refocus his players' minds. Ronald Koeman says his Southampton players must remain focused on European qualification . Koeman spoke to Victor Wanyama and his other players to refocus them on the last five league games . Wanyama's claims that Arsenal were interested in his services were the catalyst and, while defending the 23-year-old by saying the story was 'bull****', Koeman called for his players to show more common sense. 'You know always in the last part of the season there are rumours talking about interest in players,' the Saints boss said. 'I don't like to say every time it's true or it's not true. 'It's important that everybody knows his position in the club. They have contracts - you can't talk about moving because you have a contract. That's not respectful to the club. 'We spoke about that, that we need that focus. If we don't have really that focus, we can't bring the level what we normally bring this season.' Such speculation about the likes of Wanyama, Nathaniel Clyne and Morgan Schneidelin brings back memories of last summer's talent drain from St Mary's. Wanyama's future came under question after an interview where he seemed to hint at a move to Arsenal . Koeman has repeatedly insisted a similar situation will not arise this time around, although he is wise enough to know the south-coast club's place in the food chain. 'On one side it's normal because, okay, we are Southampton,' Koeman said. 'We are not Man United, because they are always talking about new players, and normally in teams like Southampton, a little bit more down, they are talking about interest in players of Southampton. 'We know that, but it's up to the press. They can write and they can say what they want, but no problem. 'We have to keep that spirit together and that was my message to the players. 'We can't do anything about that. You have to look out if they ask you that kind of questions. That's your job. There has also been speculation about the futures of Morgan Schneiderlin (left) and Nathaniel Clyne . Southampton come up against former boss Mauricio Pochettino on Saturday in the race for the Europa League . 'You're not a young kid. You have to respond, and if you respond you have to know what you respond.' Koeman says he will not be enforcing a media ban to keep his players out of trouble - something he accepts is more difficult now given the power held by agents. The former Holland international also understands the ambitions his players may well harbour, admitting he spoke out of turn a few times when he was younger. 'Of course, when I played in Holland, okay, I was looking to play in a bigger team - that's normal,' Koeman said. 'If you are not really in the highest level and you get opportunities to play in a higher level, okay, you like it, of course. Everybody likes the best. 'Everybody likes to play Champions League football - that's normal. I'm not surprised about that.'",

        "article": "Aaron Hernandez saw his PCP-taking friends kill Odin Lloyd but did not commit the murder himself, his defense claimed in the closing arguments of his trial on Tuesday. 'Did he make all the right decisions? No,' defense attorney James Sultan said. 'He was a 23-year-old kid who witnessed... a shocking killing committed by somebody he knew. He really didn't know what to do. So he just put one foot in front of the other.' After closing arguments from the defense and the prosecution, the jury began their deliberations on Tuesday afternoon.\u00a0If convicted, Hernandez faces a maximum penalty of life in prison. The former New England Patriots football player, 25, has pleaded not guilty to murder and firearms charges in the death of Lloyd, a semiprofessional football player who was dating his fianc\u00e9e's sister. Scroll down for video . On trial: Aaron Hernandez is seen in court on Tuesday as his attorney shows a video of his home before closing arguments. His defense argued that he witnessed the killing of a friend but did not commit it himself . Defiant: Defense attorney James Sultan holds a photo of the murder scene during closing arguments . Prosecutor William McCauley points to Hernandez on Tuesday as he told jurors to simply look at the evidence . Prosecutors say the former tight end and two friends, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, picked up Lloyd at his Boston home before dawn on June 17, 2013, and drove him to an industrial park near Hernandez's house in North Attleboro, Massachusetts, where they shot him to death. Surveillance video at Hernandez's home minutes after the shooting showed him holding a black item that appeared to be a gun. A joint found near Lloyd's body had Hernandez's and Lloyd's DNA on it. Murdered: Semi-pro football player, Odin Lloyd, was shot dead near Hernandez's home in June 2013 . Cellphone records shared in court also showed the men communicating with Lloyd that night. Surveillance video along the way showed Hernandez driving the Nissan shortly before Lloyd's sister saw him get into a silver car, a moment captured on a neighbor's security camera. Soon after, a toll booth camera caught the Nissan leaving Boston, while Lloyd's phone pinged several cell towers before stopping in North Attleborough for good. His body was found in an industrial park less than a mile from Hernandez's home later that day. Lloyd had been shot six times. In his closing arguments, Assistant District Attorney William McCauley told jurors  to go through all the evidence. 'If you do that, you'll get to where you need to go, which is to find the defendant guilty for the murder of Odin Lloyd,' McCauley said. But the defense said the prosecution's case failed to prove Hernandez pulled the trigger. Prosecutors have never presented a motive to jurors and Sultan added on Monday that Hernandez and Lloyd were friends who shared 'a passion for marijuana'. 'Obviously they were friends,' Sultan told the jury. 'They were future brothers-in-law.' Wallace and Ortiz have also pleaded not guilty to murder charges and will be tried separately. Both men used the drug PCP, according to attorneys and court documents, and the defense team has sought to link use of the drug with violent, unpredictable behavior in an apparent attempt to shift blame for the murder on the pair. Blame game: Attorneys from the defense team said\u00a0Carlos Ortiz, left, and Ernest Wallace, right, were responsible for the murder - not Hernandez. DNA and surveillance footage ties all three to the scene . Support:\u00a0Shayanna Jenkins (left), Hernandez's girlfriend, and his mother Terri listen to the judge on Tuesday . Emotional: An uncle of Odin Lloyd is comforted as he hears details about his nephew's death on Tuesday . Investigators say Lloyd was shot multiple times with a Glock .45-caliber handgun that has not been found. Sultan said that after nine weeks of testimony, prosecutors 'still haven't proved to you who killed Odin Lloyd.'\u00a0During the trial, which started in late January, the prosecution called 131 witnesses while the defense called three. Sultan also attacked the investigation, saying a shell casing removed from a rental car returned by Hernandez had been contaminated with his client's DNA from a piece of chewing gum stuck to it. 'The investigation done in this case was incomplete, biased and inept. That was not fair to Odin Lloyd, that was not fair to Aaron Hernandez, and it was not fair to you,' he said. 'All that effort and this is all they could come up with. What does that tell you?' Eighteen jurors began the trial in January, but three were dismissed, including one who is accused of misrepresenting her answers during screening in a bid to get onto the jury. Hernandez had a $41 million contract with the Patriots. He was cut after being charged with Lloyd's killing in June 2013.
