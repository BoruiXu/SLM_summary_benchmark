Some of the items found included an armour-piercing improvised rocket and two anti-personnel mines. The main line of police inquiry is the arms belonged to dissident republicans. Last week, Home Secretary Theresa May said MI5 believed an attack on targets in Great Britain by dissident republicans had become \"a strong possibility\". Analysis: Vincent Kearney, BBC News NI's home affairs correspondent The discovery of what appears to be a second dissident republican arms dump near Larne within three months has left police baffled.

But the nature of what was found suggests otherwise and the finger of suspicion firmly in the direction of dissident republicans. Det Supt Kevin Geddes said the threat level in Northern Ireland from dissident republican groups remains \"severe\" and an attack is \"highly likely\". Police officers found three barrels hidden in holes in the forest. As well as rockets and mines, there were also several pipe bombs, assault rifle ammunition and parts to construct a \"substantial number of explosive devices\".

        "article": "A colony has been roosting in St Hilda's Church at Ellerburn, close to the North York Moors. But despite the church's best efforts the bats are not moving and are soiling the altar and church furniture, leaving the church with an \"appalling smell\". The creatures are protected by law and cannot be wilfully disturbed. Volunteers at the church have been working for the past decade to keep the altar, stonework and woodwork clean. But the bats, roosting in the higher areas of the church continually soil the interior of the building with urine and faeces. Church warden Liz Cowley said keeping the 11th Century building in good shape was difficult. She said: \"You can see the urine marks (on the altar), they won't go away. \"If people were coming in here damaging an ancient building like this, you would say it was criminal damage. \"The smell is appalling, it's a combination of ammonia from the urine and a musty smell from the droppings that catches at the back of the throat.\" Members of the church had spent \u00c2\u00a310,000 trying to get the bats to move and had paid for specially-built lofts nearby. The Rev Paul Mothersdale, the Rector of St Hilda's Church, said a lot of money had been invested in trying to persuade the bats to move out of the church. The Rev Mothersdale said: \"We've tried to do everything that English Nature, or Natural England, have wanted us to do. \"Money has been spent, not only by the congregation, not only out of church funds, but local people have mucked in and helped. \"And yet we're no further forward, we're still as we were 10 years ago.\" Lucy Bellini, of Natural England, said the bats had to be carefully monitored.

The police said that a post-mortem examination showed he died as a \"direct result of the injuries\" of the bomb. A dissident republican group, widely referred to as the new IRA, said it carried out the attack. The organisation said Mr Ismay was targeted for training officers at Maghaberry Prison near Lisburn, County Antrim.

He admitted culpable homicide on the basis of diminished responsibility after saying he had no recollection of the killing at Dixon Avenue, Glasgow, on 24 September last year. Buksh will be sentenced on 27 June. The High Court in Glasgow heard that 43-year-old Mrs Buksh died after being struck on the head at least five times. Pathologists told the court that the lack of defensive injuries and the position of her body suggested she was assaulted as she slept. Following the attack, Buksh went to Cathcart Police Station and told an officer: \"I've come to hand myself in. I think my wife's dead. I hit her on the head. I did it.\" The court was told that three psychiatrists described Buksh as suffering from an acute stress disorder at the time. Prosecutor Gordon Lamont said: \"The accused and his wife had been married for 25 years, but over the last 10 or 11 years their relationship appears to have broken down and they became increasingly estranged, albeit, still residing under the one roof. \"They slept separately and Mrs Buksh routinely slept on the sofa in the living room. Their children report that they barely spoke to each other.\" Mr Lamont said the problems in the marriage intensified after Mrs Buksh went to Pakistan on holiday in May last year. He said she had become involved with another man and was making plans to move to Pakistan. The court also heard that two days before he killed his wife, Buksh went to Paisley Police Office and spoke with a support officer saying he feared his wife was going to take their youngest child, aged 10, to Pakistan and not return. He also made an emergency doctor's appointment and said he was suffering from stress and not sleeping. He was prescribed medication for stress. Defence counsel Sarah Livingstone said: \"My client has no memory of this incident.

Buksh will be sentenced on 27 June. The High Court in Glasgow heard that 43-year-old Mrs Buksh died after being struck on the head at least five times. Pathologists told the court that the lack of defensive injuries and the position of her body suggested she was assaulted as she slept. Following the attack, Buksh went to Cathcart Police Station and told an officer: \"I've come to hand myself in. I think my wife's dead. I hit her on the head. I did it.\" The court was told that three psychiatrists described Buksh as suffering from an acute stress disorder at the time. Prosecutor Gordon Lamont said: \"The accused and his wife had been married for 25 years, but over the last 10 or 11 years their relationship appears to have broken down and they became increasingly estranged, albeit, still residing under the one roof. \"They slept separately and Mrs Buksh routinely slept on the sofa in the living room. Their children report that they barely spoke to each other.\" Mr Lamont said the problems in the marriage intensified after Mrs Buksh went to Pakistan on holiday in May last year. He said she had become involved with another man and was making plans to move to Pakistan. The court also heard that two days before he killed his wife, Buksh went to Paisley Police Office and spoke with a support officer saying he feared his wife was going to take their youngest child, aged 10, to Pakistan and not return. He also made an emergency doctor's appointment and said he was suffering from stress and not sleeping. He was prescribed medication for stress. Defence counsel Sarah Livingstone said: \"My client has no memory of this incident. His amnesia is absolutely genuine. \"This is not a case where this man was a bad husband, there was no domestic abuse. This was an unhappy marriage, but however, unhappy it was it didn't justify killing his wife. \"He suffered an acute stress reaction. Three psychiatrists all agree that he was suffering from an abnormality of the mind.\" Judge Lord Burns deferred sentence on Buksh until 27 June at the High Court in Edinburgh for background reports.",

Last week, a surprise late bid led by retail veteran Greg Tufnell transformed the race to acquire the retailer. His team, said to be backed by Portuguese money, is the front-runner. But if a deal cannot be struck, the business may still have to be liquidated. The remaining bidders have faded into the background. Another consortium led by Matalan tycoon John Hargreaves and Turkish retail entrepreneur Cafer Mahiroglu has reportedly run into difficulties, while other suitors have apparently failed to impress with their proposals. Some of those involved in the different bids have impressive retailing histories. But then Sir Philip Green, who controlled BHS from 2000 to 2015, also had a brilliant track record. And he ended up selling the business for \u00c2\u00a31. So what are the chances of saving BHS from the liquidators? And just who are the people aiming to do it? In the public eye, Greg Tufnell is easily overshadowed by his more famous brother Phil, the former England cricketer. But that could change if his bid for BHS is successful, because he hopes to become the firm's next chairman. And as far as his credentials for the job are concerned, the 54-year-old executive certainly talks the talk. He describes himself as \"a highly experienced managing director with Mothercare and Arcadia, a blend of entrepreneur, strategist and hands-on operator with significant commercial business turnaround, acquisition and fund-raising experience\". His record shows that he was buying and merchandising director at Next from 1991 to 1994. He then spent three years as managing director of menswear retailer Burton, part of the Arcadia group, followed by another three years as managing director of Mothercare. He currently appears to occupy a portfolio of different jobs, including the chairmanships of leather accessories brand Zatchels and recruitment consultancy hga Group. Earlier this month, he registered a new firm, Richess Group, at Companies House. Its other directors are Nick de Scossa, a Swiss banker, and Lisbon-based entrepreneur Jose Maria Soares Bento. Until Mr Tufnell's bid turned up, many observers had assumed that BHS would be snapped up by Matalan founder Mr Hargreaves. But it appears that the cost of a deal may have proved too high. Sources say Mr Hargreaves was asked to improve his offer and balked. Like Sir Philip Green, 71-year-old John Hargreaves also enjoys the life of the super-rich. He has an estimated fortune of \u00c2\u00a31bn, according to the Sunday Times Rich List. But in stark contrast to the ebullient Sir Philip, Mr Hargreaves is described by industry insiders as quiet-spoken, someone who shuns the limelight. Mr Hargreaves is no longer directly involved in the business he founded. He sold his 69% stake in Matalan in 2000, then in 2006 took it private through Missouri Bidco, a company 53.5% owned by him and his family.

Last week, a surprise late bid led by retail veteran Greg Tufnell transformed the race to acquire the retailer. His team, said to be backed by Portuguese money, is the front-runner. But if a deal cannot be struck, the business may still have to be liquidated. The remaining bidders have faded into the background. Another consortium led by Matalan tycoon John Hargreaves and Turkish retail entrepreneur Cafer Mahiroglu has reportedly run into difficulties, while other suitors have apparently failed to impress with their proposals.

In the public eye, Greg Tufnell is easily overshadowed by his more famous brother Phil, the former England cricketer. But that could change if his bid for BHS is successful, because he hopes to become the firm's next chairman.

He has an estimated fortune of \u00c2\u00a31bn, according to the Sunday Times Rich List. But in stark contrast to the ebullient Sir Philip, Mr Hargreaves is described by industry insiders as quiet-spoken, someone who shuns the limelight.

When no-one raises their hand, Mr Alexander launches into the full spiel. \"If you guys want to come around, I'll show you how this thing works,\" he says, gesturing to two ceiling-high columns of stainless steel filled with something resembling a mushy golden porridge. \"We mix up honey and water over there and we pump it through a hot water bath at 160 degrees [71C] in a stainless steel coil here. Each one produces about 50 to 75 gallons [227-340 litres] of mead a day,\" explains Mr Alexander. It's fair to say he is obsessed with mead. \"It's the quintessential local beverage - you can go anywhere in the world and find honey to make mead, and I think that's unique among alcoholic beverages,\" he gushes. After being introduced to the drink by a home brewer, Mr Alexander thought there were profits to be had in a commercial meadery. He founded Maine Mead Works in 2008, pouring his savings and money from friends and family into the business. His business has since grown, along with the popularity of mead in the US. It's now a seven-person operation that manufactures more than 7,500 cases a year, shipping them as far away as China. Mr Alexander is not the only one to have caught on to the commercial potential of mead. Vicky Rowe, the owner of mead information website GotMead, says interest in the product in the US has exploded in the past decade. \"We went from 30-40 meaderies making mead to somewhere in the vicinity of 250 in the last 10 years,\" she says. \"I like to say that everything old is new again - people come back to what was good once.\" Even visitors to Mr Alexander's meadery agree. Tour participant Dirk Heseman admitted that while Maine Mead Works was the first meadery he'd actually visited, he has noticed that mead \"is becoming more and more available - similar to cider\". Just this year, commercial meaderies in the US have banded together to form an industry group, the American Mead Makers Association, to better share information and encourage growth in the industry. But there's a lot of work that needs to be done to improve the image of a drink long associated with Renaissance fairs and medieval re-enactments. \"I think our number one challenge as an industry is awareness of what mead is,\" says Mr Alexander. \"You ask 10 people in a room if they've ever heard of mead, and two of them might say, 'yes', and only one of them has had a very positive experience.\" The mead of the past was often sweet, and didn't appeal to many drinkers",

A supermarket moved in to replace it and helped with the money too, putting the council on a firm financial footing. But that was four years ago and the crisis is a different one today. It's being experienced by all local authorities - cuts in central government funding which threaten the services they provide. Mr Rhodes is also deputy leader of Leicestershire County Council, with responsibility for finance. Leicestershire is historically the poorest funded council in the country because of a quirk of Whitehall recalculations, going back a quarter of a century since the poll tax, or community charge, was scrapped. At the moment councils get income from council tax, a share of the business rates, any income they generate themselves from services plus a grant from central government. It's the grant cut which is causing them grief. What's called the \"core funding\" is worked out by the number of homes multiplied by a set amount.

Freezing care provider fees to save money was no long sustainable, it said. Ministers say extra money will help NHS and social care services work together. The survey, which was completed by 147 directors of adult social services for councils in England, suggests that funding reductions to social care budgets have totalled \u00a34.6bn since 2010 - a 31% overall reduction. Budgets for adult social care - which provides practical support to people due to illness, disability, old age or a low income - will reduce by a further \u00a3500m in cash terms this year, it said. \"Taking the growth in numbers of older and disabled people into account, this means that an additional \u00a31.1bn would be needed to provide the same level of service as last year,\" the report warned. It said some councils had made savings in the past by freezing fees paid to providers, but care providers were now also facing financial problems. Some companies - particularly those in southern England - are struggling to attract staff, amid increasing concern about the quality of care, it said. \"What is at stake is the continuing capacity of adult social care to sustain services to those in greatest need,\" ADASS president Ray James said. \"In virtually all our authorities, the number in need is growing, while the complexity of their needs is increasing.\" ADASS called for the government to \"protect essential care and support services to the most vulnerable members of our community\". But a government spokesman said the survey \"ignores\" a commitment to invest \u00a310bn in health services that are being \"joined up\" with social care, by 2020. The BBC has launched an online guide to the care system for the over-65s. The \"care calculator\" covers residential care and the support provided in people's own homes, for tasks such as washing and dressing. Users can submit their postcode and find out how much each service costs where they live in the UK. There is also a dedicated BBC Cost of Care website, with news stories, analysis and video. The spokesman said: \"Increasing budgets isn't the only solution. By working innovatively and joining up health and social care we can improve care and also save money.\" However, Councillor Izzi Seccombe, from the Local Government Association (LGA), said adult social care services were facing \"enormous pressures\" due to \"insufficient funding, growing demand and escalating costs\". \"We have long warned that investing in the NHS whilst social care budgets are under continual pressure is simply a false economy. \"It is social care services that support elderly and vulnerable people to maintain their independence, live in their own community and stay out of hospital longer,\" she added.

Freezing care provider fees to save money was no long sustainable, it said. Ministers say extra money will help NHS and social care services work together. The survey, which was completed by 147 directors of adult social services for councils in England, suggests that funding reductions to social care budgets have totalled \u00a34.6bn since 2010 - a 31% overall reduction. Budgets for adult social care - which provides practical support to people due to illness, disability, old age or a low income - will reduce by a further \u00a3500m in cash terms this year, it said. \"Taking the growth in numbers of older and disabled people into account, this means that an additional \u00a31.1bn would be needed to provide the same level of service as last year,\" the report warned. It said some councils had made savings in the past by freezing fees paid to providers, but care providers were now also facing financial problems. Some companies - particularly those in southern England - are struggling to attract staff, amid increasing concern about the quality of care, it said. \"What is at stake is the continuing capacity of adult social care to sustain services to those in greatest need,\" ADASS president Ray James said. \"In virtually all our authorities, the number in need is growing, while the complexity of their needs is increasing.\" ADASS called for the government to \"protect essential care and support services to the most vulnerable members of our community\". But a government spokesman said the survey \"ignores\" a commitment to invest \u00a310bn in health services that are being \"joined up\" with social care, by 2020. The BBC has launched an online guide to the care system for the over-65s. The \"care calculator\" covers residential care and the support provided in people's own homes, for tasks such as washing and dressing. Users can submit their postcode and find out how much each service costs where they live in the UK. There is also a dedicated BBC Cost of Care website, with news stories, analysis and video. The spokesman said: \"Increasing budgets isn't the only solution. By working innovatively and joining up health and social care we can improve care and also save money.\" However, Councillor Izzi Seccombe, from the Local Government Association (LGA), said adult social care services were facing \"enormous pressures\" due to \"insufficient funding, growing demand and escalating costs\". \"We have long warned that investing in the NHS whilst social care budgets are under continual pressure is simply a false economy. \"It is social care services that support elderly and vulnerable people to maintain their independence, live in their own community and stay out of hospital longer,\" she added.

Freezing care provider fees to save money was no long sustainable, it said. Ministers say extra money will help NHS and social care services work together. The survey, which was completed by 147 directors of adult social services for councils in England, suggests that funding reductions to social care budgets have totalled \u00a34.6bn since 2010 - a 31% overall reduction. Budgets for adult social care - which provides practical support to people due to illness, disability, old age or a low income - will reduce by a further \u00a3500m in cash terms this year, it said. \"Taking the growth in numbers of older and disabled people into account, this means that an additional \u00a31.1bn would be needed to provide the same level of service as last year,\" the report warned. It said some councils had made savings in the past by freezing fees paid to providers, but care providers were now also facing financial problems. Some companies - particularly those in southern England - are struggling to attract staff, amid increasing concern about the quality of care, it said. \"What is at stake is the continuing capacity of adult social care to sustain services to those in greatest need,\" ADASS president Ray James said. \"In virtually all our authorities, the number in need is growing, while the complexity of their needs is increasing.\" ADASS called for the government to \"protect essential care and support services to the most vulnerable members of our community\". But a government spokesman said the survey \"ignores\" a commitment to invest \u00a310bn in health services that are being \"joined up\" with social care, by 2020. The BBC has launched an online guide to the care system for the over-65s. The \"care calculator\" covers residential care and the support provided in people's own homes, for tasks such as washing and dressing. Users can submit their postcode and find out how much each service costs where they live in the UK. There is also a dedicated BBC Cost of Care website, with news stories, analysis and video. The spokesman said: \"Increasing budgets isn't the only solution. By working innovatively and joining up health and social care we can improve care and also save money.\" However, Councillor Izzi Seccombe, from the Local Government Association (LGA), said adult social care services were facing \"enormous pressures\" due to \"insufficient funding, growing demand and escalating costs\". \"We have long warned that investing in the NHS whilst social care budgets are under continual pressure is simply a false economy. \"It is social care services that support elderly and vulnerable people to maintain their independence, live in their own community and stay out of hospital longer,\" she added. Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said the idea of a further \u00a31bn coming out of social care budgets was \"chilling\".

The gorse fire, which began at about 13:45 BST, has engulfed a large area of dry heath-land on Woodbury Common. Twenty fire engine crews were sent to tackle the flames that were fanned by high winds. The fire is being fought on a number of fronts and a police helicopter has been deployed to help survey the scene. Chief Fire Officer Lee Howell said it was a \"very difficult incident\" and his teams were struggling with wind direction and a lack of water supplies.

        "article": "GP practices are being paid to help local NHS groups limit the number of patient referrals and cut costs, the doctors' magazine Pulse found. Appointments affected include scans and consultations with specialists - including those for cancer patients. The British Medical Association said such incentives were \"misguided\". At least nine clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) were offering GP practices payments for hitting targets, according to Pulse's investigation. In one case, Birmingham South Central CCG was offering practices more than \u00c2\u00a311,000 to reduce new outpatient attendances, follow-ups, A&E attendances and emergency admissions by 1%, compared with 2014/15. It said the schemes, which exclude cancer referrals, were designed to \"incentivise best quality practice\" and \"drive improvements in the quality of primary medical care\". \"Our priority is to ensure that patients have access to services that they need, when they need them,\" said a spokesperson for Birmingham South Central CCG. Another CCG told Pulse it had considered the \"full impact\" of the incentive scheme and was \"confident that there is no conflict of interest\". Pulse said that one scheme had already been looked at by the General Medical Council, the body which regulates medical standards in the UK, after local GP leaders expressed their concern. The magazine pointed out that initial hospital referrals for cancer patients should happen within two weeks of a GP first suspecting the condition. Dr Chand Nagpaul, chairman of the GPs committee of the doctors' trade union the British Medical Association, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that such schemes were a \"financial contaminant\" to patient-doctor trust. He said: \"It's short-sighted and misguided of CCGs to introduce such mechanisms, because they do lead to the potential for patients questioning the motives of GP referrals. \"We believe it is far more appropriate for CCGs to introduce clinical pathways that ensure patients are referred appropriately rather than these crude, salesman-like bonuses which pay GPs simply to make reduction to referrals in numerical terms.\" Dr Peter Melton is local GP and clinical chief officer for North East Lincolnshire CCG, which offers the equivalent of more than \u00c2\u00a36,000 to practices that reduce outpatient referrals to the same level as the 25% with the lowest referral rates (which include two-week urgent cancer referrals) in 2014/15. He said the CCG was already among the best in England for referring suspected cancer patients to a consultant within two weeks and the scheme was not about avoiding sending people to hospital. \"It is not focussing on referral reduction per se but on better clinical and quality standards for the patient,\" he explained. \"The expectation is practices will be encouraged to investigate more locally and monitor the patient in the first instance rather than automatically refer in to a secondary care service.\" Analysis by the BBC's Helen Briggs The NHS is under pressure to make savings, with a target of carving out \u00c2\u00a322bn of efficiency savings by 2020. NHS leaders want to cut patient referrals that are deemed inappropriate, particularly when patients could be cared for locally.

It said the schemes, which exclude cancer referrals, were designed to \"incentivise best quality practice\" and \"drive improvements in the quality of primary medical care\". \"Our priority is to ensure that patients have access to services that they need, when they need them,\" said a spokesperson for Birmingham South Central CCG. Another CCG told Pulse it had considered the \"full impact\" of the incentive scheme and was \"confident that there is no conflict of interest\".

She doesn't give interviews - \"Hell, no\" was her response to a request several decades ago - and that silence has only added to the intrigue. But her close friend Thomas Lane Butts, a retired minister in her hometown, Monroeville, Alabama, says she once told him the reason. Sitting on a pew in the Methodist church which the Lee family still attends, he described to me how she suddenly brought the subject up one night over dinner in New York. \"She asked me, 'You ever wonder why I didn't write anything else?' And I said, 'Along with several million other people, yes, I had wondered about that.' And she said, 'Well, what do you think?'\" Speaking in his slow southern drawl, the Rev Butts, who just turned 80, suggested to her that she had already written a great book and therefore didn't need to compete with herself. \"And when I got through she said, 'You're all wrong.' I said, 'Alright, smart Alec. You tell me.' She said, 'I would not go through all the deprivation of privacy through which I went for this book again for any amount of money.' \"And she said, 'I did not need to write another book. I said what I wanted to say in that book.'\" Harper Lee called it a simple tale about the \"conflict of the human soul\" and Monroeville, Alabama, is where she drew her inspiration. The story depicts the segregated South of her childhood, during the Depression. It was published at the height of the civil rights struggle. The Rev Butts grew up 10 miles outside Monroeville. By the late 1950s, he says, he was a \"fuzzy-cheeked young preacher\" campaigning for an end to segregation. He had met Martin Luther King Jr and signed a petition to boycott buses. The Ku Klux Klan had left a burning cross on his front lawn. He says To Kill a Mockingbird was not well received in Monroeville when it was published. \"The people who were hard racist did not like it because of the implication of the book,\" the Rev Butts told me. \"The book revealed racism and that always frightens a racist - when you pull the cover off them. \"Those of us who stood up for civil rights were much encouraged by the book because in a very skilful and subtle way it addressed itself for justice.\" But these days, the Rev Butts says, there is enormous civic pride in Monroeville. The old courthouse, which Hollywood re-created for the film, now houses a museum to Harper Lee and the town's other literary icon, Truman Capote. Capote was a childhood friend of hers and is thought to be the inspiration for the Dill character in To Kill a Mockingbird. The town's residents often try to protect Lee, allowing her to live a normal life instead of being hounded by fans or bothered with prying questions. \"Being famous",

But her close friend Thomas Lane Butts, a retired minister in her hometown, Monroeville, Alabama, says she once told him the reason. Sitting on a pew in the Methodist church which the Lee family still attends, he described to me how she suddenly brought the subject up one night over dinner in New York. \"She asked me, 'You ever wonder why I didn't write anything else?' And I said, 'Along with several million other people, yes, I had wondered about that.' And she said, 'Well, what do you think?'\" Speaking in his slow southern drawl, the Rev Butts, who just turned 80, suggested to her that she had already written a great book and therefore didn't need to compete with herself. \"And when I got through she said, 'You're all wrong.' I said, 'Alright, smart Alec. You tell me.' She said, 'I would not go through all the deprivation of privacy through which I went for this book again for any amount of money.' \"And she said, 'I did not need to write another book. I said what I wanted to say in that book.'\" Harper Lee called it a simple tale about the \"conflict of the human soul\" and Monroeville, Alabama, is where she drew her inspiration. The story depicts the segregated South of her childhood, during the Depression. It was published at the height of the civil rights struggle. The Rev Butts grew up 10 miles outside Monroeville. By the late 1950s, he says, he was a \"fuzzy-cheeked young preacher\" campaigning for an end to segregation. He had met Martin Luther King Jr and signed a petition to boycott buses. The Ku Klux Klan had left a burning cross on his front lawn. He says To Kill a Mockingbird was not well received in Monroeville when it was published. \"The people who were hard racist did not like it because of the implication of the book,\" the Rev Butts told me. \"The book revealed racism and that always frightens a racist - when you pull the cover off them. \"Those of us who stood up for civil rights were much encouraged by the book because in a very skilful and subtle way it addressed itself for justice.\" But these days, the Rev Butts says, there is enormous civic pride in Monroeville. The old courthouse, which Hollywood re-created for the film, now houses a museum to Harper Lee and the town's other literary icon, Truman Capote.

The ruling preserves the law known as Obamacare, which Mr Obama considers a major part of his presidential legacy. Republicans have vowed to continue fighting the law. \"We've got more work to do, but what we're not going to do is unravel what has now been woven into the fabric of America,\" Mr Obama said. The case, known as King v Burwell, was the second major challenge the law has faced in the US's highest court. Unlike in many other western countries, the US does not have a single-payer healthcare system. Private companies, rather than the US government, provide health insurance for US citizens. The enactment of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) - one of Mr Obama's most significant and controversial domestic achievements - in 2010 mandated that every American had to purchase private insurance. It provided the subsidies to allow many to do so. In 2012, the mandate portion of the law was challenged in the court. The justices ruled to preserve it. In that decision, as in the decision on Thursday, Chief Justice John Roberts surprised observers by siding with his liberal colleagues in support of the law. \"Congress passed the Affordable Care act to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them,\" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the opinion. Justice Anthony Kennedy dissented in 2012, but sided with the majority on Thursday. Had the court made the opposite decision, an estimated 8.7 million people in the US would have been at risk of losing the aid that makes healthcare affordable. The stakes could not have been higher. People's health (crucially important) and Obama's legacy (less important, but for him and those around him fairly vital) were at stake.

Obama defies lame-duck expectations Demonstrators gathered outside the court as early on Thursday morning. Reading updates on their mobile phones, the crowd became jubilant when they learned mid-morning that the court had ruled in their favour. Some began dancing, while others chanted \"If you're covered and you know it clap your hands.\" \"This is a big sigh of relief for millions across the country,\" said Ron Pollack of Families USA, a health-care advocacy organisation. \"The ACA is not just the law of the land, it will remain the law of the land\". \"Today is a good day for healthcare in America,\" said activist Benton Strong. \"I hope this is the end of the line.\" Demonstrators opposing the subsidies did not have a large visible presence. Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in his dissent that the Supreme Court is setting a precedent of favouring some laws over others. \"We should start calling this law Scotuscare\" Justice Scalia wrote, referring to the court's acronym. \"Today's interpretation is not merely unnatural; it is unheard",

The case, known as King v Burwell, was the second major challenge the law has faced in the US's highest court. Unlike in many other western countries, the US does not have a single-payer healthcare system. Private companies, rather than the US government, provide health insurance for US citizens. The enactment of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) - one of Mr Obama's most significant and controversial domestic achievements - in 2010 mandated that every American had to purchase private insurance. It provided the subsidies to allow many to do so. In 2012, the mandate portion of the law was challenged in the court. The justices ruled to preserve it. In that decision, as in the decision on Thursday, Chief Justice John Roberts surprised observers by siding with his liberal colleagues in support of the law. \"Congress passed the Affordable Care act to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them,\" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the opinion. Justice Anthony Kennedy dissented in 2012, but sided with the majority on Thursday. Had the court made the opposite decision, an estimated 8.7 million people in the US would have been at risk of losing the aid that makes healthcare affordable. The stakes could not have been higher. People's health (crucially important) and Obama's legacy (less important, but for him and those around him fairly vital) were at stake.

Ofsted's report said governors, managers and teachers had developed a \"culture of low expectations\", while leaders had failed to act decisively to halt the decline in pupils' achievement.

Ms Purvis told the BBC that had had no influence on her decision to step down. \"I think the clinic's well established here now, we're providing services more and more every year and I'm delighted to be remaining on the advisory board for the clinic. \"But I feel it's time to move on and I think it's time for Marie Stopes to get someone else in to manage the clinic and take it to new places,\" she said. \"At times it was difficult, particularly last year with the court case and the harassment, but I put that behind me and have concentrated on delivering services for women in Ireland both north and south. \"I think I've achieved a significant historical change in the perception of abortion in Northern Ireland from where the usual narrative was that abortion was illegal in Northern Ireland to now one where people understand that abortion is legal under certain circumstances. \"I think we've challenged the myths and stereotypes that are presented by those who are opposed to a woman's right to chose.\" Genevieve Edwards, director of policy for Marie Stopes UK, said: \"We were so lucky to have Dawn and wish her every success in whatever she chooses to do. \"The support for the clinic since it opened in very challenging circumstances has been heartening and a source of great comfort and pride for our staff and volunteers. \"We are now actively recruiting for Dawn's successor to lead us into the next phase of the clinic's journey.\"",

Morocco controls two-thirds of Western Sahara and sees it as part of its historic territory. However some, including the UN, see Western Sahara as Africa's last colony. Africa Live: More on this and other stories Find out more about Western Sahara A referendum was promised in 1991 but never carried out due to wrangling over who was eligible to vote. Thousands of Sahrawi refugees still live in refugee camps in Algeria - some have been there for 40 years. It is not clear what happens next but Western Sahara is hopeful that a committee set up by the AU will address the issues that both sides have raised. Some AU delegates said that it would be easier to resolve the issue with Morocco inside the AU. Sidi Mohammed, a Western Sahara official, told the BBC that Morocco's return to the AU means that it would now be expected to put \"in practice decisions taken by the AU with regard to a referendum in Western Sahara\". Mr Mohammed dismissed the suggestion that Morocco would now seek to get the AU to change its position, saying that the no country could unilaterally change the AU fundamental agreement, saying it opposed colonisation. In his speech at the AU summit, King Mohammed VI of Morocco said the readmission was not meant to divide the continental body. No. Algeria has always been a big supporter of Western Sahara's Polisario Front and it had wanted Morocco to accept independence of the territory as a condition for readmission. Zimbabwe and South Africa were also supportive of this stance but they were outnumbered by those who wanted Morocco back in the fold. There is no specific provision in the AU charter that bars any country from joining it. Morocco simply applied and the request was accepted by more than two-thirds of the 53 members. Morocco has been involved in intense lobbying and applied in July last year to rejoin the continental body. King Mohammed toured various African countries seeking support for the bid. No. While culturally the country's identity aligns with Arab states, its economic interests increasingly lie in Africa. This is a strategic move to continue exploring its interests in mining, construction, medical, insurance and banking sectors on the continent.

        "article": "Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake said she was replacing Police Commissioner Anthony Batts with his deputy, Kevin Davis, for an interim period. The city was rocked by riots in April when a black man died after suffering injuries in police custody. Six officers were charged over the death of the 25-year-old, Freddie Gray. Speaking at a news conference on Wednesday, Mayor Rawlings-Blake said Mr Batts had \"served this city with distinction\" since becoming police chief in October 2012. But referring to the city's high homicide rate, she said \"too many continue to die\". \"The focus has been too much on the leadership of the department and not enough on the crime fighting,\" she told reporters, adding: \"We need to get the crime surge under control.\" The city has seen a sharp increase in violence since Freddie Gray's death on 19 April, with 155 homicides this year, a 48% increase over the same period last year. On Tuesday, the police department announced that an outside organisation will review its response to the civil unrest that followed Mr Gray's death. The US justice department is also conducting a civil rights review of the Baltimore force and Mr Batts has been criticised by the city's police union. Earlier on Wednesday, the union released its report into the police handling of the rioting. It said officers had complained \"that they lacked basic riot equipment, training, and, as events unfolded, direction from leadership\". The report also said \"officers repeatedly expressed concern that the passive response to the civil unrest had allowed the disorder to grow into full scale rioting\". Recent events had \"placed attention on police leadership\", Ms Rawlings-Blake said, but denied her decision was influenced by the union report. Mr Davis, who is taking over immediately as interim police chief, praised his \"friend\" Mr Batts and said he was a \"true reform commissioner\". Mayor Rawlings-Blake said Mr Davis would \"bring accountability to police, hold officers who act out of line accountable for their actions\".",

Speaking at a news conference on Wednesday, Mayor Rawlings-Blake said Mr Batts had \"served this city with distinction\" since becoming police chief in October 2012. But referring to the city's high homicide rate, she said \"too many continue to die\". \"The focus has been too much on the leadership of the department and not enough on the crime fighting,\" she told reporters, adding: \"We need to get the crime surge under control.\" The city has seen a sharp increase in violence since Freddie Gray's death on 19 April, with 155 homicides this year, a 48% increase over the same period last year. On Tuesday, the police department announced that an outside organisation will review its response to the civil unrest that followed Mr Gray's death. The US justice department is also conducting a civil rights review of the Baltimore force and Mr Batts has been criticised by the city's police union. Earlier on Wednesday, the union released its report into the police handling of the rioting. It said officers had complained \"that they lacked basic riot equipment, training, and, as events unfolded, direction from leadership\". The report also said \"officers repeatedly expressed concern that the passive response to the civil unrest had allowed the disorder to grow into full scale rioting\".

It was, again, an immense swim.\" Karen Pickering, British 2001 world 4x200m freestyle gold medallist We all know how strong Peaty is. In his semi-final he was a little bit lower in the water as he set his world record. Because he's not quite as high as he is in the 100m, he has a quicker turnover. He can keep that up for 50m, but not for a 100m - that's why he went to 25.95 seconds. You couldn't do that in the 100m because of the build-up of lactic acid. But because it's Adam Peaty, he might be able to manage that in a year.

His intervention in the debate - made, as he termed it, with \"deafening eclat\" - was even said to have helped cause the pound to slide on the international money markets as traders thought it made the possibility of a so-called Brexit more likely. He has arguably the highest profile of any of the governing Conservative Party except the Prime Minister David Cameron, but those outside the UK may be wondering: who is he, and is that actually his hair? Read on. Profile: Boris Johnson How could 'zip wire prat' become prime minister? Read more about the UK's referendum on the EU Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson, to give him his full name, was born in New York and is descended from Turkish, French and German stock. He describes himself as a \"one-man melting pot\".

Councillor Bryan Lodge, cabinet member for Environment and Street Scene, said there had been months of \"unlawful and costly disruption\" to tree replacement works in Sheffield by a small number of protesters. \"We continue to support the right to peacefully protest, and the majority of protesters who are doing so peacefully will not be affected,\" he added. \"But there is a big difference between this and direct action which deliberately and unlawfully stops works from being carried out.\" Mr Lodge said protesters had been sent a letter several weeks ago confirming their actions were unlawful. \"Streets Ahead is not just about street trees, it's about ensuring we have roads, pavements and a street scene to be proud of for many years to come,\" he added. \"In addition, it presents us with a unique opportunity to sustainably manage, increase and maintain our diverse street tree stock over a 25 year period.\" The council said, despite the letter, works were still being disrupted \"causing city-wide delays\".",
        "summary": "Sheffield City Council's decision to seek an injunction to stop councillors from taking part in future protests is a decision taken in order to ensure lawful and necessary protests against the felling of street trees are not had by other councillors.",

Needing 99 to win, England sent out Jos Buttler and Ben Stokes in the top four. But they were eventually beaten by the fading light, finishing 25 runs short of a famous victory on 74-4. The tourists could not find the boundary frequently enough before the umpires brought the teams off, with Joe Root 33 not out. However, this was a hugely impressive performance from England and one that will fill them with confidence ahead of the second Test in Dubai, which begins on Thursday. After England concluded their innings on 598-9 in the morning, Pakistan looked assured at 113-3 shortly after tea, leading by 38 with seven second-innings wickets remaining. But the match turned when veteran batsman Younus Khan, playing in his 102nd Test match, mistimed a wild heave to give Rashid his first Test wicket - caught at point by Stokes. Rashid - whose figures in the first innings were the worst ever by a debutant - then quickly added a second victim, having Asad Shafiq caught behind for six. The door was opened for England, and Rashid and Moeen Ali barged through it as they polished off the last five wickets for 14 runs. Pakistan skipper Misbah ul-Haq - who had played with restraint for his 51 - inexplicably aimed an uncharacteristic slog at Moeen and was bowled. Moeen then removed Wahab Riaz caught behind, before Rashid claimed the final three wickets - all superbly caught at first slip by James Anderson. England sensed an unlikely victory, but their reorganised batting order could not score quickly enough as Pakistan's tactic of spin from both ends and fielders on the boundary brought them regular wickets. Makeshift opener Buttler was trapped lbw for four, Moeen and Stokes were caught on the boundary in quick succession, and Jonny Bairstow was stumped attempting a big shot. However, in truth it was mistakes earlier in the match that ultimately proved more costly as England fell just short of their first win on the subcontinent since beating India in Kolkata in 2012. In Pakistan's first innings, Ian Bell dropped Mohammad Hafeez (98) and Shafiq (107) at slip early in their innings. And Shoaib Malik, who made 245, was dismissed off a no-ball by Stuart Broad. England captain Alastair Cook, whose record-breaking 263 in the first innings was ultimately in vain, admitted England were frustrated to come so close to victory. \"We'd have liked another three or four overs at the end but that's the way it goes,\" he said. \"I can't fault the guys for hanging in there on that wicket. \"The pitch did deteriorate and spun more today which gave us hope, so it's a bit of a bittersweet finish.

Needing 99 to win, England sent out Jos Buttler and Ben Stokes in the top four. But they were eventually beaten by the fading light, finishing 25 runs short of a famous victory on 74-4. The tourists could not find the boundary frequently enough before the umpires brought the teams off, with Joe Root 33 not out. However, this was a hugely impressive performance from England and one that will fill them with confidence ahead of the second Test in Dubai, which begins on Thursday. After England concluded their innings on 598-9 in the morning, Pakistan looked assured at 113-3 shortly after tea, leading by 38 with seven second-innings wickets remaining. But the match turned when veteran batsman Younus Khan, playing in his 102nd Test match, mistimed a wild heave to give Rashid his first Test wicket - caught at point by Stokes. Rashid - whose figures in the first innings were the worst ever by a debutant - then quickly added a second victim, having Asad Shafiq caught behind for six. The door was opened for England, and Rashid and Moeen Ali barged through it as they polished off the last five wickets for 14 runs. Pakistan skipper Misbah ul-Haq - who had played with restraint for his 51 - inexplicably aimed an uncharacteristic slog at Moeen and was bowled. Moeen then removed Wahab Riaz caught behind, before Rashid claimed the final three wickets - all superbly caught at first slip by James Anderson. England sensed an unlikely victory, but their reorganised batting order could not score quickly enough as Pakistan's tactic of spin from both ends and fielders on the boundary brought them regular wickets. Makeshift opener Buttler was trapped lbw for four, Moeen and Stokes were caught on the boundary in quick succession, and Jonny Bairstow was stumped attempting a big shot. However, in truth it was mistakes earlier in the match that ultimately proved more costly as England fell just short of their first win on the subcontinent since beating India in Kolkata in 2012. In Pakistan's first innings, Ian Bell dropped Mohammad Hafeez (98) and Shafiq (107) at slip early in their innings. And Shoaib Malik, who made 245, was dismissed off a no-ball by Stuart Broad. England captain Alastair Cook, whose record-breaking 263 in the first innings was ultimately in vain, admitted England were frustrated to come so close to victory. \"We'd have liked another three or four overs at the end but that's the way it goes,\" he said. \"I can't fault the guys for hanging in there on that wicket. \"The pitch did deteriorate and spun more today which gave us hope, so it's a bit of a bittersweet finish.

After England concluded their innings on 598-9 in the morning, Pakistan looked assured at 113-3 shortly after tea, leading by 38 with seven second-innings wickets remaining. But the match turned when veteran batsman Younus Khan, playing in his 102nd Test match, mistimed a wild heave to give Rashid his first Test wicket - caught at point by Stokes. Rashid - whose figures in the first innings were the worst ever by a debutant - then quickly added a second victim, having Asad Shafiq caught behind for six. The door was opened for England, and Rashid and Moeen Ali barged through it as they polished off the last five wickets for 14 runs. Pakistan skipper Misbah ul-Haq - who had played with restraint for his 51 - inexplicably aimed an uncharacteristic slog at Moeen and was bowled. Moeen then removed Wahab Riaz caught behind, before Rashid claimed the final three wickets - all superbly caught at first slip by James Anderson. England sensed an unlikely victory, but their reorganised batting order could not score quickly enough as Pakistan's tactic of spin from both ends and fielders on the boundary brought them regular wickets. Makeshift opener Buttler was trapped lbw for four, Moeen and Stokes were caught on the boundary in quick succession, and Jonny Bairstow was stumped attempting a big shot. However, in truth it was mistakes earlier in the match that ultimately proved more costly as England fell just short of their first win on the subcontinent since beating India in Kolkata in 2012. In Pakistan's first innings, Ian Bell dropped Mohammad Hafeez (98) and Shafiq (107) at slip early in their innings. And Shoaib Malik, who made 245, was dismissed off a no-ball by Stuart Broad. England captain Alastair Cook, whose record-breaking 263 in the first innings was ultimately in vain, admitted England were frustrated to come so close to victory. \"We'd have liked another three or four overs at the end but that's the way it goes,\" he said. \"I can't fault the guys for hanging in there on that wicket. \"The pitch did deteriorate and spun more today which gave us hope, so it's a bit of a bittersweet finish.

The group has warned that 750 more foster carers are \"urgently\" needed to meet the demands of the care system. It urged people to \"open their hearts and homes\" to vulnerable youngsters. Currently, more than 5,500 children are in foster care in Scotland, living with 4,400 families and carers. The Fostering Network surveyed 250 children, teenagers and foster carers across Scotland and discovered that many young people had failed to find stability.

A Scottish government spokeswoman said: \"Giving young people security is paramount and we have done a great deal of work with our partners across local government and the third sector to improve how we intervene early when there is a problem within families to find appropriate solutions quickly. \"We have also expanded the age at which young people can remain in foster care as part of the continuing care provisions and the support available when they transition into independent living.\"",

There was a particular need for homes to be found for vulnerable teenagers, siblings and disabled children, the study found. Carla, 23, was taken into care at the age of 12 and had eight foster homes before moving in with the Randalls. \"Looking back now I realised that the Randalls saved my life,\" she said. \"I never understood the extent of the neglect and abuse I had endured until I came to live with a 'normal' loving family. \"They were just always themselves, the smallest details meant so much to me. \"They nurtured a young, angry, untrusting teenager to become a positive, empathetic and successful young woman.\" The Fostering Network said instability had a detrimental effect on the child's education and wellbeing, while finding a stable foster carer from the outset could lead to improved relationships and a happier childhood. Sara Lurie, director of the Fostering Network Scotland, said: \"As each year passes, we see more and more children coming into care. \"We need people who can open their heart, and their homes, to vulnerable children and young people and use their skills to help support them to reach their full potential. \"In particular we need people who have the skills, patience and passion to look after teenagers who may have had a really tough time and be facing some real challenges, and to offer them love, stability and security. \"A good foster carer will believe in the ambition of the children in their care in the same way they'd believe in the ambition of their biological family members.\" Apologies for the delay, see below as requested. A Scottish government spokeswoman said: \"Giving young people security is paramount and we have done a great deal of work with our partners across local government and the third sector to improve how we intervene early when there is a problem within families to find appropriate solutions quickly. \"We have also expanded the age at which young people can remain in foster care as part of the continuing care provisions and the support available when they transition into independent living.\"",

Uhuru Kenyatta, who faces trial at the International Criminal Court, has been leading in early presidential results declared from Monday's tightly contested election. He is due to stand trial at The Hague next month for allegedly fuelling violence after the disputed 2007 election. He denies the charge. His closest rival is outgoing Prime Minister Raila Odinga. With provisional results in from more than 40% of polling stations earlier on Wednesday, Mr Odinga had 42% of the vote compared with Mr Kenyatta's 53%. However, Mr Odinga's allies remain confident that he will gain ground as results from his strongholds, including the Coast Province, are declared. More than 1,000 people were killed in the violence which broke out in 2007-08 after Mr Odinga claimed he had been cheated of victory by supporters of President Mwai Kibaki, who is stepping down after two terms in office. The BBC's Solomon Mugera in the capital, Nairobi, says Kenyans are becoming increasingly anxious about the delay in finalising the results. Some businesses and schools across the country have remained shut since Monday's election, he says. This has led to a shortage of goods, pushing up the prices of basic foodstuff in areas such as Kibera, the biggest slum in Nairobi and a stronghold of Mr Odinga, our correspondent adds.

Our correspondent says the large number of spoiled ballots - about 6% of the total vote, well over double the number of votes cast for the third-placed candidate, Musailia Mudavadi - has become a major bone of contention. Mr Odinga's Coalition of Reforms and Democracy (Cord) wants them to be counted, but Mr Kenyatta's Jubilee Coalition is resisting this.

Our correspondent says the large number of spoiled ballots - about 6% of the total vote, well over double the number of votes cast for the third-placed candidate, Musailia Mudavadi - has become a major bone of contention. Mr Odinga's Coalition of Reforms and Democracy (Cord) wants them to be counted, but Mr Kenyatta's Jubilee Coalition is resisting this. Late on Tuesday, the election commission announced that the spoiled ballots would count in the overall vote total, increasing the likelihood of a run-off between the top two candidates, news agencies report. Mr Kenyatta's running mate William Ruto, who is also facing a trial at the ICC, said foreign embassies may have influenced such a decision. \"We want to believe that this is not an attempt to deny the Jubilee Coalition a first-round victory as is clearly now on the wall,\" he is quoted by Reuters news agency as saying.

        "article": "Returning officers were ordered to physically deliver paper copies of their constituency's tallies to the counting centre in the capital. Election officials have urged patience. Uhuru Kenyatta, who faces trial at the International Criminal Court, has been leading in early presidential results declared from Monday's tightly contested election. He is due to stand trial at The Hague next month for allegedly fuelling violence after the disputed 2007 election. He denies the charge. His closest rival is outgoing Prime Minister Raila Odinga. With provisional results in from more than 40% of polling stations earlier on Wednesday, Mr Odinga had 42% of the vote compared with Mr Kenyatta's 53%. However, Mr Odinga's allies remain confident that he will gain ground as results from his strongholds, including the Coast Province, are declared. More than 1,000 people were killed in the violence which broke out in 2007-08 after Mr Odinga claimed he had been cheated of victory by supporters of President Mwai Kibaki, who is stepping down after two terms in office. The BBC's Solomon Mugera in the capital, Nairobi, says Kenyans are becoming increasingly anxious about the delay in finalising the results. Some businesses and schools across the country have remained shut since Monday's election, he says. This has led to a shortage of goods, pushing up the prices of basic foodstuff in areas such as Kibera, the biggest slum in Nairobi and a stronghold of Mr Odinga, our correspondent adds.

Marussia said surgeons at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge \"embarked on a lengthy procedure to address the serious head and facial injuries sustained by Maria in the accident\". It said: \"The operation began yesterday afternoon and she was in theatre until this morning. \"Maria remains in a critical but stable condition.\" John Booth, team principal of the Marussia F1 Team, said: \"Maria emerged from theatre at Addenbrooke's Hospital this morning after a lengthy operation to address the serious head and facial injuries she received in the accident at Duxford Airfield yesterday. \"We are grateful for the medical attention that Maria has been receiving and her family would like to thank the Neurological and Plastics surgical teams. \"However, it is with great sadness that I must report that, due to the injuries she sustained, Maria has lost her right eye. \"Maria's care and the wellbeing of her family remain our priority at this time.

It said: \"The operation began yesterday afternoon and she was in theatre until this morning. \"Maria remains in a critical but stable condition.\" John Booth, team principal of the Marussia F1 Team, said: \"Maria emerged from theatre at Addenbrooke's Hospital this morning after a lengthy operation to address the serious head and facial injuries she received in the accident at Duxford Airfield yesterday. \"We are grateful for the medical attention that Maria has been receiving and her family would like to thank the Neurological and Plastics surgical teams. \"However, it is with great sadness that I must report that, due to the injuries she sustained, Maria has lost her right eye. \"Maria's care and the wellbeing of her family remain our priority at this time. Her family are at the hospital and we are doing everything possible to support them.\" De Villota sustained her injuries after her car \"suddenly accelerated\" into the back of the support lorry, according to witnesses. BBC Radio Cambridgeshire presenter Chris Mann, who saw the accident, said: \"The top of her car and her helmet seemed to take the brunt of it. \"She didn't move for about 15 minutes.\" He said De Villota had been driving at up to 200mph during the testing, but the car was travelling considerably slower at the time of the crash. Mr Booth said: \"With regard to the accident, we have embarked on a very comprehensive analysis of what happened and this work continues for the moment.\" Messages of support have come in from the motor racing world, including ones from Ferrari driver and fellow Spaniard Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button. Formula 1 driver and BBC analyst Jaime Alguersari said in his weekly column : \"I was shocked to hear of the accident suffered by Maria de Villota. I know her and her family very well. I still don't know the cause of the accident. There are so many rumours but I want to wait to see what really happened. \"It's terribly sad. Maria is a fantastic person, as are her brothers and her father Emilio, who was one of Spain's first F1 drivers. \"She is a role model, especially for all the females who want to get into F1. So this is a very sad situation. \"Thankfully, she is not in a life-threatening situation so we have to look at the positive side.

        "article": "Steven Maclean bundled home the opener five minutes before half-time. The hosts, slacker after the break, had beleaguered striker Larnell Cole sent-off after he confronted the referee. Liam Craig sealed the win from the penalty spot with two minutes to play, before Graham Cummins finished a sumptuous stoppage-time move. And things got worse still for Caley Thistle after the match, with captain Gary Warren shown a red card in the tunnel. Saints remain five points clear of Hearts in fourth place, and closed the gap on third-placed Rangers, who play Aberdeen on Sunday, to three points. With game after game ticking past, Inverness' position looks increasingly perilous. Next weekend's trip to Motherwell, second-bottom on goal difference, is now seismic. This contest turned nightmarish for the hosts after a bright opening, but the truth is, given their predicament, Caley Thistle did not threaten St Johnstone's goal enough. Billy Mckay sent a shot over from close range. Alex Fisher nodded a diving header wide. Carl Tremarco miscued a volley. Greg Tansey did draw a save from Alan Mannus when he rasped in an effort from outside the box, but Richie Foran's side never looked likely to find the net. Their best opportunity came immediately after the Saints went ahead, when Tansey fed Cole, who seemed to panic in a terrific position and shot straight at Mannus. Cole's dismissal ended the contest when he appeared to be cautioned twice for challenging referee Stephen Finnie's decision not to award a foul. St Johnstone were merciless and could have had more. With just one win from their last 21 league games, Inverness look deep in trouble. Tommy Wright's side deserve so much credit. Saints were tactically brilliant, so strong defensively and ruthlessly capitalised on their man advantage. They took one of their few first-half chances when Michael Coulson broke down the left and sent a dangerous ball across the six-yard box. Owain Fon Williams could only parry into the danger area, Cummins' shot was blocked but Maclean followed up to force it home. They should have had another when Craig's superb curling corner flew all the way to the back post where Cummins slid in and somehow knocked it over from two yards. Craig, in his 300th appearance for the club, coolly converted a spot-kick after Cummins was tripped to seal the points. Cummins then slammed home after Miller danced around the area to tee him up, before Craig cracked the bar amid the late flurry. With a tendency to finish the season strongly, and just a three-point gap to Rangers, the Perth side look capable of something special this term. Inverness CT manager Richie Foran: \"It is a tough time of the season to be sitting bottom, and I need real men to stand up to that, but not enough of them did that today. \"It is pure luck we are still in it and it is only four points. I sound like a broken record but one win changes it - that is the truth. But I need braver players with more passion and desire.",

Cummins then slammed home after Miller danced around the area to tee him up, before Craig cracked the bar amid the late flurry.

        "article": "Steven Maclean bundled home the opener five minutes before half-time. The hosts, slacker after the break, had beleaguered striker Larnell Cole sent-off after he confronted the referee. Liam Craig sealed the win from the penalty spot with two minutes to play, before Graham Cummins finished a sumptuous stoppage-time move. And things got worse still for Caley Thistle after the match, with captain Gary Warren shown a red card in the tunnel. Saints remain five points clear of Hearts in fourth place, and closed the gap on third-placed Rangers, who play Aberdeen on Sunday, to three points. With game after game ticking past, Inverness' position looks increasingly perilous. Next weekend's trip to Motherwell, second-bottom on goal difference, is now seismic. This contest turned nightmarish for the hosts after a bright opening, but the truth is, given their predicament, Caley Thistle did not threaten St Johnstone's goal enough. Billy Mckay sent a shot over from close range. Alex Fisher nodded a diving header wide. Carl Tremarco miscued a volley. Greg Tansey did draw a save from Alan Mannus when he rasped in an effort from outside the box, but Richie Foran's side never looked likely to find the net. Their best opportunity came immediately after the Saints went ahead, when Tansey fed Cole, who seemed to panic in a terrific position and shot straight at Mannus. Cole's dismissal ended the contest when he appeared to be cautioned twice for challenging referee Stephen Finnie's decision not to award a foul. St Johnstone were merciless and could have had more. With just one win from their last 21 league games, Inverness look deep in trouble. Tommy Wright's side deserve so much credit. Saints were tactically brilliant, so strong defensively and ruthlessly capitalised on their man advantage. They took one of their few first-half chances when Michael Coulson broke down the left and sent a dangerous ball across the six-yard box. Owain Fon Williams could only parry into the danger area, Cummins' shot was blocked but Maclean followed up to force it home. They should have had another when Craig's superb curling corner flew all the way to the back post where Cummins slid in and somehow knocked it over from two yards. Craig, in his 300th appearance for the club, coolly converted a spot-kick after Cummins was tripped to seal the points. Cummins then slammed home after Miller danced around the area to tee him up, before Craig cracked the bar amid the late flurry. With a tendency to finish the season strongly, and just a three-point gap to Rangers, the Perth side look capable of something special this term. Inverness CT manager Richie Foran: \"It is a tough time of the season to be sitting bottom, and I need real men to stand up to that, but not enough of them did that today. \"It is pure luck we are still in it and it is only four points. I sound like a broken record but one win changes it - that is the truth. But I need braver players with more passion and desire.",

After his arrest, the court heard, he refused to give a breath sample and demanded to speak to his solicitor. Lisa Judge, defending, said he allowed the matter to \"escalate out of all control\" and \"unfortunately\" believed he had the right to see a lawyer, instead of being breathalysed. Carlisle has revealed he attempted to take his own life two days afterwards, when he was hit by a lorry on the A64 near York. Miss Judge described the arrest as having happened while he was \"in an extremely dark place in terms of his own life\". Carlisle is now so sorry about what happened that the court-ordered medical report on him \"utterly oozes remorse\", Miss Judge said.

At the party's weekly press briefing, I asked the Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies, who was elected on the list, whether he'd stand as a constituency candidate in his home turf of the Vale of Glamorgan but he said he hadn't thought about it. Presumably those are the kind of decisions they will now feel more confident contemplating. The party will also have a huge amount of new data on voters which it'll be able to call upon and the belief that campaigning hard on the NHS helped the Tories cross the line in places like the Vale of Clwyd and Gower. The Conservatives feel it's them, rather than any of the other opposition parties, who have become the repository of votes from those who are disaffected by the state of the NHS. Welsh Labour are going to hold a \"short sharp\" analysis into what went wrong. Carwyn Jones was in line with most of the criticism of Ed Miliband when he told AMs that the party needed to appeal to small business owners who are not millionaires but who work hard. What will be more difficult is countering the argument on the NHS, which the former minister Alun Davies believes is already lost. Another potential difficulty for Welsh Labour will be dealing with unhappiness within the party over council re-organisation. Bernie Attridge, the deputy leader of Flintshire Council, has tweeted saying the party needs to be careful on local government reform if it wants to retain the support of grassroots councillors. It also seems to have been the case that Labour lost more votes to UKIP than the Conservatives, which is another challenge to overcome. But Labour will at least have the advantage that it will be David Cameron, and not Ed Miliband, carrying out the latest round of public sector cuts that are likely to take effect sooner rather than later. The question is whether Carwyn Jones is going to be able to turn that to his advantage when his own record in government will be under scrutiny. Plaid Cymru's education spokesman, Simon Thomas, also in the party's weekly press briefing, said he believed Leanne Wood could portray herself as an alternative first minister because of the way she emotionally connected with people in the campaign. The party now has a year to make that a credible proposition after it failed to gain any new seats and came fourth, behind UKIP, in the overall share of the vote, despite her unprecedented profile.

        "article": "The Conservatives have been given a huge confidence boost and will feel in a position to challenge in more constituencies next year, rather than just on the list. At the party's weekly press briefing, I asked the Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies, who was elected on the list, whether he'd stand as a constituency candidate in his home turf of the Vale of Glamorgan but he said he hadn't thought about it. Presumably those are the kind of decisions they will now feel more confident contemplating. The party will also have a huge amount of new data on voters which it'll be able to call upon and the belief that campaigning hard on the NHS helped the Tories cross the line in places like the Vale of Clwyd and Gower. The Conservatives feel it's them, rather than any of the other opposition parties, who have become the repository of votes from those who are disaffected by the state of the NHS. Welsh Labour are going to hold a \"short sharp\" analysis into what went wrong. Carwyn Jones was in line with most of the criticism of Ed Miliband when he told AMs that the party needed to appeal to small business owners who are not millionaires but who work hard. What will be more difficult is countering the argument on the NHS, which the former minister Alun Davies believes is already lost. Another potential difficulty for Welsh Labour will be dealing with unhappiness within the party over council re-organisation. Bernie Attridge, the deputy leader of Flintshire Council, has tweeted saying the party needs to be careful on local government reform if it wants to retain the support of grassroots councillors. It also seems to have been the case that Labour lost more votes to UKIP than the Conservatives, which is another challenge to overcome. But Labour will at least have the advantage that it will be David Cameron, and not Ed Miliband, carrying out the latest round of public sector cuts that are likely to take effect sooner rather than later. The question is whether Carwyn Jones is going to be able to turn that to his advantage when his own record in government will be under scrutiny. Plaid Cymru's education spokesman, Simon Thomas, also in the party's weekly press briefing, said he believed Leanne Wood could portray herself as an alternative first minister because of the way she emotionally connected with people in the campaign. The party now has a year to make that a credible proposition after it failed to gain any new seats and came fourth, behind UKIP, in the overall share of the vote, despite her unprecedented profile. He also said that on the campaign trail people wanted to know what Plaid was going to do about the NHS and that people \"did not see the strengths\" of its arguments.

Their intention in travelling to the region, where areas are controlled by Islamic State (IS) militants or an al-Qaeda affiliate, is not clear. The Foreign Office has said it is in contact with the Turkish authorities. The BBC's Mark Lowen said the information about the ages of the children had not been independently verified and it was too early to know where the group were intending to head to. \"Were they heading for one of the more moderate groups in Syria. Were they heading for the area controlled by al-Nusra, the al-Qaeda affiliate? Or were they heading to so-called Islamic State territory?\" he said. The group was taken to a police station in southern Turkey overnight, and then sent to the foreigners department awaiting deportation to the UK. They have undergone medical examinations and had their finger-prints taken. The United Nations estimates the number of foreign fighters joining militant groups is more than 25,000, from 100 different nations. About 600 Britons are believed to have gone to Syria or Iraq since IS seized control of large swathes of territory there. Most are thought to have volunteered as fighters for the militant Islamist group. Around half are believed to have later returned to the UK, the Metropolitan Police has said. The latest detentions come two weeks after three British teenagers were stopped from travelling into Syria from Turkey. The three - two aged 17 and one 19, from north-west London - were arrested following a tip-off from British police and flown back to the UK. They have since been released on police bail. They had flown to Turkey from Barcelona and were arrested at Sabiha Gokcen airport in Istanbul. Fadi Hakura, Turkey analyst for Chatham House, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the recent arrests showed the Turkish government was \"taking more effective measures to control the flow of fighters and supporters into Syria\". He said there was now \"more enhanced security and intelligence cooperation between Turkey and its Western counterparts, especially with the exchange of names that Turkey needs to prohibit [IS supporters] from crossing into Syria\". The Turkish government has said it cannot make a 560-mile border watertight and will act when it has prior warning. In February this year there were recriminations between British police and Turkish officials after three London schoolgirls disappeared from Turkey, apparently having crossed the border into Syria. Shamima Begum, Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16 had flown to Istanbul and travelled to the border region.

Fadi Hakura, Turkey analyst for Chatham House, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the recent arrests showed the Turkish government was \"taking more effective measures to control the flow of fighters and supporters into Syria\". He said there was now \"more enhanced security and intelligence cooperation between Turkey and its Western counterparts, especially with the exchange of names that Turkey needs to prohibit [IS supporters] from crossing into Syria\".

One of the concerns mentioned in the petition is the idea of tribunals that foreign investors would be able to use in some circumstances to sue governments. There is a great deal of controversy over exactly what this system, known as Investor State Dispute Settlement, would enable companies to do, but campaigners see it as an opportunity for international business to get compensation for government policy changes that adversely affect them. This kind of provision exists in many bilateral trade and investment agreements. Friends of the Earth have published new research on the impact they have had on EU countries.

Information about these cases is not always made public, but the group says that going back to 1994, foreign investors have sought compensation of almost \u20ac30bn (\u00a324bn) from 20 states. Where the results are known (a small minority of the total), the tribunals have awarded total compensation of \u20ac3.5bn (about \u00a32.8bn). In Britain, the possible implications of this provision for the National Health Service have been especially controversial. Campaigners believe that the investor tribunals would make it harder to reverse any decisions to contract services out to international healthcare firms. John Hilary of War on Want said: TTIP \"will make it impossible for any future government to repeal the Health & Social Care Act and bring the NHS back into public hands\". The petition lists a number of other areas where its signatories believes European standards would suffer if the TTIP negotiations are completed and the Canada deal is ratified: employment, social, environmental, privacy and consumer protection. The European Commission says the EU will not have to sacrifice its high standards. It also says investor protection provisions are important for investment flows and have in general worked well. But it accepts there is a need for improvement and is trying to achieve that in its bilateral negotiations. The petition has been organised as an exercise called a European Citizens' Initiative which can lead to a public hearing in the European Parliament and require the European Commission to give a formal response explaining why it is accepting or rejecting what the petitioners call for. The European Commission has already said that the petition doesn't qualify as such an Initiative. Campaigners have launched a legal challenge to this decision.",

Archaeologist David Jacques, said: \"They... used the stump of the tree, about three metres high, as a wall.\" The finds are being shown to United Nations heritage experts, who are currently visiting Stonehenge. Archaeologists are concerned a planned 2.9km tunnel being considered for the nearby A303 main road will damage the site. Discoveries have also shown stones were warmed up by the Mesolithic Period inhabitants and used in a hearth to emit heat in the earthy snug. Mr Jacques, a senior research fellow at the University of Buckingham, has worked at Blick Mead for over a decade, making a number of discoveries about the inhabitants. The tree stump created a wall height similar to a \"modern bungalow\". \"They've draped probably animal skins or thatch around the basin and connected it to a post so it's a very comfortable snug little place,\" he said.

Following on, he then made 68 in Surrey's 166-3 to keep Hampshire at bay and prompt handshakes at 16:50 BST. The draw sees third-placed Hampshire claim 12 points, while Surrey take 10 points and stay sixth in Division One. Burns' epic effort saw him stay in the field for all but 10 overs of the entire match, as he defied Hampshire's bowling efforts on a flat Oval pitch. The left-hander was dropped twice in the slip cordon in his career-best 219, but was the only one to resist as Ian Holland (3-37) dismissed Tom Curran (53), Amar Virdi and Mark Footitt to force the follow-on after Surrey began the day on 410-7. Mark Stoneman (47) and Burns then put on an opening stand of 109 before Holland's medium pace had Stoneman lbw and Scott Borthwick bowled in a single over. Sean Ervine became the only man to dismiss Burns in 756 minutes of play when he missed a ball down the leg side, but Jason Roy and Dominic Sibley continued on until the conclusion. Surrey captain Rory Burns told BBC Radio London: \"I'm really pleased that we've fought that hard to get the draw and the extra five points, and obviously pretty happy with how I've played. \"We had to bat seven sessions to get us to safety and that's all I was thinking. \"There were some jitters in the nineties and I got a lifeline, which was quite nice.

        "article": "The woman, 37-year-old Wu Shuoyan, is alleged to have been killed last May simply for refusing to hand over her phone number to cult members. The murder, filmed on CCTV and on mobile phones, sparked outrage. The Church of the Almighty God cult is banned in China but claims to have millions of members. Following the brutal killing in May, Chinese authorities said that they detained hundreds of members of the cult, reports the BBC's Martin Patience in Beijing. Interviewed in prison later, one of the defendants, Zhang Lidong showed no remorse. He said: \"I beat her with all my might and stamped on her too. She was a demon. We had to destroy her.\" The group had entered a small McDonalds branch in Zhaoyuan in Shandong province last May soliciting phone numbers and hoping to recruit members to their cult. Ms Wu was waiting in the restaurant with her seven-year-old son and when she refused to give her number, an act which prompted the beating while they screamed at other diners to keep away or they would face the same fate. The public face of the Church of the Almighty God is a website full of uplifting hymns and homilies. But its core belief is that God has returned to earth as a Chinese woman to wreak the apocalypse. The only person who claims direct contact with this god is a former physics teacher, Zhao Weishan, who founded the cult 25 years ago and has since fled to the United States, says BBC China Editor Carrie Gracie. No-one knows exactly where he is, but much of the website's message of outright hostility to the Chinese government is delivered in English as well as Chinese. The cult complains that religious faith has suffered from persecution by the Communist Party.

Several of the projects being discussed later are in East Renfrewshire, where \u00a344m is expected to be invested over the next few years, with much of the money coming from the City Deal funding. One is a water sports park at the Dams to Darnley Country Park. It would open in 2017 and include a centre offering wakeboarding, the fastest-growing extreme sport in the world.

        "article": "Though the unverified story was short on details, and did not have the husband's side of the story, \"divorced because of fat face\" quickly became a top trend on microblogging network Weibo. State media picked up the story on Thursday, which was first reported in a local evening paper earlier this week. Liaoshen Wanbao reported the 49-year-old woman in Shenyang city had claimed her husband had divorced her 10 years ago because he disliked the shape of her face, said to be \"large and square\" with \"fat cheeks\". She said it spurred her to undergo facial surgery three times at a local hospital to shave her jawbones and reshape her face into a slimmer shape. During the third surgery the doctors discovered that if they proceeded further her nerves may be damaged, and halted the procedure. The woman, identified only by her surname Wang, later sued the hospital for 1.7 million yuan ($260,900; \u00c2\u00a3183,900) in damages. She alleged the surgery had left her with soreness in her chin, and she could only eat and drink through a straw as \"when she exerted force on her lower jaw, she had the sensation that it would break\". The hospital, however, argued that the surgeries were conducted according to regulations, and pointed out that they encouraged her to seek psychiatric help instead of a third operation, which she refused. After mediation the woman agreed to accept 20,000 yuan ($3,100, \u00c2\u00a32,200) as compensation, said the report. On Weibo, some condemned the woman's husband, but others also chastised the woman. One top-voted comment read: \"It's purely an excuse, if her face was large then why did he decide to marry her in the first place? If he stopped loving her then he should have just said so.\" It continued: \"This woman is also very silly to have believed that her face shape was the real reason for the divorce, she is lying to herself.\" Said another Weibo user: \"Even if you had gone for facial surgery and made your face smaller, he would still have found other reasons to divorce you.\" One person noted the sharp difference in the compensation amount and voiced suspicions: \"1.7 million was dropped to 20,000, it makes me wonder if she really did have a problem with her jaw.\" Still others took the opportunity to crack jokes. \"What an odd reason for divorce! I wonder how square was this woman's square-shaped face? Like a television set? Microwave oven?\" Plastic surgery has long been a hot topic on Weibo. In December, users similarly expressed outrage when a Chinese man took out a newspaper advertisement pleading for his wife to go for plastic surgery. More than seven million cosmetic surgeries were performed in China in 2014. The industry's value, pegged at around 400bn yuan, is expected to double by 2019, according to the China Association of Plastics and Aesthetics.",

State media picked up the story on Thursday, which was first reported in a local evening paper earlier this week. Liaoshen Wanbao reported the 49-year-old woman in Shenyang city had claimed her husband had divorced her 10 years ago because he disliked the shape of her face, said to be \"large and square\" with \"fat cheeks\". She said it spurred her to undergo facial surgery three times at a local hospital to shave her jawbones and reshape her face into a slimmer shape. During the third surgery the doctors discovered that if they proceeded further her nerves may be damaged, and halted the procedure. The woman, identified only by her surname Wang, later sued the hospital for 1.7 million yuan ($260,900; \u00c2\u00a3183,900) in damages. She alleged the surgery had left her with soreness in her chin, and she could only eat and drink through a straw as \"when she exerted force on her lower jaw, she had the sensation that it would break\". The hospital, however, argued that the surgeries were conducted according to regulations, and pointed out that they encouraged her to seek psychiatric help instead of a third operation, which she refused. After mediation the woman agreed to accept 20,000 yuan ($3,100, \u00c2\u00a32,200) as compensation, said the report. On Weibo, some condemned the woman's husband, but others also chastised the woman. One top-voted comment read: \"It's purely an excuse, if her face was large then why did he decide to marry her in the first place? If he stopped loving her then he should have just said so.\" It continued: \"This woman is also very silly to have believed that her face shape was the real reason for the divorce, she is lying to herself.\" Said another Weibo user: \"Even if you had gone for facial surgery and made your face smaller, he would still have found other reasons to divorce you.\" One person noted the sharp difference in the compensation amount and voiced suspicions: \"1.7 million was dropped to 20,000, it makes me wonder if she really did have a problem with her jaw.\" Still others took the opportunity to crack jokes. \"What an odd reason for divorce! I wonder how square was this woman's square-shaped face? Like a television set? Microwave oven?\" Plastic surgery has long been a hot topic on Weibo. In December, users similarly expressed outrage when a Chinese man took out a newspaper advertisement pleading for his wife to go for plastic surgery. More than seven million cosmetic surgeries were performed in China in 2014. The industry's value, pegged at around 400bn yuan, is expected to double by 2019, according to the China Association of Plastics and Aesthetics.",

The apes began to disappear from the documents about 150 years ago, corresponding with population growth. The study is published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Hainan gibbons are now limited to a few isolated patches of forest in the south west of China. They live in just four social groups, one of which was only discovered a few weeks ago. Understanding this population crash has been difficult, but the old government documents have helped to reveal when and how the numbers fell. Dr Sam Turvey, from the Zoological Society of London, said: \"China is one of the few places in the world that has a very very rich, long historical record. \"Because it has had such a complex bureaucracy for so long, there has been a lot of need for reporting - not just numbers of households for tax purposes and things like that, but also in terms of the kinds of natural resources that were available in the immediate environment.\" These included records of animals, including gibbons, he said. \"We looked at the pattern of disappearance of gibbons through time and how that varied from place to place and the different environmental conditions and human pressures that were also present in these places.\" The archives show that gibbons were a common sight in about 20 provinces in China well into the 17th and 18th Century. However, Dr Turvey said it was \"a stark contrast to their very imperilled position today\". \"We see a really steep increase in population decline and real population collapse across China about 100-150 years ago,\" he added. \"And this correlates with demographic expansion in China towards the end of the Imperial era and through the 20th Century, and the massive increase in deforestation and human population growth through the time of the Chinese Republic and the establishment of the communist party.\" The researchers said a better understanding of the animals' decline would help them to establish a conservation plan for the country's last few Hainan gibbons. Dr Turvey said: \"It is an incredible privilege to be able to see gibbons in China in the wild. \"The Hainan gibbon is such as rare species, but knowing that this species is still hanging on there gives you hope that conservation will be able to bring that population back from the brink.\" Follow Rebecca on Twitter",

The apes began to disappear from the documents about 150 years ago, corresponding with population growth. The study is published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Hainan gibbons are now limited to a few isolated patches of forest in the south west of China. They live in just four social groups, one of which was only discovered a few weeks ago. Understanding this population crash has been difficult, but the old government documents have helped to reveal when and how the numbers fell. Dr Sam Turvey, from the Zoological Society of London, said: \"China is one of the few places in the world that has a very very rich, long historical record. \"Because it has had such a complex bureaucracy for so long, there has been a lot of need for reporting - not just numbers of households for tax purposes and things like that, but also in terms of the kinds of natural resources that were available in the immediate environment.\" These included records of animals, including gibbons, he said. \"We looked at the pattern of disappearance of gibbons through time and how that varied from place to place and the different environmental conditions and human pressures that were also present in these places.\" The archives show that gibbons were a common sight in about 20 provinces in China well into the 17th and 18th Century. However, Dr Turvey said it was \"a stark contrast to their very imperilled position today\". \"We see a really steep increase in population decline and real population collapse across China about 100-150 years ago,\" he added. \"And this correlates with demographic expansion in China towards the end of the Imperial era and through the 20th Century, and the massive increase in deforestation and human population growth through the time of the Chinese Republic and the establishment of the communist party.\" The researchers said a better understanding of the animals' decline would help them to establish a conservation plan for the country's last few Hainan gibbons. Dr Turvey said: \"It is an incredible privilege to be able to see gibbons in China in the wild. \"The Hainan gibbon is such as rare species, but knowing that this species is still hanging on there gives you hope that conservation will be able to bring that population back from the brink.\" Follow Rebecca on Twitter",

Here are some of the other most memorable - and surprising - moments from the last 30 years. Super Bowl performers get a very strict 12-minute time limit, so most performers cram their set with as much music as possible. Not Michael Jackson. After shooting onto the stage at the Pasadena Rose Bowl, he stood completely still, staring at the world for a full 90 seconds. Ninety. It was a master class in ratcheting expectation to a fever pitch. And the screams when he launched into Jam (not one of his best songs) proved he knew what he was doing. Brilliantly, Jackson staged this entire performance while wearing a jacket it looked like he'd borrowed from Muammar Gaddafi. Beat that, Gaga. Baby, he was born to run... and slide on his knees... and crotch slam a TV camera.

Even if they were fined for over-running by 40 seconds. Coldplay were the headline act at last year's Super Bowl in Santa Clara - but someone forgot to tell Beyonce. She only performed one song, Formation, underscoring its message of black pride and power with back-up dancers dressed in leather body suits and black berets reminiscent of the Black Panthers movement. Some of her dancers were even pictured holding up a sign declaring \"Justice 4 Mario Woods\" - a 26-year-old black man who was shot dead by armed police in San Francisco two months earlier. The performance heralded the arrival of her unapologetically political album, Lemonade, later in the year.

        "article": "With three defeats in his previous six bouts, the Scottish boxer's career seemed to be on the wane. But his power, timing and focus returned in a supremely confident display at Glasgow's Hydro on Saturday night as he clinched the vacant WBA World Super-Lightweight title - and entered the record books as the first Scot to win world titles at three weights. Italy's Michele Di Rocco, at 34 a year older than Burns, hadn't lost a fight since September 2007. He arrived with a record of 40 wins and a draw from 42 bouts. He left a lesser figure. The referee deemed the man from Assisi to be in no state to continue in the eighth round, the result of a welter of blows to his head and body and made all the more unbearable by the hostile acoustic energy generated by 8,000 Scottish fans. Surely, for Burns, this was time to shout about his record, the ideal moment to counter all those who had written him off and questioned the wisdom of him leaving trainer Billy Nelson two years ago to work with Tony Sim in Essex? No. Instead, the champion spoke of his disbelief at the ease of his victory, his gratitude that he was safe, of his thanks to promoter Eddie Hearn, manager Alex Morrison and coach Sim for believing in him, and of his desire to celebrate with a fast-food burger and 20 chicken nuggets. \"When I got in the ring after the fight, I said, 'You've done it! You've done it!',\" reported a beaming Hearn at the post-fight media conference. \"And you know what Ricky said? 'Can you get a picture with me and Michael Buffer [the legendary American boxing ring announcer]?'\" When he has time to reflect during a well-earned holiday, Burns will take immense satisfaction at being only the third British-born fighter, after Bob Fitzsimmons and Duke McKenzie, to be a three-weight world champion. In Scottish terms, his achievements must mean that he is in the very top tier of boxing greats, comfortably mentioned in the same breath as former world champions Benny Lynch, Walter McGowan, Jackie Paterson, Ken Buchanan and Jim Watt, for example. Burns' record stands at 40 wins from 46 bouts. Remarkably, 11 of those have been world title fights. Buchanan's exploits in the United States add lustre to his legacy, but while Burns may never have fought someone like Roberto Duran, should Hearn manage to set up a bout against Cincinnati's Adrien Broner, the four-time world champion stripped of the WBA title because he could not make the weight, then Burns could achieve little more in the sport. \"There are some big fights out there for me,\" said Burns. \"I want to fight the top names. I will fight anybody. I do super-lightweight comfortably and lightweight is still an option. I would fight Terence Crawford again if it came down to it. \"That's nearly two years I have been with Tony and things have just started clicking. \"I had a bit of a bad run in the last year with stuff.",

        "article": "With three defeats in his previous six bouts, the Scottish boxer's career seemed to be on the wane. But his power, timing and focus returned in a supremely confident display at Glasgow's Hydro on Saturday night as he clinched the vacant WBA World Super-Lightweight title - and entered the record books as the first Scot to win world titles at three weights. Italy's Michele Di Rocco, at 34 a year older than Burns, hadn't lost a fight since September 2007. He arrived with a record of 40 wins and a draw from 42 bouts. He left a lesser figure. The referee deemed the man from Assisi to be in no state to continue in the eighth round, the result of a welter of blows to his head and body and made all the more unbearable by the hostile acoustic energy generated by 8,000 Scottish fans. Surely, for Burns, this was time to shout about his record, the ideal moment to counter all those who had written him off and questioned the wisdom of him leaving trainer Billy Nelson two years ago to work with Tony Sim in Essex? No. Instead, the champion spoke of his disbelief at the ease of his victory, his gratitude that he was safe, of his thanks to promoter Eddie Hearn, manager Alex Morrison and coach Sim for believing in him, and of his desire to celebrate with a fast-food burger and 20 chicken nuggets. \"When I got in the ring after the fight, I said, 'You've done it! You've done it!',\" reported a beaming Hearn at the post-fight media conference. \"And you know what Ricky said? 'Can you get a picture with me and Michael Buffer [the legendary American boxing ring announcer]?'\" When he has time to reflect during a well-earned holiday, Burns will take immense satisfaction at being only the third British-born fighter, after Bob Fitzsimmons and Duke McKenzie, to be a three-weight world champion. In Scottish terms, his achievements must mean that he is in the very top tier of boxing greats, comfortably mentioned in the same breath as former world champions Benny Lynch, Walter McGowan, Jackie Paterson, Ken Buchanan and Jim Watt, for example. Burns' record stands at 40 wins from 46 bouts. Remarkably, 11 of those have been world title fights. Buchanan's exploits in the United States add lustre to his legacy, but while Burns may never have fought someone like Roberto Duran, should Hearn manage to set up a bout against Cincinnati's Adrien Broner, the four-time world champion stripped of the WBA title because he could not make the weight, then Burns could achieve little more in the sport. \"There are some big fights out there for me,\" said Burns. \"I want to fight the top names. I will fight anybody. I do super-lightweight comfortably and lightweight is still an option. I would fight Terence Crawford again if it came down to it. \"That's nearly two years I have been with Tony and things have just started clicking. \"I had a bit of a bad run in the last year with stuff.",

But his power, timing and focus returned in a supremely confident display at Glasgow's Hydro on Saturday night as he clinched the vacant WBA World Super-Lightweight title - and entered the record books as the first Scot to win world titles at three weights. Italy's Michele Di Rocco, at 34 a year older than Burns, hadn't lost a fight since September 2007. He arrived with a record of 40 wins and a draw from 42 bouts. He left a lesser figure. The referee deemed the man from Assisi to be in no state to continue in the eighth round, the result of a welter of blows to his head and body and made all the more unbearable by the hostile acoustic energy generated by 8,000 Scottish fans. Surely, for Burns, this was time to shout about his record, the ideal moment to counter all those who had written him off and questioned the wisdom of him leaving trainer Billy Nelson two years ago to work with Tony Sim in Essex? No. Instead, the champion spoke of his disbelief at the ease of his victory, his gratitude that he was safe, of his thanks to promoter Eddie Hearn, manager Alex Morrison and coach Sim for believing in him, and of his desire to celebrate with a fast-food burger and 20 chicken nuggets. \"When I got in the ring after the fight, I said, 'You've done it! You've done it!',\" reported a beaming Hearn at the post-fight media conference. \"And you know what Ricky said? 'Can you get a picture with me and Michael Buffer [the legendary American boxing ring announcer]?'\" When he has time to reflect during a well-earned holiday, Burns will take immense satisfaction at being only the third British-born fighter, after Bob Fitzsimmons and Duke McKenzie, to be a three-weight world champion. In Scottish terms, his achievements must mean that he is in the very top tier of boxing greats, comfortably mentioned in the same breath as former world champions Benny Lynch, Walter McGowan, Jackie Paterson, Ken Buchanan and Jim Watt, for example.
